Yes, we can!

{\an8}

805
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440

{\an8}ca

811
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,380
Tea Party Invitation

812
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,660
What?

813
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,720
Y-You've got to be kidding...

814
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,290
What the hell... Hey!

815
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,380
Where is everybody?!

816
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,170
What happened?! Grr! Who did this to Zou?!

817
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,610
Did the Straw Hats do this?!

818
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,260
What did they do to my home?!

819
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,140
This is a residential quarter where our ancestors used to live.

820
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,980
Zunesha has carried the whole history of the Mink Tribe without change.

821
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,110
One of the Mink Tribe's tradition that goes far back in that history is...

822
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,920
...exchanging clothes with foreigners, as a sign of friendship!

823
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,240
Oh, this is beautiful!
It's like a dress for somebody great.

824
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,940
Yes.
And that accessory is a national treasure.

825
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,730
What?! Are you giving it to me?!

826
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,260
Of course. Everyone agreed we should.

827
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,200
Garchu! Garchu-chu!

828
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,420
Mademoiselle, garchu.

829
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,440
Garchu.

830
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,650
How are you?! Garchu.

831
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,580
Garchu.

832
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,480
Tristan-chan!

833
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
Garchu!

834
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,820
Garchu!

835
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,960
Sanji-san, you sure like to greet everyone.

836
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,180
What is "garchu"?

837
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,840
Is it a miraculous magic word or something?

838
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,850
Sanji! It's from us to you, our great savior; Garchu!

839
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,280
Shut up! I don't want it from guys!

840
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,890
Oh, Sanji-san. Garchu!

841
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,980
Oh, boy! Viva minkship!

842
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,980
Is that a goddess?!

843
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,690
No...

844
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,700
Nami-san!

845
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,690
Garchu!

846
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,780
Where is Momo?

847
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,500
He's still locked in his room.
He feels more comfortable that way.

848
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,890
Plus, he shouldn't let them see his human form.

849
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,900
You're right.

850
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,580
We'd better not mention the word "samurai" while we're in this country.

851
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,240
Just give that annoying brat to the Minks
and let's leave this crappy island already!

852
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,580
Shut up!
Hey, Caesar, did you make the drugs?

853
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,120
I met my quota because I'm a genius.

854
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,890
Make more! Don't stop!

855
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,970
There are still so many injured people!

856
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,930
Keep working!

857
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,140
Why should I do such a thing...

858
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,940
Dr. Caesar, I came to pick up the drugs.

859
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,870
Hey, you're mistaken!
I'm Cedar the pharmacist!

860
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,880
Here.

861
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,610
Damn! Why am I making drugs to save people?!

862
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,010
Thank you, Dr. Caesar!

863
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,220
It's Cedar!

864
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,090
Man! This work disgraces my name, Caesar the genius mad scientist!

865
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,290
Oh yeah...

866
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,570
It's Cedar!

867
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,450
Baron Corpse,
your fans are waiting for you outside.

868
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,040
Erk!

869
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,030
I don't need popularity among dogs...

870
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,900
Pekoms!

871
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,160
It's you, Pekoms!

872
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,580
You're home!

873
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,540
Pekoms!

874
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,900
So you guys are all okay!

875
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,060
Dad! Mom!
All my relatives and friends!

876
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,710
Welcome home!

877
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,970
How long has it been?!

878
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,920
This brings back memories!

879
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,460
Yeah! You're looking good and I'm so happy!
Garchu!

880
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,750
You idiot! You're covered with cuts and bruises!
Don't tell me you're happy!

881
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,950
When I saw the city, I thought my heart would stop!

882
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,160
Garchu!

883
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,980
Hey!

884
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,960
You're hurting me!

885
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,280
It's all thanks to the Straw Hats!

886
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,900
If it weren't for their desperate rescue, I don't know what would've happened to us by now.

887
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,480
Really, thank you for staying alive!

888
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,060
Whoa-whoa, stop crying.

889
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,130
Damn!
I can't forgive Jack of the Beast Pirates!

890
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,740
How dare he do that to my home!

891
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,610
Look! Those guys from the Big Mom Pirates! They made it this far!

892
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,500
That's Pekoms! He came home.

893
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,150
He used to be an infamous delinquent.

894
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,660
Oh, so he's a Mink.

895
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,440
They must've heard this is where we were heading!

896
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,060
They want me!

897
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,090
Hey, please!
Don't hand me over to them.

898
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,150
You were our trump card against Doflamingo.

899
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,080
Now that Luffy and the others took him down, we don't care what happens to you.

900
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,900
Don't say such a thing! We're friends!

901
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,720
When did we become friends?!

902
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,420
You were whining about something at Dressrosa too. What did you do to Big Mom?

903
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,280
Oh, that's it! Hear me out!

904
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,570
I got an offer to research something which I haven't succeeded at yet,

905
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,760
and I lied to her and ripped her off pretty badly!

906
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,730
I had Doflamingo at my back so I pushed my luck!

907
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,170
So you asked for it.

908
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,960
I hope all they want is Caesar...

909
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,430
What?!

910
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,060
I'll kick your ass all over the New World...

911
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,980
...and make Fishman Island my territory!

912
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,270
Luffy picked a fight with Big Mom at Fishman Island.

913
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,160
We broke their ship too.

914
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,610
Hey, Black-Foot. Do you wanna work together with me and take them out?

915
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,200
Think about it!

916
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
Nami-san, stay with the rest here.

917
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay.

918
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,770
Brook, come with me.

919
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,640
Okay.

920
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,890
Hey, Black-Foot!
What about my cool idea to assassinate them?!

921
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,520
Idiots who can't think should shut up.

922
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,300
What do you Big Mom Pirates want?

923
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't cause trouble.

924
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,840
The people in this country are hurt inside and out now.

925
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,180
We're not gonna run or hide.

926
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,960
All I can say is thank you! Grr!

927
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,490
H-Hey...

928
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,820
I didn't expect to see my home country devastated like this...

929
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,750
But you guys saved the people, didn't you?!

930
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,800
I owe you greatly!

931
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,860
How can I thank you...?

932
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,520
By Mama's order, we have business other than capturing Caesar.

933
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,120
It could spell doom for your pirate group.

934
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,730
Doom?

935
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,580
So let's forget it! The mission failed!
Just give us Caesar!

936
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll just tell Mom that we let the Straw Hats get away!

937
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,330
Pekoms! Are you losing your mind?!
Put your feelings aside!

938
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,700
Shut up, newbie! I'll take the punishment!

939
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,700
They saved my family members and friends.

940
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,460
I can't do anything to them...

941
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,090
You coward!

942
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,540
You bastard!

943
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,970
He shot his ally in the back!

944
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,460
How could he do that?!

945
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,970
What did I just see?

946
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,630
He may not look like it but he's quite a well-known pirate.

947
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,200
However, when he chose to act on his pathetic feelings, he turned into such a coward.

948
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,810
There's no longer any use for him.

949
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,660
I'll do it myself!

950
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,840
Alright, guys! Come on out!

951
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,740
Go!

952
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,200
What?!

953
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,240
What?! Humans?!

954
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,740
What the hell?!

955
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,870
Give up! You're outnumbered!

956
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,820
Did the humans come out of his stomach?!

957
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,940
What kind of ability is that?!

958
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,030
I thought I saw humans in his hand but, that wasn't an illusion!

959
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,120
I ate the Castle Fruit and became a castle human.

960
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm regarded in the same generation as your captain, so you know me, don't you?

961
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,850
Captain of the Firetank Pirates

962
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,850
Capone "Gang" Bege

963
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,850
Bounty: 300 million berry

964
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,940
When Luffy punched the Celestial Dragon at Sabaody, you were there, weren't you?!

965
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,880
We're not gonna make a scene here.
We don't want that, either.

966
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,660
If the Minks come, they'll definitely take your side.

967
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,680
I know how well they can fight.

968
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,250
Vito!

969
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,220
No! Let go of me!

970
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,920
Nami-san!

971
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,030
Chopper-san!

972
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,710
I-I'm sorry!
We couldn't help worrying so...

973
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,100
I'm sorry! I thought there were only two enemies!

974
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,420
Oh...

975
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,680
Caesar! Why don't you come out, too?!

976
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,220
We'll fire shotguns containing Sea Prism Stone towards the sky in two seconds!

977
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,020
Two!

978
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,840
One!

979
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,800
Wait a sec! I'm here! Don't shoot!

980
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,050
Don't point them at me!

981
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,320
Come to think of it, we don't have any bullets containing Sea Prism Stone.

982
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,190
What?!

983
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,080
But we have a spear that works like that!

984
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,080
Rather than standing around here talking, get into my castle.

985
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,280
That's an order!

986
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,600
Damn! He's completely in control.

987
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,740
Thank you for waiting.

988
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,440
Would you guys like to eat something?

989
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,790
No thanks.

990
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,320
You don't have to be humble.
Maybe a glass of wine?

991
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,240
We don't want anything!
Get down to business already!

992
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,410
He'll kill us! He'll kill us! He'll kill us!

993
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,680
You should cut yourself some slack sometimes.

994
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,500
We exchanged gunfire at sea a week ago, but the situation has changed since then.

995
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,600
I was asked to hand you this invitation.

996
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,000
It's an invitation to Mama's tea party.

997
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,340
Cut the crap.

998
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,710
Why would I wanna go to Big Mom's tea party?

999
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,480
The highlight of the party will be a wedding ceremony.

1000
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,830
The groom is the third son of the Vinsmoke Family...

1001
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,310
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1002
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,300
Sanji!

1003
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,640
What?!

1004
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,900
What?!

1005
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,110
What?!!

1006
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,450
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1007
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,090
The bride is the 35th daughter of the Charlotte Family,

1008
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,360
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1009
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,740
The bride is the 35th daughter of the Charlotte Family, Pudding.

1010
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,340
TEA PARTY

1011
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,460
D-During a tea party...

1012
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,520
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1013
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,520
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1014
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,720
They'll hold Sanji's wedding?!

1015
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,750
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1016
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,750
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1017
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,050
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1018
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,050
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1019
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,980
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1020
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,980
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1021
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,960
Take it.

1022
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,810
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1023
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,810
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1024
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,810
TEA PARTY

1025
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,760
Groom   Third son of the Vinsmoke family    Sanji

1026
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,760
Bride   35th daughter of the Charlotte family   Pudding

1027
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,890
Why, after all these years?!

1028
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,990
Third son of the Vinsmoke family

1029
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,990
I don't know the deal with your family!

1030
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,740
You bastard! Are you trying to set fire to my castle?!

1031
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,380
Hey, Sanji-kun, what is this all about?!

1032
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,280
Are you gonna get married?!

1033
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,980
Who made the decision without asking?!

1034
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Your family, of course!

1035
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,600
Being a son of the Vinsmoke family means you're quite ill-bred.

1036
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,740
V-V-Vinsmoke is Sanji-san's surname?!

1037
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,920
The name gives me chills down my spine.

1038
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,530
But no, that's not possible.

1039
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,120
Hey, bring me a glass of wine!

1040
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,700
Yes, sir!

1041
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Sanji-kun's family...

1042
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,770
Oh!

1043
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,720
"Noland the Liar"?

1044
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
You know it, Sanji-kun?

1045
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,180
But it says it was published in the North Blue.

1046
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,620
Yeah. I was born in the North Blue.

1047
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,230
Haven't I told you guys?

1048
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,980
That's news. I thought you were from the East, too.

1049
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,240
I grew up there. Well, who cares.

1050
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,390
I remember feeling strange at that time.

1051
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,740
We met him in the East Blue
but he said he was born in the North Blue.

1052
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,180
What?! Are you sure, Nami-san?!

1053
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,580
If that's true, it's a big deal!

1054
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,860
In order to move to the East Blue from the North Blue, you have to surmount the Red Line!

1055
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,030
That's right!

1056
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,140
Is it difficult?

1057
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,680
Yes, it's not just one family moving to another place!

1058
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,780
It's a great voyage!

1059
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,520
What kind of childhood did Sanji-san have?

1060
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,190
And, you know,
Charlotte is Big Mom's surname!

1061
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,960
What?!

1062
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,560
That fool! Is he gonna marry Big Mom's daughter?!

1063
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,700
Will he join an Emperor's family?!

1064
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,450
If your fellow crewmember becomes her son-in-law, you guys will practically be her subordinates!

1065
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,720
What?!

1066
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,180
Don't jump to conclusions!

1067
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm under no obligation to go to such a tea party!

1068
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,990
How ridiculous!

1069
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,660
My wedding ceremony?

1070
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,490
Marrying a woman I don't even know?!

1071
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,000
You've got to be kidding me!

1072
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,370
I don't want the Straw Hats to become your subordinates either!

1073
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,060
Our captain isn't the type of guy who works under someone!

1074
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,030
Luffy will...

1075
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
...become the King of the Pirates!

1076
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,450
Are we done here? You can have Caesar.

1077
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,690
What?!

1078
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,890
I think you have the wrong idea.
The invitation was only for you to see.

1079
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,960
I wasn't looking for your answer.

1080
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,680
You're in my body!

1081
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,930
You guys have already been captured!
I'll take you all to Mama!

1082
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,620
What?!

1083
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,870
I'm sure you don't feel any motion...

1084
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,450
but I'm already on the move.

1085
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,960
Is it really moving?!

1086
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,520
No! She'll kill me! Let me out!

1087
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,180
You...

1088
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,120
If you wanna fight, I'll fight you.

1089
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,850
What the...!

1090
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,140
Sanji-kun!

1091
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,720
I have full command over the interior of the castle!

1092
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,960
Everything is under my control!

1093
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,700
Help!

1094
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,220
Nami's sinking!

1095
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,010
Nami-san!

1096
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,020
Stop it!

1097
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,560
I said stop it!

1098
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,080
Are you alright?

1099
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,980
Uh-huh.

1100
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,350
What a relief!

1101
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,440
Even if I don't rough you up,
you won't get away from Mama's tea party.

1102
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,740
That's common knowledge throughout the New World.

1103
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,660
That's right. Mama hates bitter sweets and empty seats at tea parties-rero.

1104
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,380
When someone refuses her because he's ignorant-rero,

1105
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,960
he'll cry in regret later

1106
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,340
Advisor of the Firetank Pirates
"Phantom Gun" Vito

1107
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,340
and I can't bear to see that-rero!

1108
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,840
When you get an invitation to a tea party from Big Mom-rero,

1109
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,180
that's basically an undeclinable summons!

1110
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,950
Even the devil himself comes from hell to attend Mama's tea party, they say!

1111
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Of course, you have a choice not to go-rero.

1112
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,460
But if you refuse...

1113
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,770
Listen to me-rero.

1114
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,510
How did you find that out?

1115
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,880
That's a silly question.

1116
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,300
Who do you think our master is?

1117
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,790
The Four Emperors are the most powerful pirates there are, reigning supreme over the New World,

1118
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,300
one of them being Big Mom herself.

1119
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,730
She has it all.

1120
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,400
If she tells someone she'll kill him, he'll die.

1121
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,570
She doesn't bluff.

1122
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,780
Stake your life on every word you say.

1123
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,180
If you wish to stay alive without becoming anybody's subordinate,

1124
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,780
do as she says, at least for now.

1125
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,660
Sanji-san! Are you okay?

1126
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,160
What did he say to you earlier?

1127
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,440
What's the matter, Sanji?!
We'll fight even against an Emperor!

1128
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,740
Be quiet!

1129
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,740
Give me some paper and a pen.

1130
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,920
Are you gonna leave a note for Straw Hat?

1131
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,370
Hand this to Luffy and everybody.

1132
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,480
Sanji-kun...

1133
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
Nami-san.

1134
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,120
Chopper.

1135
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,040
Brook.

1136
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,820
Believe this if nothing else.

1137
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,240
I didn't mean to hide anything from my friends.

1138
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:19,040
That's something from the past
that I thought I'd never have to deal with again.

1139
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,880
I really need to go and sort things out!

1140
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,410
Wait a minute, Sanji-san.
Do you mean "by yourself"?

1141
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,710
I feel a powerful presence outside.
It's probably one of the Minks.

1142
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,220
Are you ready?

1143
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,650
Ready?

1144
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,720
Good luck!

1145
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,870
What about me?!

1146
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,910
That fool!

1147
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,440
He freed his allies!

1148
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,920
That bastard!

1149
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,740
Don't move, you bastards!

1150
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,910
Why...?

1151
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,860
Okay, listen carefully!

1152
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,660
I bet you don't want me to blow your precious genius scientist's brains out!

1153
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,090
I'll get even with you, Black-Foot!

1154
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,330
I thought so.

1155
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,540
You fools can't kill me either, can you?!

1156
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Hearing about this marriage solves a mystery for me.

1157
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,260
My wanted poster says "Only alive"!

1158
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,110
You gotta catch me alive!

1159
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,760
If you kill me, you'd piss somebody off,
wouldn't you?!

1160
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,320
Have you been told to treat me civilly without even cuffs?!

1161
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,690
The person who made them write that phrase on the poster and the one who arranged my marriage

1162
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,700
must be the same person!

1163
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,330
Damn! Let's get out and chase them!

1164
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,160
I said not to move!

1165
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,530
Please don't move!

1166
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,900
You know someone's got my back now, don't you?!

1167
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,240
Don't worry! I'll come with you.
To sort things out with that person!

1168
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,080
So don't do anything to my friends!

1169
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,680
All of you, stay where you are!

1170
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,760
What?!

1171
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,490
Father!

1172
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,580
There is a... monster... outside now!

1173
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,640
Master Nekomamushi...

1174
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,840
Cat monster!
I didn't know there was such a terrible thing here!

1175
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,880
Hey!

1176
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,300
You-gara, who are you?

1177
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,550
I saw Pekoms lying down back there bleeding.

1178
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,330
No, you got it wrong! I'm his crewmate!

1179
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,660
Crewmate?

1180
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,930
Yes, we belong to the same pirate group!

1181
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,800
We've actually been attacked by the remnants of Jack's crew!

1182
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,000
That's not true!

1183
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Why would I shoot my ally?!

1184
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,490
Sanji-kun, come on out!
Why do you wanna stay?!

1185
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,140
Tell us what's really going on, Sanji!

1186
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,140
What do you mean you need to go?!
Why can't we all go together?!

1187
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,650
Let's wait for Luffy-san and everybody,
Sanji-san!

1188
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,950
This is my problem.

1189
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,520
I'll be back.

1190
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,900
Tell them "Hi" for me.

1191
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,740
Castle Tank!

1192
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,160
Sanji!

1193
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,880
Sanji-kun!

1194
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,460
Nami! Chopper! Should I just chase him?!

1195
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,640
No, it's no use, Wanda-san!

1196
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,130
Baron Corpse!

1197
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,960
Even if we can catch up to him,
he has...

1198
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,000
...no intentions of coming back now!

1199
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,000
To my buddies,
I'm off to see a woman.
I'll be back.

Sanji
