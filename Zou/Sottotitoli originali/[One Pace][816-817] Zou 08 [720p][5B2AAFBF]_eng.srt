780
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

781
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

782
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

783
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

784
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}

785
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}yes

786
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}we

787
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}can!

788
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

789
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

790
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

791
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

792
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

793
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

794
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

795
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

796
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,490
Raizo of the Mist

797
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,500
We have a problem! Kin'emon and Kanjurou must've arrived already!

798
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,790
Because of some samurai named Raizo who isn't even here, the Mokomo Dukedom was destroyed!

799
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,530
If they meet the Minks and say they're looking for Raizo,

800
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,050
it's gonna be messy!

801
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,580
Anyway, we have to stop those two!

802
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,200
Yeah!

803
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,160
Let's go!

804
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,360
This is serious-saru! This is serious-saru!

805
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,400
Bariete's ringing the bell!

806
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,420
Samurai-saru!
Samurai are here-saru!

807
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,840
Let's go to the city!
Tell everyone who is capable to follow me!

808
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,580
Yes, sir!

809
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,220
Duke-sama! Your Warney is ready!

810
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,720
By the way, that bell is very noisy.
It's been ringing constantly.

811
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,660
Isn't it a bell to tell everyone they have a visitor?

812
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,020
They must be welcoming us!

813
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,770
That's certainly possible!

814
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,180
But Law-dono was saying that...

815
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,010
...the inhabitants of Zou who don't like humans
are actually the Mink Tribe.

816
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes, is that what people are saying?
I can't understand why.

817
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,460
If that's what people are saying these days...

818
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,780
Father! Kanjurou!

819
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,090
Momonosuke!

820
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,960
Kanjurou! So you're all right!

821
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,000
Ah, I'm sorry to make you worry.

822
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,480
Now, why are you here alone?
Where are Luffy-dono and everybody?

823
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,060
Actually, I haven't been at ease
since we came to this country

824
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,130
so I've been sleeping in a room by myself.

825
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh no!

826
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
You poor thing.

827
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,380
I see. Then come with us.

828
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,030
I guess they're assembling to welcome us!

829
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,180
Why?! Why?! Why?!
Why should I be running this early in the morning?!

830
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,530
I told you! Kin'emon and...
What was his name?!

831
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,590
Kanjurou!

832
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,560
Yes! Those two arrived!

833
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,980
They say two samurai appeared
and the whole country is in a great uproar!

834
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,220
Master Nekomamushi headed for the city
leading the Guardians!

835
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,270
Another welcome banquet?!
I wouldn't mind having one for two consecutive days!

836
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,720
No, they've got a score to settle!

837
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,560
Of course, they do!

838
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,840
They were wrongly accused of hiding a samurai
and almost died!

839
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,310
Where are they?!

840
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,240
We'll find them right away!

841
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,060
People across the country
keep rolling into the city...

842
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Pedro! Can you see them?!

843
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,900
This is no good.

844
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,140
Can't you find the samurai yet?!

845
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,480
We're on the hunt now!

846
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,150
Master, please pull back!

847
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,680
Pull back?!

848
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,540
Hurry up!

849
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,030
Humph! What are you talking about?!

850
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,580
Please. Just keep going.

851
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh... Oh no! The two ran into each other!

852
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,240
Master!

853
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
Duke-sama!

854
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,740
Please don't do it, Master!

855
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,830
Duke-sama! Please calm down!

856
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,120
Is it a fight?

857
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,220
That's...

858
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,120
Man! That was...

859
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,300
...Really close!

860
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,230
You three, take my advice
and go back to the Sunny now!

861
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,700
How many years has it been, cat monster?
You've become even more monstrous.

862
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,320
What about you-gara?
You've lost one of your legs.

863
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,760
What should we do?!

864
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,580
Somebody, please stop them!

865
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,700
Where is Raizo?!

866
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,840
Give us Raizo!

867
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
I know Raizo is in this country!

868
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,680
We don't have such a person here!
How many times do I have to tell you?!

869
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
Search through the country as you please!
We don't have a samurai...

870
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,160
I wonder if you'll say goodbye to this leg first,
or tell us where the samurai is.

871
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,040
Let's try it, "Dog King."

872
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,740
Then, there is no way
for me to save this leg.

873
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,100
You-gara got your hand chopped off.
You can't fight anymore.

874
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,080
The most you can do is eat lasagna.

875
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,820
Say it! Where's the samurai?!

876
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,250
How can I tell you something I don't know?!

877
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,490
A person from the Land of
Wano has no business here!

878
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,760
All you can do is use poison gas
and attack the weakened men!

879
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,300
You cowards!

880
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,960
Oh no! This guy's trying to break the chains!

881
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,470
Is the gas really working?!
Immobilize his arms!

882
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,360
Yeah, you'd better do that!

883
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,280
If you have time to harm my people,
point your spear at me!

884
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,580
No... Master!

885
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,360
I'll take all of those crappy spears myself!

886
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,580
Master!

887
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,280
It's a shame that
you-gara have only lost one of your legs!

888
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,620
I wouldn't mind if you were dead.

889
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,460
One king is enough for the country!

890
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,540
Please stop, both of you!

891
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,130
Then let's send one of us to kingdom come!

892
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,380
You-gara must die!

893
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
A dog and a cat?!

894
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,420
Hey!

895
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,240
I heard about it before,
but they're really strong!

896
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,100
Hey, wait!

897
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,740
Stop fighting!

898
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,540
Hey, you idiot! What are you doing?!

899
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,440
That's...

900
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,260
...a samurai!

901
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,060
See?! They found you!

902
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,310
Run, Kin'emon! They're gonna kill you!

903
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,700
Momo-chan!

904
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,740
Hey, let go of me! Please!

905
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,260
What are you gonna do?!

906
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,720
Momo, stay away!

907
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Kanjurou! Why did you guys come out?!

908
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,240
Run! Now!

909
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,840
Nekomamushi! Inuarashi! Wait a minute!

910
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,290
They really mean no harm!

911
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,350
People from the country of Zou!

912
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm a retainer of the Kozuki Clan from
the Land of Wano, named Kin'emon!

913
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm here to look for my comrade named Raizo who is a warrior from the same country!

914
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,380
Has he been here?!

915
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,090
Well, this country was destroyed
because he wasn't here!

916
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,040
Luffy!

917
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,020
Yeah...

918
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,140
We've been expecting you.

919
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,700
I don't know Raizo! I swear to god!

920
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,890
If the man you're talking about is here,
you can take my life!

921
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Raizo-dono is...

922
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,540
...safe!

923
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,460
Oh, he's safe! I'm relieved!

924
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,160
Whoa, wait a minute!

925
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,530
Hey, was Raizo here all this time?!

926
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,550
Did you all know?!

927
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:40,100
Y-Y-Y-You all almost died!

928
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,020
The millennium-old city was ruined!

929
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm sorry that we kept it a secret
from you-gara guys too.

930
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,440
The Land of Wano's Kozuki Clan
and we have been like a family since way back.

931
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,920
No matter what will be ruined,
we'd never sell out our friends!

932
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,420
Hey!

933
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,830
Yes, sir!

934
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,000
What do you think? Am I dead?

935
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,580
N-No! Definitely not!

936
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,840
You're alive, Jack-sama!

937
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,540
I'm deeply grateful to you all!

938
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,500
And now, as proof, I offer you this!

939
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,460
Yes, that's certainly the same Kozuki Clan crest that Duke-sama, Master and Raizo-san have!

940
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,940
Kozuki...

941
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,240
I can't believe they know each other!

942
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,720
I was really prepared for a
clash against the Minks! Jeez!

943
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,770
It couldn't be helped.
They couldn't have told the whole story even to us.

944
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,770
She just said the doggy and the kitty
have the same crest.

945
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,650
Maybe, their bond is far
stronger than we realize.

946
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,380
But Inuarashi, Nekomamushi...

947
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,000
It is surprising to see you two
alive and well here!

948
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,810
Death would've been a relief to us.

949
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,930
But we thought if we trust the words
from that day and wait here...

950
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah, then we would get
to see you-gara guys one day!

951
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,050
Hey, cat monster!

952
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,640
I was talking to Kin'emon!

953
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,970
Don't interrupt as you please!

954
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,000
I was just thinking Kin'emon must be
sick of talking to you-gara

955
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,770
so I tactfully took over!

956
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,400
I thought they were cooled down.

957
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,070
Well...

958
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,760
You-gara served your purpose! Get lost!

959
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,320
You get lost!

960
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,680
Please stop, both of you!
Our long-awaited guests have just arrived!

961
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,130
Stop fighting! Inuarashi! Nekomamushi!

962
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,990
You two used to be such good friends! Why have you been fighting like you wanna kill each other?!

963
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,760
Well...

964
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,320
I forbid you to ever fight again!

965
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,410
It's even more inexcusable
if it's because of my father!

966
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,600
It would make my father sad
to see you two like this...

967
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,560
Oden-sama...

968
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Momo?

969
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,310
Did you say it'd make your father sad?

970
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,290
But Kin'emon's right here.

971
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,880
I'm sorry!

972
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,920
Momonosuke-sama! I'm ashamed of myself!
You're absolutely right!

973
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,120
What?!

974
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,090
Duke-sama!

975
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,640
I can't believe Master's bowing his head!

976
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,800
Would that child be...

977
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,900
Momonosuke-sama is right!

978
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,000
Please forgive me for lying to you all, too!

979
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,370
To tell you the truth, Momonosuke-sama and I are...

980
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,200
...not father and son!

981
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,370
What?!

982
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,070
This man right here is the heir to...

983
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,540
...Kozuki Oden-sama, great daimyo of Kuri in the Land of Wano!

984
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,180
Kingdom of Wano
Heir of the Daimyo of Kuri
Kozuki Momonosuke

985
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,400
His name is Kozuki Momonosuke-sama!

986
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,020
That means for all of us including
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi,

987
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,360
he's our lord!

988
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,260
So he's the heir of the Kozuki Family
and Oden-dono's son!

989
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,570
How could I miss that?!

990
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,140
What? Is Momo someone important?

991
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,000
If they're heading the list of his retainers,
he could be quite a powerful lord.

992
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Along the way, if his true identity was revealed,
we could've attracted more enemies

993
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,360
so we pretended as if we were father and son.

994
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,010
Although we trusted you all,
we never had a good chance to tell you.

995
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,810
I apologize.

996
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,060
So you're not father and son.

997
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,400
But they're alike. They're both perverts.

998
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm sorry that I was lying!
I'm actually an important figure!

999
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,270
Yes, and a pervert.

1000
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,120
No, I'm not!

1001
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,270
Whatever!

1002
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,410
What do you mean by that?!
Bow down, Luffy!

1003
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,780
No way!

1004
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,710
Why do we have to change our behavior just because you're an important person?! Idiot!

1005
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,650
M-Momonosuke-sama!

1006
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,680
You're afraid of heights
and you have no guts!

1007
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,700
We samurai aren't afraid of anything!
How rude!

1008
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,810
Here we go again.
He saved our lives but...

1009
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,440
You can't ask a pirate to be humble.

1010
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
Momonosuke-sama's getting
distracted, so that's good.

1011
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,650
So frustrating, Onami!
Luffy is a terrible guy!

1012
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,330
Oh, there, there.

1013
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,820
Stay away from her, Momonosuke-sama!
You damn brat!

1014
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,500
Hey!

1015
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,080
Say, Momo-chan,

1016
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,770
if your father is a lord, there must be
treasure in his castle, isn't that right?

1017
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,000
Cut it out!

1018
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,360
You're really a bad person!

1019
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,520
It's only been a few months since...

1020
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,640
Their-gara cheeriness must be helping him.

1021
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
Let's make a truce, cat.

1022
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,060
If we keep dwelling in the past,
we'll make Momonosuke-sama suffer.

1023
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,370
Okay, for the sake of our lord!

1024
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,510
I'll communicate with you-gara
but won't connect with you-gara!

1025
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,140
That's a deal!

1026
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,190
Oh! Look at that!

1027
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,820
Those two are... No way!

1028
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,240
It's a miracle!

1029
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,620
Our two kings made up!

1030
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,930
The King of the Day and the King of the Night finally...

1031
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,340
How amazing the Kozuki Family's power is!

1032
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,620
It makes me cry!

1033
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,760
Dr. Miyagi! You're hopping too much!

1034
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,370
Let's climb the whale.

1035
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,010
If you learn which vines to take,
you can reach the top.

1036
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,250
So Raizo's here?!

1037
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,220
Nin-nin!

1038
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,480
Nin-nin!

1039
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,750
Nin-nin!

1040
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,020
Nin-nin!

1041
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,220
Nin-nin!

1042
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,370
Nin-nin!

1043
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,580
Nin-nin!

1044
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,880
Nin-nin!

1045
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,560
Can't wait to see the ninja! Nin-nin!

1046
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,100
I get to see a ninja! Nin-nin!

1047
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,600
The Watery Escape Technique! Nin-nin!

1048
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,250
I still don't feel well, Kin'emon.

1049
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,650
You can wait at the bottom if you want,
Momonosuke-sama.

1050
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,400
As we get closer to the whale,
the voice I hear is getting louder.

1051
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,560
You have a similar ability to Oden-sama.

1052
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,000
There was another man
who used to say something like that.

1053
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,860
I was just thinking about the same thing.

1054
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,420
Oh, I can't believe there's an entrance here!

1055
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,380
On the tail of the Whale Tree?!
No one would notice!

1056
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,200
And it's a hidden door
so it's impossible to find.

1057
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,160
Let's go.

1058
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,700
It's a long flight of stairs so be careful.

1059
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
Is that...

1060
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,070
That's Raizo's voice.

1061
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,810
What?! The ninja?!

1062
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,140
Ninja!

1063
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,940
Ninja!

1064
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,360
Where's the ninja?!

1065
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,700
Ninja! Ninja!

1066
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,610
Here we are.

1067
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,820
He-gara is the ninja, Raizo.

1068
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,650
Ninja! Nin...

1069
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,260
There you are, Nekomamushi!

1070
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,000
You! Why didn't you just hand me over to them?!

1071
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,810
Ninja from the Kingdom of Wano
Raizo of the Mist

1072
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Everyone that brought me food here...

1073
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,300
...was injured!

1074
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,670
They told me the country is okay,
but is it true?!

1075
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,760
If it's a lie, I, Raizo, will hate you!

1076
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,290
What?!

1077
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,530
He's nothing like we expected!

1078
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,120
I don't think you guys are from this country!
Who are you?!

1079
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,370
Raizo!

1080
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,630
Kin'emon! Kanjuro! Momonosuke-sama!

1081
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm glad that you're okay!

1082
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,550
We're glad you're okay too!

1083
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,900
That's...

1084
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,620
The crest of the Kozuki Family!

1085
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,060
The same as Kin'emon's!

1086
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,860
That crest has existed for centuries.

1087
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,200
And that stone is...

1088
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,660
I've never seen it in such a color.
Deep red...

1089
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,370
Yeah, it's a Poneglyph.

1090
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,900
We know you-gara, Nico Robin.

1091
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,590
I heard the Ohara people
can read those letters.

1092
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,580
Why is that Poneglyph red?

1093
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,400
None of the Poneglyphs I've ever seen
were that color.

1094
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,160
It has a different purpose.

1095
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,570
Can you read it?

1096
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Yes, may I?

1097
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,100
Of course, you may.

1098
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,920
What's wrong with you guys?
Why are you staring hard at me like that?

1099
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,100
Are you really a ninja?

1100
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,380
How insolent! Who are you?!

1101
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,460
We haven't introduced them to you yet.

1102
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,760
Raizo, they're the Straw Hats.
They're pirates.

1103
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,550
Pirates?

1104
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,220
If you're a real ninja, throw a shuriken!

1105
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,620
Meditate under a waterfall!

1106
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,940
Say "Nin" and use ninja powers!

1107
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,180
I wanna see the Earth Escape Technique!

1108
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,940
I want the fire version!

1109
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,450
No, the water version!

1110
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,340
Such rapid-fire requests!

1111
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,980
Why do you pirates want to see it so badly?!

1112
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,480
It's not because we're pirates.

1113
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
Super!

1114
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,760
All boys like ninjas!

1115
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,720
That makes me blush.

1116
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,560
Hey, have you ever gone out
with a female ninja?!

1117
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,680
Train your jumping ability
by jumping over a bamboo shoot every day!

1118
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,560
Show me the Shadow Clone Technique.

1119
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,320
Hide in the ceiling and
get stabbed by a spear.

1120
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,870
Summon a giant frog!

1121
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,700
Hold a scroll in your
mouth and say "Nin-nin"!

1122
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,780
Oh, shut up!

1123
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,760
Stop imposing your damn dreams on me!

1124
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,590
We ninja don't say things like "Nin-nin"!
The ninja in your heads are all fantasies!

1125
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,280
What?!

1126
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,100
Then, what makes you a ninja?!
It can't be your physique!

1127
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,080
That's right. With this physique,
I can't even attract female ninjas...

1128
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,980
Hey, shut up!

1129
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,780
Listen! It takes a quiet and
tough mind to be a master ninja!

1130
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,900
We're supposed to be living in the shadows.
We can't show off our techniques.

1131
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,040
Ninjutsu is not entertainment...

1132
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,880
Ninpo - Smoke Escape Technique!

1133
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,460
He disappeared!

1134
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,880
I didn't disappear!

1135
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm here.

1136
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,200
Wh-What?!

1137
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,600
And here!

1138
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,920
Here too!

1139
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
And here too!

1140
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,410
What?! He's got doubles?!

1141
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,800
Could it be...?!

1142
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,340
Ninpo - Shadow Clone Technique!

1143
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,220
Cool!

1144
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Did you doubt I was really a ninja?

1145
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,240
Flower Shuriken!

1146
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,110
{\an8}Note: shinobi

1147
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,870
Never popular with girls
but still an invincible ninja!

1148
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,120
Raizo of the Mist is now...

1149
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,460
...here before your eyes!

1150
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,100
Raizo!

1151
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,080
Nin! Nin!

1152
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,000
