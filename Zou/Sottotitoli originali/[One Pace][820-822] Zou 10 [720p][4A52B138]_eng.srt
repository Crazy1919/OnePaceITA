780
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

781
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

782
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

783
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

784
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}

785
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}yes

786
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}we

787
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}can!

788
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

789
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

790
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

791
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

792
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

793
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

794
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

795
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

796
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,100
Understood

797
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,660
It's Shanks!

798
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,180
Don't tell me you know him, Nekomamushi.

799
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,170
Yes, I know him!
"Red-Haired" Shanks, right?

800
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,210
I see!
No wonder that straw hat looks familiar!

801
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,160
Oh, does it?!

802
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,100
Inuarashi said that too!
Do you all know Shanks?!

803
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,270
Yes, because both the cat and I were once
traveling on Roger's ship.

804
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,030
What?!

805
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,860
Were you guys the Pirate King's crewmembers?!

806
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,720
Crewmembers...
Well, you can put it that way too but...

807
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,370
...we boarded many ships
as Oden-sama's attendants.

808
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,830
Even when we were traveling
on Whitebeard's Moby Dick.

809
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,820
And when Oden-sama was recruited by Roger,
we were always by his side...

810
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,830
Whoa, wait, wait! Whitebeard?!

811
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,850
Yes. We were still young...

812
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,230
...just like the apprentices
such as Shanks and Buggy.

813
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,880
Hey, wait! Stop! Stop!

814
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,070
I'm completely lost! Um...

815
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,890
But the two of us didn't
go to Raftel with them.

816
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,540
I said "Wait a minute"!

817
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,840
Um, first, on Whitebeard's ship,

818
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,870
there was Oden, the dog and the cat.

819
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,870
O
D
E
N

820
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,510
And then Oden was recruited by Roger
and you three switched to Roger's ship.

821
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,390
Yeah, I remember!
We were having so much fun at that time!

822
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,060
Oh, the species, geographical features, and climates
that I'd never seen!

823
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,080
The sea of clouds in the sky!

824
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,070
The island that floats undersea!
The sunlight!

825
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,110
Every day, I was very excited!

826
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,140
Those good old adventurous days!

827
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,610
You two were trying to kill each other earlier,
weren't you?

828
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,060
Then, Kin'emon, were you guys traveling
on Whitebeard's ship too?

829
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,850
No, we stayed in the Wano Country
the whole time.

830
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,730
Instead, we were trying
desperately to stop Oden-sama

831
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,110
from getting on board a pirate ship!

832
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,440
In the closed-off nation,
even leaving the country is a crime.

833
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,630
On the other hand, Oden-sama was a heretic

834
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,410
who had doubts about the law of the country.

835
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,610
We became acquainted with
Whitebeard, Roger and the

836
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,640
others when they landed on the Wano Country.

837
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,300
They were loyal to others
and we didn't think they were particularly bad people.

838
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,690
But I'd never heard of a daimyo
getting aboard a pirate ship so as his retainer...

839
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,190
So anyway, you all know Shanks!
And Rayleigh as well?!

840
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,380
Yes, of course!

841
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,300
If you got on board Roger's ship,

842
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,900
it must've been the Oro Jackson which was
built by my shipwright teacher Tom-san!

843
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,780
What?!
Are you the shipwright Tom's pupil?!

844
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,770
Um, can I go next?
Then, I bet you know Crocus the ship doctor...

845
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,820
Wait, Brook.

846
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Sorry to interrupt you.
I gotta check something with them.

847
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,810
You said the four Road Poneglyphs will
show us the way to Raftel, right?

848
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm starting to worry about the route.

849
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,800
Look.

850
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,570
The needles on the Log Pose!

851
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,370
Normally, we choose our next destination
looking at where these three needles point

852
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,620
but we're not tracking them now.
Is it okay?!

853
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,000
We met Tra-guy-kun
and came to Zou following the Vivre Card by chance,

854
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,970
and found the Road Poneglyph
which points the location of Raftel by by coincidence.

855
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,140
But according to Crocus-san
at the Twin Capes,

856
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,190
if you track logs,
every route will come to one in the end.

857
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,320
I'd always imagined that's Raftel.

858
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,350
Oh, Crocus!
I haven't seen him for a long time!

859
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,390
How is he doing?!

860
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,040
He was fine!
But that was two years ago!

861
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,350
You mean the old man who was with Laboon,
right?

862
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,540
Crocus the ship doctor! He-gara was looking for
some pirate group back in those days.

863
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,970
Oh, that was my group -
the whole crew is dead!

864
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,520
What?!

865
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,060
Hey! Listen!
I'm talking about something important!

866
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,310
Yes, I understand.

867
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,560
If you're interested where the logs will lead you,
go see for yourself.

868
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,200
There is definitely a route on which
all of those three needles point

869
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,030
in the same direction -
towards one specific place.

870
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,860
However, you-gara people have
already left on a journey

871
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,190
which lies beyond that point.

872
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,300
What? What do you mean?

873
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,560
You're supposed to find out about something
for the first time at the end of the route.

874
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,850
Find out the truth about
the Poneglyphs and the ancient script.

875
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,560
Find out about the civilization

876
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,550
that created those and the existence
of the hidden last island Raftel!

877
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,590
When Roger got there,
he had to do everything all over again.

878
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,700
Crocus was also part of the Pirate King's crew.
He is one of those who know everything.

879
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,720
He wouldn't tell a lie
unless he doesn't like you-gara guys.

880
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,890
I got it!

881
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,960
I didn't need to worry.
We weren't wandering off of the route.

882
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,530
I was just confused by the glimpses of the truth
we hadn't yet discovered.

883
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,120
The logs weren't lying!

884
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,750
Are you a navigator?
You're very dependable.

885
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,210
Don't worry! You're on the right track.

886
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,390
Just keep going!

887
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,620
Uh-huh!

888
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,650
Hey, hey! I don't know what
you guys are talking about

889
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,600
but don't you think our navigator's amazing?!

890
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,590
Am I dependable? Yes, I'm sure I am!

891
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,640
Yeah! The navigator of the next Pirate King!

892
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,520
How cool is that!

893
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,640
Don't hit me! That hurts!

894
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,590
Luffy...

895
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,330
It seems you-gara guys have been having fun
all this time.

896
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,700
Anyway, you guys are tied
to so many legends and

897
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,720
I feel dizzy like when I met Rayleigh.

898
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,700
I met Roger and the others too

899
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,300
but I don't remember clearly
because I was so young.

900
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Oh, so you don't remember clearly...

901
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,160
I mean, no way! Roger died
more than two decades ago!

902
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,650
Who are you talking about?!

903
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,150
So much happened on Oden-sama's journey.

904
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,860
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

905
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,340
But for now, we have so many things to do
before fighting Kaidou!

906
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,110
We need to prepare.

907
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,170
Like I told you before, we're
trying to recruit samurai

908
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,920
who will fight with us
in the Wano Country now!

909
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,180
In the meantime, we've got
someone we need to see!

910
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,700
It's always good to have more reinforcements.

911
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,490
Who is it?

912
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,390
He is the former 1st division commander of
the Whitebeard Pirates...

913
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,100
Marco the Phoenix!

914
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,610
Marco?

915
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,120
--I didn't expect to hear that name here.
--Marco... Marco...

916
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,790
Oh! So you guys are friendly with him!
That's good to know!

917
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,380
If he can back us up,
that's going to be a tremendous help!

918
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,220
No but wait a minute.
In the event a year ago, they...

919
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,830
Well, don't expect too much.

920
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,520
Even if we can find him,
there's only a little hope.

921
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,850
Marco... Marco...
I'm sure I know him...

922
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,840
You must've met him
in the Paramount War at Marineford!

923
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,330
Marco... Who was it?

924
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,580
They say he ate a very
rare type of Devil Fruit!

925
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,620
What? Rare?

926
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,790
He looks like a pineapple.

927
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,780
Oh, that guy!

928
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,340
It was a major clash between the

929
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,900
remnants of the Whitebeard
Pirates led by Marco

930
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,670
and the Blackbeard Pirates!

931
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,780
It's been a year since
the so-called Grudge War,

932
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,390
but we haven't heard about what happened to
the commanders yet.

933
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,750
If he's alive,
I think I know where he would be.

934
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,230
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Did they fight against Blackbeard?!

935
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,200
They did.

936
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,620
Both sides had reinforcements.
It was quite a large-scale battle.

937
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,720
And Marco and the others
suffered a crushing defeat.

938
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:29,060
Blackbeard came to be recognized
as one of the Four Emperors after the war.

939
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,600
I didn't know that.
Damn, Blackbeard!

940
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,660
That was a major incident!

941
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,980
You really have no idea about
what happened.

942
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,240
Jinbe told me.

943
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,740
In the Paramount War,

944
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,270
after I passed out,
the Whitebeard Pirates saved my life.

945
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,500
The war is not over yet!

946
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,880
Take Ace's brother with you, Jinbe!

947
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,440
I wanna see him again and thank him.

948
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,430
So just like Kin'emon,
we need time to prepare too.

949
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,940
Okay, got it!
Then, let's split up for now!

950
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,630
We will round up allies
and plot a strategy in the Wano Country.

951
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,630
Are you gonna be okay there?

952
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,700
I thought you guys are being
targeted by the shogun.

953
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,910
But we're worried about our comrades there.

954
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,470
If you come on our submarine,
you'll be safe while traveling.

955
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,080
And...

956
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,840
...if you know a place to hide
on the island, you'll be alright.

957
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,920
I'll go look for Marco with my subordinates.

958
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,970
If Kin'emon and the others
are headed there first,

959
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,200
we'd better meet up in the Wano Country.

960
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Let's make Kin'emon's Vivre Card.

961
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,080
Uh-huh, understood.

962
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,610
There he is! Raizo-dono!

963
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,310
Good to see you again!

964
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,320
What?

965
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,910
I'm glad that you're okay!

966
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,310
Raizo-san!

967
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,870
Y-You guys...?

968
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,900
Let's have a celebratory banquet.

969
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,750
It's ready!

970
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,680
A celebratory banquet?
What are we celebrating?!

971
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,230
Raizo-san's safety and...

972
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,280
The reconciliation of the two kings and...

973
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,900
The Kozuki Clan for reuniting safely!

974
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh my!

975
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,270
You damn Minks!

976
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,530
Sorry for locking you up!

977
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,950
We wanted to save you-gara
from Jack and the others!

978
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,330
Raizo-san!

979
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,000
We tied up your hands - did we hurt you?

980
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,300
Raizo-san!

981
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,420
Ninpo!

982
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,450
I-love-you Technique!

983
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,420
Raizo-dono!

984
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,410
Raizo-dono!

985
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,060
Nin! Nin! Nin! Nin!

986
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,070
All right! Let's have a banquet!

987
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,740
Banquet! Banquet! Banquet! Banquet! Banquet!

988
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,400
Banquet! Banquet!

989
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,580
Wait, Luffy!

990
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,790
We've already had a banquet!

991
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,710
Let's get going!
It's gonna be too late to save Sanji-kun!

992
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,780
What?! Are you coming?!

993
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,590
Of course, I'm coming with you!
I feel responsible.

994
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,500
Besides, do you think you can travel the sea

995
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,010
of the New World without a navigator?

996
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,980
I'm coming too! Pekoms is heavily injured!

997
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
Plus,

998
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,760
who is going to play music
when you guys feel down?

999
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:22,000
{\an8}Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

1000
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,000
Who needs that?

1001
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,730
Hey! Don't exclude me!

1002
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,760
We both allowed them to take Sanji-san!

1003
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,000
Kin'emon, do you mind if I take them with me?

1004
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,760
You don't need my permission!
They're your crew!

1005
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,520
And no one can stop someone
who is trying to save his friend!

1006
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,490
I wish I could come along!

1007
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,770
I'm in debt to Sanji-dono!

1008
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,610
I'm sorry!

1009
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,760
Now it's getting hard to sneak in.

1010
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,290
Get out of there as soon as
you screw up the wedding!

1011
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,040
We're gonna go along with Kin'emon
so you take care of Sanji!

1012
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,000
Uh-huh!

1013
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,970
Count on us!

1014
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,210
Oh, Luffy.

1015
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,710
In case you find a Poneglyph,
can you take a rubbing for me?

1016
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay!

1017
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,880
So light-hearted!

1018
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,300
I'll do research on the Poneglyph that Kaidou has
in the Wano Country too.

1019
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,850
Great!

1020
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,100
Alright! Is that all for now?

1021
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,320
Hm? What's wrong?

1022
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,850
What is it?!

1023
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Is that...

1024
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,410
What?! What?!

1025
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,180
The whole island is shaking!

1026
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,560
Zunesha is crying out!

1027
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,960
What's going on?!

1028
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,060
Who's Zunesha?!

1029
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,610
Huh? You're standing on it!

1030
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,070
Oh! It's the elephant's name!

1031
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,820
It's a big quake!
It's never happened before!

1032
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,670
Who is it?! Whose voice is that?!

1033
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,940
Run! It's gonna collapse!

1034
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,590
Strong Right!

1035
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,580
Get away from the building!

1036
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,740
--Hold onto the tree!
--Okay!

1037
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,530
This way!

1038
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,590
Hurry up now!

1039
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,120
Thank you!

1040
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,610
Who is it?! Who's talking?!

1041
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,560
My bone's gonna break, break, break!

1042
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,350
My bones go crack, crack, crack, crack!

1043
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,900
Momonosuke-sama! Are you hurt?!

1044
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,860
What's happening to Zunesha?!

1045
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,290
If you're there...

1046
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,290
Wh-Who is it?!

1047
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,130
--I hear the voice again!
--Momonosuke-sama!

1048
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,580
Luffy, what's wrong?!

1049
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,200
"What's wrong"?!
You hear it too, right?!

1050
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,510
Huh?! Hear what?!

1051
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,510
--No way!
--Can he-gara hear it too?!

1052
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,750
Hurry up!

1053
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,040
Who the hell are you?!

1054
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,770
It's the loudest ever!

1055
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,700
Fire!

1056
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,330
It's starting to work!

1057
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,920
No wonder.

1058
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,880
Normal elephants are panicked
by just one bee.

1059
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Take a good look at its body.

1060
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,600
If it's really been living for a millennium,
its skin must've gotten weak!

1061
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,020
Is it a living legend?
No! It's just an old animal!

1062
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,900
Concentrate fire on its left foreleg!

1063
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,740
More volleys!

1064
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,310
Keep shooting!

1065
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,000
If we can make it bend its knees
and it brings its face closer,

1066
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
we can finish it off as we like!

1067
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,800
I'd like to gouge its eyes out
and cut out its tongue!

1068
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,190
Maybe we can cut its stomach up from within!

1069
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,910
Hurry!

1070
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,580
Give me an order!

1071
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,300
If you are there!

1072
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,100
Give you an order to do what?!

1073
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,340
Answer me! Who are you?!

1074
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,000
We can't hear anything!

1075
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
I can only hear his voice!

1076
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,740
He's not listening to me!

1077
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,000
What do you mean?!

1078
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,480
What is going on?

1079
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,960
Gol D. Roger...

1080
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,200
And Oden-sama as well.

1081
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,920
I heard they experienced the same thing.

1082
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,660
They heard a loud voice, but they couldn't get it to respond.

1083
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,600
Momonosuke-sama! Momonosuke-sama!

1084
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,650
Momonosuke-sama!

1085
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,060
What is this?

1086
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,350
My head! My head... h-hurts!

1087
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,590
This is...!

1088
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,950
It's Jack!

1089
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,800
Jack is...

1090
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,680
Jack is attacking the elephant!

1091
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,920
There are five powerful-looking ships at nine o'clock!

1092
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,000
Zunesha is under attack?!

1093
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
As I thought, Jack wasn't dead.

1094
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,510
Momo! How do you know that?!

1095
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,800
I don't know... I just saw it!

1096
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,830
You saw?

1097
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:04,500
It... It came to my mind...

1098
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,790
I'm scared!

1099
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,460
Send out the ships!

1100
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,090
Return fire against Jack on the water!

1101
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,990
Okay!

1102
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,730
This is painful!

1103
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,190
If I collapse,

1104
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,160
it would put all of you in danger!

1105
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,260
The one behind the voice is...

1106
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,350
...this...

1107
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,720
...elephant!

1108
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,850
You mean Zunesha?!

1109
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,810
Momonosuke-sama! What's going on?!

1110
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,820
Again!

1111
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,740
A long time ago, I...

1112
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,420
A long time ago, the elephant committed a crime...

1113
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,730
And now... all he is allowed... to do is... walk.

1114
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,050
He has been... obeying that order.

1115
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,270
Thus...

1116
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,450
Shoot it up! Blow it away!

1117
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,460
Thus, give me permission for once!

1118
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,300
That worked! It's gonna collapse!

1119
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,010
Order me!

1120
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,320
To fight!

1121
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,340
Momo!

1122
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,070
You tell him! I have a feeling that your voice will reach him!

1123
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,040
But...

1124
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,250
If they bring down the elephant, we'll all end up in the sea!

1125
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,080
But how loud should I be...

1126
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,060
Just shout it out! Or the elephant will die!

1127
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,770
A little more to go!

1128
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,690
Don't give up, elephant! You can't fall down!

1129
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,630
Make Jack...

1130
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:34,140
Make Jack go away!!

1131
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,880
Understood!

1132
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,630
Trunk!

1133
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,100
Jack-sama, our ship has been thrown into the air!

1134
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,850
Oh...

1135
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,480
Oh no-saru!

1136
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,180
It quieted down.

1137
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,810
What happened?!

1138
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,530
I don't know. I don't see anything or hear the voice now.

1139
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,540
Oh, really?! So Zunesha used his own trunk?

1140
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,750
That's right-saru! With a single blow!

1141
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,500
I can't believe it. I'd never thought Zunesha had a mind of his own.

1142
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,470
Furthermore, we can even communicate with him.

1143
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,420
Did Oden-sama know about Momonosuke-sama's ability?

1144
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,130
Hey!

1145
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,690
What's wrong? You guys still look serious.

1146
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,980
We're stunned at this sudden occurrence.

1147
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,940
First, we gotta find out how Jack was able to get here.

1148
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,900
Otherwise, this place will no longer be safe.

1149
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,990
I see. Well, good luck with that.
It'd be cool if this elephant becomes our ally.

1150
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,870
That's easy for you to say.

1151
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:02,080
Now, we're gonna go, so can we have lots of food?!

1152
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,000
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1153
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,060
Ring, ring, ring...

1154
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,020
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1155
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,010
Clank.

1156
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,190
What do you want?

1157
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,240
They say that communication with Jack has been suddenly lost!

1158
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,150
Kaidou-san!

1159
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:01,000
The medical knowledge of the now-named Sakura Kingdom
and the pharmaceutical knowledge of the Birdie Kingdom.

1160
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,980
It's really incredible!

1161
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,490
The bleeding has stopped.

1162
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,500
You did great!

1163
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,320
I prepared more than enough medicine,
so you'll be okay!

1164
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,510
Only Dr. Chopper could've done it!

1165
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,160
It's really amazing!

1166
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,990
S-Such compliments...

1167
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,530
...don't make me happy,
you fools!

1168
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,480
Like you taught us,

1169
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,300
we'll try to remove the bandages on a regular basis
to see how the wound is.

1170
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,460
Good.
But even just changing the bandages is painstaking.

1171
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,020
We'll be careful.

1172
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,250
Yeah! Leave it to us!

1173
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,610
Zunesha is our millennium-old land!

1174
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,660
We might've gotten too comfortable and forgotten about it
because it's always been there since we were born.

1175
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,160
Today, we were reminded.

1176
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:10,210
We were reminded that we're always kept alive
by this great lifeform.

1177
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,510
And it will come to an end one day.

1178
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:22,440
If Zunesha, our land, has free will,

1179
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,560
I want to ask him this now.

1180
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:36,610
"You have been walking for a thousand years.
Where are you heading?"

1181
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,680
Mokomo Dukedom, Kurau City

1182
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,600
You want to stay? Here in Zou?

1183
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,500
Uh-huh.

1184
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,580
What are you going to do here?

1185
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,670
I actually don't know what to do but...

1186
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,430
Understood!

1187
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,020
If it's possible,
I want to talk with him once again!

1188
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,020
With Zunesha!

1189
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,020
With the one who has been living for a millennium!

1190
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,450
Why could he hear my voice?

1191
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,080
Maybe he knows something about the Kozuki Clan!

1192
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,830
--What?
--Momonosuke-sama!

1193
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,290
I understand but there are people waiting for us
in the Wano Country...

1194
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,340
That's all right, Kin'emon.

1195
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:41,600
I've been thinking I still have to
protect this country from the threat of Kaidou.

1196
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:48,850
We don't know yet how Jack could make it here twice
so we mustn't let down our guard.

1197
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,820
We can't all get into the Wano Country
at once anyway.

1198
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,600
I think I'll stay here for a while.

1199
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,950
I'll bring Momonosuke-sama with me later.

1200
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,890
Understood.

1201
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,930
Nekomamushi made my Vivre Card earlier.

1202
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,120
Give this to everyone.

1203
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,040
Now, let's split up into four groups.

1204
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Search for Marco

1205
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Wano Country

1206
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Zou

1207
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Whole Cake Island

1208
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Team Nekomamushi

1209
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Team Kin'emon

1210
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Team Inuarashi

1211
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,230
Team Luffy

1212
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,410
You can get there by following the Vivre Card,

1213
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,360
but the problem is how we communicate.

1214
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,400
In other countries, they use a snail to...

1215
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,940
I mean, it's this big and if you speak into it,
someone at a distance will...

1216
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,940
--Oh, you mean the Transponder Snail.
--Oh, that.

1217
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,160
But in this country,
we're not accustomed to using them.

1218
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,990
If you want a Transponder Snail,
I saw a wild one in the forest.

1219
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,900
If you want one, I can set it up for you.
It's easy.

1220
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,460
What??

1221
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,080
Whale Forest

1222
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,080
Hey!

1223
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,440
The outskirts of the Guardians' dwelling

1224
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,880
Hey!

1225
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,270
Pekomamushi's house is collapsed!

1226
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,840
Hey, Pekomamushi!

1227
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,100
Are you okay?! Answer me!

1228
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,900
Pekomamushi! Where are you?!

1229
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm here! Grr!

1230
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
Where are you?!

1231
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,330
Look down!

1232
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,860
A turtle?!

1233
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,530
Step back!

1234
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,170
How can I get a good rest?! Grr!

1235
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,080
So you're Turtle-Mamushi!

1236
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,460
Okay, so not only do you not remember my name,
but you also forgot that I'm a lion! Grr!

1237
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,000
Of course, I could survive!
I ate the Turtle Fruit!

1238
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,300
And my shell is as hard as a diamond!

1239
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,500
Why aren't you listening?!

1240
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,180
Chopper said he'll take responsibility
for treating you.

1241
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,940
I see! You're not gonna
respond to the diamond part? Grr!

1242
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,540
Ow, ow, ow!

1243
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,990
But I appreciate his care.

1244
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,320
I owe you guys a lot.

1245
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,950
What?

1246
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,500
What?!!

1247
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,530
So let's go see Big Mom!

1248
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,170
What?!

1249
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,300
Wait, you bastard!

1250
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,470
Don't you get it? I'm fatally injured now!

1251
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,200
Hey! I'm injured! You've got to stop...

1252
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,690
It's insane! I can't believe this!

1253
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,070
You're the worst person to have debts to!

1254
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,770
Guardians' Residential
District

1255
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,560
Master.

1256
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,880
Pedro.

1257
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,990
Sanji saved this country.

1258
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,120
And he was kidnapped in this country.

1259
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,880
Even though the team has to be small,
we will fail in our duty...

1260
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,050
...if no one from the Mink Tribe other than Pekoms
accompanies them.

1261
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,300
You-gara, do you want to go along with Luffy?

1262
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,530
I do!

1263
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,180
Don't try to get the jump on the rest, Pedro!

1264
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,870
That is a role that...

1265
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,070
...we the Three Inuarashi Musketeers are
prepared to take on!

1266
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,530
Back off, Shishilian!

1267
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,940
A noisy guy like you is the least suitable for the job!

1268
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,290
I'm not noisy!

1269
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:41,040
Let me go!
I was with the Straw Hats the whole time!

1270
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,340
Let me go too as an assistant to Dr. Chopper!

1271
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,850
Wanda! Tristan!

1272
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,890
We befriended Luffy after we fought him,
Pedro-san!

1273
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,720
BB! Roddy!

1274
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,610
Nami likes to sleep on my stomach!

1275
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,770
That won't do them any good, Pastor Yomo!

1276
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,870
I wanna chew on Baron Corpse's bones forever!

1277
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,890
--Me too!
--Me too!

1278
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,320
That's just your own goal! Shut up, dogs!

1279
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,370
I understand how you all feel!

1280
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,600
But you have to...

1281
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,620
...let Pedro handle it!

1282
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,960
Why, Master?!

1283
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,150
Because Pekoms will be there.

1284
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,550
Only Pedro can get him-gara under control!

1285
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,740
Something is going on over there.

1286
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,820
I called the last one "perfect" but...

1287
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,150
...the new one surpasses that easily!

1288
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,410
I incorporated
the growth capability of Pop Green

1289
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,490
and got Franky's help
for the surface treatment.

1290
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,830
It's not too much to say
that it's the greatest invention of the century...

1291
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,750
You listening, Nami?!

1292
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,960
If I squeeze here...

1293
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,850
That was close!

1294
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,290
It's a little too long, Usopp!

1295
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:29,150
Listen to my instruction! You extended it too far!
You need some practice!

1296
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:35,620
That's a new Climate Baton which you can extend
as you like with slight variations in handling!

1297
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,670
I see!

1298
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,380
I incorporated all the gadgets from Weatheria
that I got from you at Sabaody.

1299
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,850
But just one thing...

1300
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,580
You said to me at Sabaody...

1301
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,460
It's like a magic wand!

1302
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,020
I didn't understand what it meant.

1303
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,300
It fits to my hand! It's easy to twirl!

1304
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,410
--So it's up to you to decide.
--This is great, Usopp!

1305
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,110
Wh-Wh-Wh...
What an advanced ninjutsu that is!

1306
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,650
It's nice!

1307
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,100
This sure is the culmination of
Weatheria's science of weather!

1308
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,620
The Sorcerer's Climate Baton that I wanted!

1309
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,590
Thanks, Usopp!

1310
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,000
Don't mention it!

1311
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,340
Now, about the cost...

1312
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,970
Mirage Tempo!

1313
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,060
Don't try to run!

1314
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,660
The main gate of Zou

1315
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,240
In the end, it's the six of us.

1316
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,700
It's nice to have you, Peropero!

1317
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,660
It's Pedro. I won't bother you.

1318
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,110
Wh-Why's Big Bro Pedro coming, Grr?

1319
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,070
I'll come along as someone who's known you-gara well
for a long time.

1320
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,550
What do you mean by that?! Grr!

1321
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,820
Nami! Take care!

1322
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,220
Thanks! You too, Wanda!

1323
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,750
Take care, Dr. Chopper.

1324
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,800
Listen. We know him.

1325
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,500
He could be dancing around like that
being happy about his marriage.

1326
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,560
No way!

1327
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,600
But I can't deny it!

1328
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,440
Well, it's gonna be okay!

1329
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,820
Alright, Luffy-dono!
We'll be waiting for you in the Wano Country!

1330
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,660
Good luck, Luffy!

1331
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,900
Take care!

1332
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,050
Let us know if something happens.

1333
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,800
I'll make a weapon to destroy Kaidou!

1334
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,000
I'll round up the samurai in the Wano Country!

1335
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,670
Now, I'll help you descend from the elephant.

1336
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,260
That's okay, Kanjurou!

1337
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,310
Bye!

1338
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,390
Ya-hoo!

1339
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,620
Leave Sanji in our hands!

1340
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,170
What?!

1341
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,520
See you in the Wano Country!

1342
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,160
--Okay!
--Don't get caught by Big Mom!

1343
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,630
She's the emperor of the sea!

1344
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,770
Yeah! See you!

1345
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,500
{\an8}Thus, the Sanji retrieval team led by Luffy...

1346
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,150
{\an8}...sets out for the Whole Cake Island
where Emperor Big Mom, who Luffy picked a fight with, waits.

1347
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,610
{\an8}Meanwhile, at the desert kingdom Alabasta
in the Grand Line...

1348
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,160
Father-sama, hurry up!

1349
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,700
Wait, Vivi.
Why are you in such a good mood?

1350
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,930
Because it's been a while
since I went out to sea!

1351
