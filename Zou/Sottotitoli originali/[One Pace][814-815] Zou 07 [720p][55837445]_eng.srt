780
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

781
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

782
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

783
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}

784
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}yes

785
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}we

786
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}can!

787
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

788
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

789
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

790
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

791
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

792
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

793
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

794
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

795
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,230
Master Nekomamushi!

796
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,790
He's a wonderful person!

797
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,430
I like him so much, so I wrote a song about him.

798
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,910
Let's Go See Master Nekomamushi

799
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:05,170
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

800
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:14,530
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

801
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:23,700
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

802
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

803
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:46,550
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

804
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:55,120
Let's go and meet Master Nekomamushi

805
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,490
Nami. I don't see Sanji or Cedar.

806
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,900
Don't tell me they were taken away...

807
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,610
No, he went willingly.

808
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,170
What?

809
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,970
Wanda! Carrot!

810
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,210
They-gara want you to forget about it.
You must understand.

811
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,820
We'll take care of Pekoms too.

812
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,890
Don't give the daytime people unnecessary anxiety.

813
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,640
Thank you, Master.

814
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,410
You-gara guys showed concern for our broken-hearted citizens.

815
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,330
We should thank you.

816
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,640
There's silver vine!

817
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:58,250
Master Nekomamushi gets lonely easily

818
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:07,920
When I think of him like that it makes my heart twinge

819
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,430
When he is bathed in the moonlight his face looks innocent

820
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:26,360
He gazes up at it with his sparkling eyes

821
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:39,940
But he tries to act tough under the sun

822
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:48,800
He does his best and lives his life on his own

823
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,270
I like that song.

824
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,920
Is Master Nekomamushi really like that?

825
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,440
Not at all.

826
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,870
He's not?!

827
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,610
It's just a song inspired by him.

828
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,020
Then, "gotta go see a woman" means...

829
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,790
...he's gonna get married?

830
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,760
That's not necessarily the case but...

831
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,200
...it seemed like he was determined.

832
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,920
Oh, maybe he'll return with his wife.

833
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,050
What?!

834
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,140
In that case, we'll get a new member!

835
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,820
Luffy-san.

836
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,180
The bride is the Emperor's daughter.

837
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,880
That means we'll become Big Mom's subordinates.

838
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,450
No!

839
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,670
Of course, Sanji-san doesn't want that either.

840
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,550
He refused it firmly right there.

841
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,540
But that troubles me.

842
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,910
Considering who he is dealing with this time,
if he couldn't avoid the marriage,

843
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,730
what do you think he would do?

844
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,470
Well, he would...

845
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,320
Yeah, he's the kind of guy who'll try not to cause us any trouble...

846
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,980
So he'd try to separate himself from us!

847
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,880
You mean Sanji will quit this group?!

848
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,150
That's even more unacceptable!

849
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,850
When he tossed us out, he could've gotten away too.

850
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:28,100
When he wrote the note, I think he'd already made up his mind to go by himself.

851
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,680
Big Mom's daughter, huh?

852
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,160
He got a pretty troublesome offer of marriage.

853
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,210
And did you say Vinsmoke?
I guess that family is the key.

854
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,860
It could be Sanji's father or mother or brother...

855
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,070
They once lived in the North Blue and then moved to the East Blue and now, they're in the New World.

856
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,160
Unbelievable!

857
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,790
Vinsmoke...

858
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,560
I think I've heard of them before...

859
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,530
We're sorry.

860
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,510
I wish we could've stopped him at least until you guys arrived...

861
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,950
Sanji wouldn't let you stop him.
It's not your fault, guys.

862
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,950
But, Robin,
what if we never get to see him again?!

863
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,980
Nothing wrong with that.

864
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,790
Huh?!

865
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,700
I mean, if he was leaving for good,

866
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,660
he should've said
"Thank you for everything."

867
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,800
And "I'm sorry for causing so much trouble."

868
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,170
No, that's not the point!

869
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,340
Think about it.
We're on an unstoppable train now.

870
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,170
Remember what Caesar said?

871
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:51,740
The biggest customer of SMILEs,
the artificial Devil Fruits, is Kaidou.

872
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,310
We pissed Doflamingo off
by destroying the lab on Punk Hazard,

873
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,950
we destroyed the SMILE factory in Dressrosa,

874
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,760
and the man who's gonna go nuts next is...

875
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,610
...Emperor Kaidou!

876
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,070
He's not some distant threat anymore.

877
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,080
We've already had a fight with his subordinates,
the Beast Pirates.

878
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,620
Jack who ruined this country, and others will
come after us in a matter of time!

879
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,080
We're allying with Tra-guy for upcoming battles.

880
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,410
I don't know why but it seems like Kin'emon and the others are targeted by Kaidou too.

881
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,430
We'll face Emperor Kaidou very soon!

882
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,640
How stupid can he be to get involved with another Emperor, Big Mom, now?!

883
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,670
That twirly-eyebrowed fool!

884
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,550
Don't say it like that!

885
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,250
You boorish son of a gun!
Those things are unrelated!

886
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,890
First of all, how could he get wrapped up in
such a thing as marriage?! It's such a small deal!

887
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,200
What did you say?!

888
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,090
Both of you! Don't get so heated up!

889
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,440
It is a big deal!

890
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,740
You can't say someone else's problem is big or small!

891
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,330
What?!

892
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,070
All right!

893
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,510
We don't know what's on his mind
so let's go ask him!

894
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,070
Huh?

895
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,720
What?!

896
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,550
Hey! Forget it, Luffy!

897
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,620
Don't tell me we're gonna head for Big Mom!

898
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,750
I guess so.

899
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,350
Did you forget that you picked a fight with her?!

900
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,130
Without a strategy or reinforcements,
we'll just get beaten and that'll be it!

901
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,590
She's an Emperor.

902
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,370
Luffy! Don't forget. She's on a totally different level than any of our past enemies.

903
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,400
Then, we'll go quietly.

904
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,540
How do we find them?!

905
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,570
Well, there is a way to go after them but...

906
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,780
He's right.

907
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,850
Sanji-san has gone because of the Big Mom Pirates...

908
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,420
But they left something big behind instead.

909
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,460
If that person is awake now,
there should be something he can tell us.

910
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,400
Let's just keep going.

911
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,620
This place has been totally wrecked.

912
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,130
Whale Forest
Dwelling of the Guardians

913
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,150
The Whale Tree looks even bigger up close!

914
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,250
Hey, guys!

915
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,480
It's the Straw Hats!

916
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,090
Chopper is here!

917
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,170
Garchu!

918
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,830
Garchu!

919
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,340
Garchu!

920
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,080
Garchu!

921
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,520
The Minks are recovering fast, aren't they?

922
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,170
You're right.

923
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,190
Straw Hat Luffy!

924
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,370
It's us!

925
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,830
Sorry for what we did in the forest.

926
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,450
Doesn't matter who it is,
we can't let any invader get by!

927
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,680
Oh, it's you guys!

928
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Well, never mind!

929
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,290
Um, where's Nekomamushi?

930
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm glad to see you!

931
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,610
Our saviors and their friends!

932
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,020
Let me say it once again.

933
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,800
Thank you!

934
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,030
Who is this?!

935
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,810
Captain of the Whale Forest Guardians
(Jaguar Mink)
Treetop Pedro

936
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,950
Sorry for my subordinates' action in the forest.

937
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,040
They were too wary of invaders.

938
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
Were you there?

939
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
Yes, I was up in a tree.

940
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,850
Bepo and the others are waiting for you-gara guys back there.

941
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,350
We can see them later.

942
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,720
We wanna see Master Nekomamushi and Pekomamushi the lion first.

943
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,820
Garchu!

944
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,610
If you're talking about Pekoms, he's up now.
He's in the building at the back.

945
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,450
We kept the whole incident secret from everybody.

946
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,240
Sanji is a nice guy.

947
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,670
I hope we can help you in some way.

948
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,900
Luffy! I'm worried about Nakomamushi; not just about his condition,

949
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,460
so I'll go see him first!

950
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,210
Okay!

951
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,820
Then, let me lead the way, Dr. Chopper.

952
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,100
Hey, Chopper! Why are you frozen?

953
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,280
I-I-I'm not frozen.

954
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,240
You're acting strange.

955
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,670
It's this way.

956
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,740
O-Okay!

957
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,800
Master Nekomamushi is taking a bath now.

958
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,020
A bath?!

959
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,840
SAKE

960
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,070
PROTECT

961
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,170
PROTECT

962
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:31,300
PROTECT

963
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,440
PROTECT

964
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,550
PROTECT

965
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,650
PROTECT

966
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:31,770
PROTECT

967
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,910
Lasagna!

968
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,360
It's good-meow! Yeah!

969
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey, Nekomamushi!

970
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,170
You shouldn't take a bath!
Your wound is gonna reopen!

971
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,440
And you should eat light meals!

972
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,310
Why are you using your left hand?!

973
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,110
Are you listening to me?!

974
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,960
Oh, Chopper!

975
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,090
No problem. No problem!

976
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,610
I'm a freedom-loving man!

977
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,260
You have to listen to your doctor!

978
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,790
He's larger than I expected.

979
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm sorry but even if it's a doctor's instruction...

980
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,140
Whoops...

981
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,130
I don't care!

982
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,200
I still can't get used to not having a left hand!

983
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,500
I can't even clap my hands like this!

984
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,490
So you-gara people are the Straw Hats!

985
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,380
You saved me!

986
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,640
Thank you!

987
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll repay my debt to you someday!

988
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,060
I may not look it but
I have a strong sense of obligation and compassion!

989
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,170
Oh, a ball.

990
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,240
Yeah! A ball!

991
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,050
I told you to rest!

992
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,990
See! The wound reopened!

993
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,860
Listen, I...

994
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,770
I got into bed because I wanted to.

995
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,640
Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay.

996
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,670
Whatever the case, just stay still!

997
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,670
I'm gonna give you a shot.

998
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,680
Hey, you-gara!

999
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,140
Show me that foxtail right there.

1000
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,020
Like this?

1001
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,630
Chopper!
Hurry up while I'm distracted and enjoying myself!

1002
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,060
I told you to stay still!

1003
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,560
Are you afraid of shots?!
Even looking like that?!

1004
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,740
It's completely cured now.

1005
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,010
There's no wonder drug like that so keep quiet!

1006
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,280
Don't hit an injured person.

1007
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,820
Boy, he's so funny!

1008
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,650
I love him!

1009
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,560
I can't believe you survived!

1010
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,600
I blocked about half of the attack
with my ability! Grr!

1011
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,770
Bege, that bastard!

1012
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm sorry.
They must've taken Black-Leg with them.

1013
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,810
He can't get away from the wedding now!

1014
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,930
Yeah, about that, Pekomamushi...

1015
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,520
Who arranged the marriage?

1016
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:48,090
Well, of course, our Mama and the father of the Vinsmoke Family!

1017
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,350
Sanji-kun's father?!

1018
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,590
What kind of person is he?!

1019
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,560
He's quite infamous in the underworld.

1020
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,190
Have you ever heard the name, Germa 66?

1021
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,430
Also known as the Warmongers.

1022
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,930
What are you talking about?!

1023
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,870
That's a mythical evil army!

1024
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,110
How ridiculous!

1025
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,150
No, it's an actual organization.

1026
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,050
The Vinsmoke Family is at the top of it!

1027
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,540
And their boss is Black-Leg's father!

1028
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,060
Believe this if nothing else.

1029
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,480
I didn't mean to hide anything from my friends.

1030
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,470
The Vinsmoke Family is, well, to put it simply...

1031
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,610
A family of assassins!

1032
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,220
Sanji-kun is from a family of assassins?!

1033
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,580
I don't know what you're talking about and I don't care!

1034
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,530
Grr! I'm sure you don't!

1035
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,160
What we wanna know is
whether he'll come back or not!

1036
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
He can get married if he wants!

1037
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,800
But we don't wanna become Big Mom's subordinates because of it!

1038
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,740
So if they get married,
you guys become my subordinates!

1039
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,250
Ouch!

1040
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,500
Pekoms, are you okay?

1041
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,730
Luffy, you're funny!

1042
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,170
Watch what you say, you brat!
Or I'll destroy you!

1043
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,070
Grr!

1044
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,340
I owe you guys but don't push your luck!

1045
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,480
Mama is one of the Four Emperors of the sea!

1046
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,940
Uh-huh.

1047
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,310
This is bad for my wound.

1048
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,780
You have pretty eyes.

1049
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,320
Shut up!

1050
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,890
Well, either way,
he can't escape the marriage.

1051
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,170
Why?!

1052
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,860
Just like Black-Leg has gone to attend it,

1053
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,110
no one can turn down an invitation
to Mama's tea party on any account.

1054
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:29,050
If anybody turns it down, they'll get themselves quite a shocking present.

1055
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,020
Because they put Mama to shame.

1056
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,850
It's not the kind of present you want.

1057
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,560
Inside they would receive the decapitated head of a person who was close to them!

1058
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,330
It could be a head of someone
from the Straw Hats...

1059
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,140
...or someone from the restaurant
in the East Blue.

1060
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,950
Oh, it could be someone from the Kamabakka Kingdom.

1061
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,480
Hey!
How do you guys know about all those things?!

1062
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,260
That's what power can do, Straw Hat!

1063
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,760
What he was told at that
time must have been...

1064
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,600
When someone as powerful as that makes a threat, it's definitely not idle.

1065
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,340
Who can fight it?

1066
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,780
That's how powerful the Four Emperors are!

1067
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,950
There's really nothing you can do about it!

1068
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,690
That's why Sanji-kun had no choice but to go!

1069
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,520
There's one other thing.
Let me ease your worry, my saviors.

1070
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,530
You guys will not become
her subordinates. Grr!

1071
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,600
It's a political marriage.

1072
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,270
Mama always forms a connection with those who'll become her subordinates.

1073
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,350
So this marriage is a ritual

1074
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,800
to form a connection between the Vinsmoke Family and the Charlotte Family.

1075
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,150
It's got nothing to do with you guys.

1076
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,290
Do you want me to break it down for you more?

1077
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,770
From the moment they get married,

1078
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,670
Black-Leg Sanji will no longer
be part of your crew!

1079
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,590
What?!

1080
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,410
That's totally unacceptable!
Sanji's my friend!

1081
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,680
But he's Vinsmoke's son first!

1082
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,550
Don't get mad at me! Grr!

1083
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,570
I know Sanji will refuse such a marriage!

1084
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,070
In the face of Mama and the vicious Vinsmoke Family?

1085
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,030
Well, I wonder if he can manage to stay alive after he refuses.

1086
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,800
What do you mean?!

1087
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,900
Hey, Pekomamushi!
What are you gonna do now?!

1088
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,220
I'll go back to Mama after I get well.

1089
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,280
That bastard Bege thinks he killed me!

1090
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,110
But he can't get away with it!

1091
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,010
Then, take me with you!

1092
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,210
Luffy!

1093
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,320
Nami, I'm gonna go by myself.

1094
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,150
What?

1095
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,990
Like Robin and the others said, if we go together, it'd seem like we want a war.

1096
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,390
We don't have time for that.

1097
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,910
I'll go by myself!

1098
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,220
If I go with him, maybe I can sneak into the tea party and ruin the wedding.

1099
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,040
Screw you!
Are you asking me to harbor an enemy?!

1100
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,380
Oh, sounds like fun!

1101
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,020
Carrot, this is serious!

1102
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,800
Okay, it's a deal!

1103
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,520
H-Hey!

1104
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,220
Ouch!

1105
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,720
I'll get Chopper! Get well already!

1106
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,360
Don't just decide that!

1107
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,360
Ow, ow... Hey!

1108
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,130
Wait, Straw Hat!

1109
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,130
Zoro, you're here!
Did you hear all that?!

1110
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,200
Just barely.

1111
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,140
You're worried about Sanji, aren't you?

1112
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,760
I'll kick you, fool!
I told you to forget about that idiot!

1113
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,590
Hey!

1114
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,780
Luffy! Zoro! How's Pekoms doing?!

1115
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,540
Oh, Chopper!

1116
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,590
He's crying from pain and banging his head against a wall and yelling!

1117
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,590
Cure him now!

1118
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,330
Those are crazy symptoms!
I'll check him right away!

1119
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,870
Garchu! Baron Corpe!

1120
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,540
Oh! You-gara are Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?!
I couldn't wait to meet you!

1121
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,980
What?! Why did you follow us?! Get rest!

1122
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,480
I just got better!

1123
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,820
No, you didn't!

1124
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,050
He's huge! Is that Nekomamushi?!
He's a cat monster!

1125
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,900
A Garchu of thanks!

1126
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,750
Nekomamushi is spouting blood!

1127
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,380
Hey, what are you doing, cat monster!?

1128
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,690
Stay with me! Nekomamushi!

1129
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,570
What's going on?

1130
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,300
I'm out of blood!
Bring me some blood quick!

1131
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,270
Okay, Dr. Chopper.

1132
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,310
Th-Th-Th-Thank...

1133
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,380
What's wrong, Chopper?!

1134
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,940
Cat monster, stand up! I'll cut you up!

1135
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,840
Whoa-whoa, he's injured.

1136
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,640
Oh, Tra-guy!

1137
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,820
Oh! Are they your friends?!

1138
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,780
Yeah, I came to introduce them to you.
They're my crew; 20 in total!

1139
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,260
It's nice to make your acquaintance! Straw Hat!

1140
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,260
Heart Pirates

1141
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,390
Yeah!

1142
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,900
We need to talk.

1143
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,530
What?! Is that it?!

1144
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,130
Heartless! Heartless!

1145
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,910
Heartless! Heartless! Heartless! Heartless! Heartless!

1146
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,910
We feel slighted, Captain!

1147
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,410
We're just allies.
We don't necessarily have to get friendly.

1148
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,550
Help me...

1149
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,220
What?! Black-Foot-ya went to Big Mom?!

1150
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,450
Uh-huh.

1151
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,100
How in the world could that happen?!

1152
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,330
Don't worry!
I'm gonna go take him back!

1153
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,630
So could you wait to fight
Kaidou a little bit?!

1154
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,800
That's not my call!

1155
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,000
It's only a matter of time
before Kaidou comes after us!

1156
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,580
I thought we could hide ourselves here in Zou for a while but they know where it is.

1157
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,460
Even if their target is us next, what do you think will happen to this country if it's attacked again?!

1158
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,260
How kind of you!

1159
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,730
Since when were they there?!

1160
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,450
Garchu!

1161
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,100
You-gara guys, are you really pirates?!

1162
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,970
Thank you for caring about us
on top of saving us!

1163
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,970
Thank you! Garchu!

1164
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,670
Oh, Pekoms, are you hurt?

1165
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,050
Yeah...

1166
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,880
Well, who cares!

1167
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,640
Okay, let's have a banquet!

1168
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,020
Bring drinks and food!

1169
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,320
Why, Nekomamushi?!

1170
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,920
I'm in!

1171
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,050
No you're not!{Would "No you're not!" or "Don't be!" be better?}

1172
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,270
Seems like Luffy-san and the others are completely forgetting about it.

1173
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,580
But we mature adults must get our act together.

1174
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,540
That's right.
This country doesn't want them.

1175
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,160
Yeah! Under no circumstances should a samurai enter!

1176
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,890
After all, Raizo-san, the person Kin'emon-san and

1177
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,450
Kanjurou-san are looking for, isn't here so there's no point to enter.

1178
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,660
In addition, because of that,

1179
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,290
the millennium-old city was ruined!

1180
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,900
Bring Raizo here!

1181
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,000
Where's the warrior from the Land of Wano?

1182
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,520
They call us saviors and thank us.

1183
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,350
So we absolutely can't tell them
that we actually have some samurai friends.

1184
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,360
If they find out that Kin'emon and the others were going to use this island as their rendezvous point...

1185
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,880
Even the cheerful Minks would be pissed off.

1186
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,440
I don't wanna fight them
after we got to know each other!

1187
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,410
Let's keep guard all night long
to prevent Kin'emon and Kanjurou from entering.

1188
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,360
The next morning

1189
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,360
Well... Well, well, well,
it's still dark so it's before dawn.

1190
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,890
We made it!

1191
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,040
That's right! We finally made it!

1192
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,680
Oh boy, it was a disaster,
but all's well that ends well.

1193
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,970
I'm sure Luffy-dono and everybody are worried about us.

1194
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,330
I feel bad.

1195
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,750
Yes, they must've been waiting for us!

1196
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,370
Well done, Torasaburo.

1197
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,770
Tora-?!
Oh, I didn't know this animal was a tiger!

1198
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,770
{\an8}Note: tora = tiger

1199
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,480
Alright, that's enough.
Revert to a painting!

1200
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,370
But monkey fellow,
you didn't tell us anything after all.

1201
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,390
I just wanna know
if a warrior named Raizo is...

1202
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,850
I-I don't know anything-saru!

1203
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,800
What's the matter? You look pale...

1204
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,900
Oh, hey, wait! Where are you going?!

1205
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,490
We can't look for Raizo on our own!

1206
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,900
Wait, monkey fellow!
We need you to take us around!

1207
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,450
Oh no-saru! Samurai are here-saru!

1208
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,780
I gotta let them know as soon as possible!

1209
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,650
Samurai are here-saru!
