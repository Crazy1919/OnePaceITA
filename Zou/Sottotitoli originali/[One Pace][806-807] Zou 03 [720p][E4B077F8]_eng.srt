780
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,480
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,870
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,140
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}

800
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,710
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,890
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,590
At Rightflank Fortress

812
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,240
Here comes a Rain-Ruption!

813
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,780
What?!

814
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,330
A big splash of water?!

815
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,860
It'll cause floods!

816
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,770
Get to high ground!

817
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,080
Run!

818
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,450
But...

819
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,780
It's too late!

820
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,540
{\an8}Meanwhile, Kin'emon and Kanjuro are
climbing the elephant's left leg...

821
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,000
Finally, it stopped.

822
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,770
What was the shaking all about?

823
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,980
I don't know.

824
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,400
But we're coming to the crucial point.

825
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,970
Hold on, cat! Nekozaemon!

826
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,460
Now hurry up!

827
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,400
The sun is setting, Nekozaemon!

828
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,420
Isn't it too much for a cat to climb this elephant?

829
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,320
Kanjuro!

830
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
No, it's not.

831
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,460
Cats are good tree climbers.

832
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,620
They are!

833
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,560
Water?!

834
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,300
What?!

835
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,910
Oh, that's water overflowing from a Rain-Ruption that poured over the country...

836
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,900
Water is no good! It will melt Nekozaemon!

837
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,820
There is no time to lose...
But again, halfway to the top, we...

838
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,280
The Whale Forest - Luffy's Group

839
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,290
Oh, that was a hell of a rain!

840
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,960
Rain-Ruptions aren't actually a type of rain.

841
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Huh?

842
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,170
Twice a day, Zunesha sprays water on itself.

843
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,640
So that was a blast of seawater.

844
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,150
The water passes through a filtration system at the center of the city to aqueducts

845
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,020
and becomes the drinking water for the whole nation.

846
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,120
Fish fall along with the seawater, so we never run out of food.

847
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,420
Rain-Ruptions provide us with a lot.

848
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,830
Hey, Straw Hat!

849
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,550
Oh, the bear!

850
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,710
I can't leave this forest, so can you tell our captain about us and bring him here?!

851
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh, you can't?

852
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,540
Okay!

853
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,780
I'm counting on you!

854
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,540
Bepo was born here, but since he's a pirate,

855
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,520
he's now under the care of Master Nekomamushi, the boss of the forest.

856
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,420
Kurau City - Zoro and the others

857
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,780
It's flooding!

858
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,400
There's a shark! A shark?! Why?!

859
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
You went way too high!

860
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,880
This is high enough.

861
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Seawater?

862
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,780
Maybe, that was the giant elephant spraying water on itself.

863
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,950
It seems like both the town and the forest are adapted to this water level.

864
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,440
Well, seeing the water amount...
I guess you're right!

865
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,830
That means this happens every day...

866
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,050
I wouldn't want that tremendous downpour every day!

867
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,210
We must find everybody quickly and get off of this annoying island!

868
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Hey, there's Luffy!
At the edge of the town!

869
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,250
He's with the Nami-dog girl and the jump rabbit from before!

870
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,920
He's being fooled and is being taken to their lair...

871
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,540
What is it, Usopp?!

872
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,430
Luffy's been bitten!

873
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,200
What?! So they're really...

874
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
The water will drain away soon.

875
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,140
I know he's here!

876
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,780
I told you he's not!

877
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,660
Bring him here
or this country will be destroyed!

878
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I don't know what you're talking about!

879
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,120
I really don't know!

880
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,270
What else can I say?!

881
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,570
Who was it?

882
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,200
You told me the name of the guy who attacked this country before.

883
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
His name is Jack.

884
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,640
I saw his obituary in the newspaper a few days ago.

885
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,550
It said, after he overran this country,

886
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,260
he attacked four Navy ships that were transporting Doflamingo

887
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,520
and sank two of them but they struck back.

888
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,590
What?! Was he there at Dressrosa?!

889
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,970
He attacked the ships with the Navy admiral and the former fleet admiral on board.

890
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,400
He must have a screw loose.

891
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,660
It said his death wasn't confirmed.

892
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,720
I think he's still alive.

893
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,540
We'll never forgive Jack!

894
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,580
It's really foggy.

895
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,880
Will Zoro and the others be there too?

896
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,260
I think so.

897
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,930
I gave them directions to our hidden fortress.

898
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,060
Chambres

899
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,230
Oh, it's you guys!

900
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,070
Hey, Luffy! Where were you bitten?!
Do you still have your limbs?

901
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,440
Hey, you Nami-dog girl right there!
He's our captain!

902
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,030
You wanna eat him, don't you?!

903
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,400
I won't let you do that, you predatory tramp!

904
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,020
If you don't give us back him and our friends who came here first,

905
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,160
you'll see these three swords fire up!

906
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
I can't believe it.

907
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,730
I think you have the wrong idea.

908
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,370
But that's okay. We're here now.

909
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,920
What?

910
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,940
Look over there in the fog carefully...

911
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,040
There are guards and a gate to the fortress.

912
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,380
Wanda! Who are they-gara?

913
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,020
Are they the ones who invaded the Whale Forest?!

914
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,000
They didn't mean any harm!

915
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,520
The Welcoming Bell didn't ring by mistake

916
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,890
and one of them got lost in the Whale Forest!

917
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,920
Open the gate and let everybody know!

918
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,560
That the Straw Hats are here!

919
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,840
What?! Is that who they-gara are?!

920
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,870
Inside the fortress

921
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,280
Nami!

922
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,870
Nami!

923
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,820
Nami!!

924
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,280
Luffy and the others are here!

925
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,100
They're finally here!

926
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,220
Nami! Luffy and the others arrived!

927
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
They made it safely!

928
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,230
They did?! Really, Chopper?!

929
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,700
They're at the fortress gate!

930
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,400
Oh, your friends are here. That's good.

931
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Nami!

932
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm sorry.

933
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,320
They're important guests!

934
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,820
Prepare to welcome our great saviors' friends!

935
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,440
Garchu!

936
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,820
Garchu!

937
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,420
Welcome, Straw Hats!

938
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Garchu!

939
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,520
Welcome!

940
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,550
What?! What?!

941
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,590
Oh?! What the...?!

942
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,700
The atmosphere's quite upbeat!

943
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,020
This isn't what we heard about!

944
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,080
Garchu!

945
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,690
Garchu!

946
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,570
What's "Garchu"?

947
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,750
I thought the people of your race hate humans.

948
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,150
Race, huh?

949
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,650
That's probably what those who don't know other Minks think and get scared of.

950
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,310
Other Minks?

951
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,990
To us, you-teia guys are just Monkey Minks who have less hair.

952
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,620
You're the same Mink Tribe, just a different type.

953
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,960
Oh, so we humans are Monkey Minks.

954
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,930
That's right.

955
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,430
We judge someone by their character, not by their race.

956
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,510
Garchu!

957
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,490
We take pride in the hair covering our bodies, but,

958
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,590
you-teia guys have those beautiful...

959
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,110
..."lesser mink coats"
and quite a lot of us admire it.

960
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,640
Oh, you're right!

961
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,670
Oh, look! That's Nami and Chopper!

962
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm glad that they're okay!

963
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,520
Nami!

964
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,260
Nami! I'm happy for you! Garchu!

965
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,590
Garchu!

966
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,900
I got caught! Let me through!

967
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,790
Alright! Garchu! Garchu!

968
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,310
That's great! Garchu!

969
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,160
They're very friendly!
That's so different from what I expected!

970
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,580
Luffy!

971
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,490
Everybody!

972
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,630
Oh, you guys!
I'm so happy to see you again!

973
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,670
Nami! Chopper!

974
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,170
Usopp!

975
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,410
Sorry to keep you waiting, Chopper!

976
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,030
So Sanji, Brook, and Momo are all fine too!

977
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,470
I'm sorry!

978
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,420
Sanji-kun is...

979
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,370
Oh, the sun is setting!
We can't go any farther today!

980
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,350
Mm-hm! Let's go back to the ship
and climb again tomorrow!

981
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,010
I like how you drink!
Here, have another cup!

982
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,780
Go ahead and drink!

983
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,850
It's our special "Monkey Wine."
It's made from the abundance of fruits in the forest.

984
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,550
Yeah! It tastes good!

985
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,800
Go away, you fools!
Don't press yourselves against me!

986
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,170
What?! Let's play!

987
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,970
Let me give you love bites!

988
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,770
Let us garchu!

989
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,250
Let me lick you!

990
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,230
Shut up! Don't be such a baby!

991
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,210
Whoa-whoa, don't get mad, Zoro!

992
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,100
Look how well they're treating us!
You're so rude!

993
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,110
Please overlook these cultural differences.
Minkship is a friendly gesture to us.

994
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,860
It's delicious! What kind of meat is this?!

995
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,090
That's hippo.
And these are lizard, alligator, and frog.

996
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,250
We don't eat animals with fur.

997
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,990
But why do you welcome us like this?

998
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,360
Because you-teia guys are our saviors' friends!

999
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Saviors... What happened exactly?

1000
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,970
N-Nooooo!!

1001
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,090
Brook!

1002
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,950
What a relief! I read in the newspaper!

1003
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm glad that you're all okay!

1004
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,990
Luffy-san!

1005
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,450
What happened to you?!

1006
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,030
I'm sorry about Sanji-san!

1007
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,430
I'm too ashamed to face you!

1008
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,170
But I don't have a facial surface anyway.

1009
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,070
Oh?! Hey, aren't you with Momo?!

1010
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,140
Yes, of course, he's okay but it seems like...

1011
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,230
...he doesn't really like the Minks.

1012
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,870
What? Doesn't he like these nice people?

1013
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,580
No. He shuts himself in a room and never comes out.

1014
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,590
But that's good for us.

1015
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,090
Huh?

1016
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,470
Luffy-san, could I have a word with you?

1017
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,670
Come this way.

1018
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,190
All of you newcomers to Zou, come here!

1019
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,430
Where is Kin'emon-san now?

1020
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,340
He should be arriving soon.

1021
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,470
I see. That's perfect.

1022
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:33,320
I want you to try not to use words like
"samurai" or "Wano Country" in this country.

1023
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,100
Don't use them if you can.

1024
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,540
If you use those words, you might offend many people

1025
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,360
and anger them or make them hate you.

1026
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,460
Offend?

1027
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,320
Anger? Hate?

1028
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,170
Why "samurai"...

1029
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,410
Well, this country was actually...

1030
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,030
I found you!

1031
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,730
Baron Corpse!

1032
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,930
Here they come!

1033
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,160
"Corpse"?!

1034
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,960
You'll reach the Rightflank Forest! And you'll find the corpse of your-teia friend there!

1035
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,410
C-Corpse?!

1036
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,380
So the corpse of a friend...

1037
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,140
She was talking about Brook!

1038
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,910
We call him so with affection.

1039
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,180
That's very confusing.

1040
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,170
To be honest, I was surprised...

1041
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,610
I didn't know there was such a tempting race in this world!

1042
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,080
Stop it! Help!

1043
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,960
We Dog Minks... h-have a thing for bones!

1044
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,290
Stop chewing on me!

1045
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,570
How stupid...

1046
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,030
By the way, Luffy, what happened to Tra-guy?

1047
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,460
Oh, he went to the Bear Forest.

1048
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey! More importantly, what should we do about Sanji-kun?!

1049
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,940
Like I said before, he left a note.
So don't you think it's gonna be alright?

1050
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,750
Yeah, it's not like he was kidnapped.

1051
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm worried because it didn't look right!

1052
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,120
I'm sorry!

1053
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,120
We couldn't do anything!

1054
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,330
You don't need to cry!

1055
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,640
Well, you know what, guys?
Frankly, we're just confused right now.

1056
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,330
We only have a rough idea of what's going on.

1057
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,640
He's right!

1058
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,790
The last time we talked, you guys said you were facing Big Mom's ship!

1059
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:44,140
Now we finally got to Zou and there are those talking animals on the elephant's back and the city's ruined!

1060
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,740
We thought the Mink Tribe was our enemy,
but instead, they welcomed us so warmly!

1061
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,350
They even told us we're their saviors' friends!

1062
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,720
Could you tell us everything in detail, Nami?

1063
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,980
What's happened to your group since you left Dressrosa eleven days ago?

1064
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,110
Yeah, I guess I was a little upset.

1065
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay, I'll tell you
everything as it happened.

1066
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,110
What we encountered that day off the coast of Dressrosa was...

1067
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,440
...the Big Mom Pirates' enormous singing ship!

1068
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,380
Singing?!

1069
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,780
Ship! Ship!

1070
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,720
Their combatants that we could identify were the duo that Luffy met on the Fishman Island.

1071
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,330
Mama! I see Caesar! Grr!

1072
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,930
Let's sink their ship and recover just Caesar-soir!

1073
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,500
And another one...

1074
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,600
He's one of the Worst Generation.

1075
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,700
Capone "Gang" Bege!

1076
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,550
Bege?

1077
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,980
Seems like they became Big Mom's subordinates.

1078
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,030
They came for Caesar,
but he was more scared of them.

1079
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,630
But, frankly speaking, we had no chance to get away from them.

1080
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,660
And we knew they'd take us down if nothing was done!

1081
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,030
Let's get out of here with Coup de Burst!

1082
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,760
What about Gaon Cannon?!

1083
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,700
No! We don't have enough Cola!
I have another idea instead!

1084
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,400
If you have an idea, just do it!

1085
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,040
Help us if you wanna survive!

1086
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,680
Brook! Let's fight them at the stern
and let them drop their guard!

1087
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,060
Soul Parade!

1088
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,370
Cho-Cho-Cho-Cho-Cho... Chopperemon?!

1089
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,240
Catch, Chopper!

1090
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,610
No! Let go of me!

1091
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,750
I'll get even with you bastard!
How could you use my body like a bag?!

1092
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,910
We won't help you
if you don't stop resisting!

1093
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,020
No!

1094
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,990
All yours, Sanji!

1095
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,410
That's Caesar! Grr!

1096
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,170
What are they doing-bon?!

1097
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,270
Nice pitch, Chopper!

1098
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,170
How can he fly?!

1099
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
Poele a Frire...

1100
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
{\an8}Frying Pan

1101
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,200
...Spectre!

1102
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,200
{\an8}Spectrum

1103
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,560
Oh no! Grr!

1104
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,090
Turn away-bon!

1105
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,480
Ship!

1106
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,300
The starboard side's been damaged!

1107
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,700
Okay! It's my turn!

1108
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,350
Clima-Tact

1109
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,510
Weather...

1110
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,830
...Egg!

1111
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,410
Come hatch, rain clouds!

1112
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
Rain Tempo!

1113
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,810
Why did the weather change in just that area-bon?!

1114
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,570
We're gonna lose them! Grr!

1115
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,630
Only you guys could do that!

1116
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,440
That doesn't make me blush, you idiot!

1117
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,600
That was a white-knuckler!

1118
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,400
That's super!

1119
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,550
That's great!

1120
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,680
Stop it!
Well, it was a big deal I guess but...

1121
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,950
And how many days did it take to get to Zou from there?

1122
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,950
We arrived here the next day.

1123
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,560
Seems like Zou was nearby at that time.

1124
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,530
That was 10 days ago.

1125
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,690
As far as I could see,

1126
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,060
the oldest sign of destruction
in the city at the center of Zou was...

1127
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,510
...from a little more than two weeks ago.

1128
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,240
That's right.

1129
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,830
And by 10 days ago,
most of the country had been destroyed.

1130
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,830
But on that day, Nami and the others arrived here.

1131
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,520
That can only be described as a miracle!

1132
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,260
If not for their courage
and Chopper's medical expertise,

1133
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,060
every single person in the Mokomo Dukedom would've been helplessly killed...

1134
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,930
I know that it just happened and it still hurts,

1135
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,510
so if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine but...

1136
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,460
No, I'll tell you everything.

1137
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,650
You-teia people have the right to know everything.

1138
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,120
Hey!

1139
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,060
Everybody!

1140
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,760
Duke-sama has woken up!

1141
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,700
That's great!

1142
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,870
Duke-sama... He's all right now...

1143
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,150
Okay! Let's go examine his condition now!

1144
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,140
Miyagi! Tristan!

1145
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, wait for me!

1146
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,790
Okay, okay!
Let me go at it and learn from you!

1147
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,160
Dr. Miyagi! You're hopping too much!

1148
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,090
Wanda!

1149
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,560
Duke Inuarashi said he'd like to see the saviors!

1150
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,810
Okay, I'll be right up!

1151
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,450
You-teia guys, will you come with me?!

1152
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,270
Yeah but who's Inuarashi?

1153
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,110
He's the duke of the Mokomo Dukedom.

1154
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,950
Which means he's the ruler of the country!

1155
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,450
He'd been in a coma ever since the city was wiped out.

1156
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,160
So has the other one.

1157
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,570
The other one?!

1158
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,460
Yes! This country has two rulers!

1159
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,060
"King of the Day" - Duke Inuarashi!

1160
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,490
"King of the Night" - Master Nekomamushi!

1161
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,860
Captain!

1162
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,190
You came for us!

1163
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,300
Captain!

1164
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,700
Captain!

1165
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,830
Captain, it's amazing that you beat Doflamingo!

1166
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,940
No, that's Straw Hat-ya's...

1167
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,570
We have a lot to catch up on!
Let's go deeper into the forest!

1168
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,600
Okay.

1169
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,430
The Rightflank Fortress

1170
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,160
But it happened half a month ago.

1171
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,760
It was 17 days ago to be exact.

1172
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,460
Yes, the first time in a month and a half since Bepo and the others arrived,

1173
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,230
the visitor's bell rang all over the Mokomo Dukedom.

1174
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,170
But...

1175
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,470
That was...

1176
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,240
...the seldom-heard Raiding Bell!

1177
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,950
What's that bell?

1178
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,450
That's the Raiding Bell!

1179
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,250
What?!

1180
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,350
Raiding?!

1181
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,150
No wonder a young lady like you-gara doesn't know.

1182
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,000
It rarely rings.

1183
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,260
The gate has been broken down! It's pirates!

1184
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,000
Cutting up the forest along the way,
the enemy invaded our peaceful city.

1185
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,610
Feeling such unusual movement,
Zunesha roared!

1186
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,550
Who were they?! What did they want?!

1187
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:22,860
If our vicious enemies want something that we don't have...

1188
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,360
How can we give it to them?

1189
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,750
Alright, give him to us now!

1190
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,640
I know you have a warrior from the
Land of Wano named Raizou here!

1191
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,990
