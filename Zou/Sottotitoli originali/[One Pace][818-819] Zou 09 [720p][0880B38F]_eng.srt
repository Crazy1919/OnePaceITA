780
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

781
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

782
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

783
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

784
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}

785
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}yes

786
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}we

787
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,380
{\an8}can!

788
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

789
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

790
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

791
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

792
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

793
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

794
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

795
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

796
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,350
Momonosuke, Heir of the Kozuki Family

797
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,920
Nin-nin!

798
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,980
I wanna see more ninjutsu! Nin-nin!

799
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,140
Cut the Nin-nin crap!

800
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,500
You already saw my ninjutsu accidentally.

801
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,000
Accidentally?

802
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,680
I know you did them for us!

803
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,480
Are you guys crying?

804
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
Don't be silly!

805
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,640
Men from the Wano Country don't cry!

806
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,020
It's just...

807
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,620
It wasn't like this when I arrived here!

808
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
The streets were bustling...

809
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,260
And people were living their lives!

810
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,940
And the whole country...

811
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,600
...was full of energy!

812
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,840
Damn those Minks!

813
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,540
What they did was so rash!

814
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,580
I will work as hard as I can to avenge you!

815
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,320
So forgive me!

816
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,780
Forgive me!

817
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,840
Hey, you-gara guys!

818
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,800
Seems like the deciphering of the stone is done!

819
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,800
Come back into the whale!

820
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,060
What do you think, Nami?

821
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,320
Is this what's written on the Poneglyph?

822
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
Yeah, I can draw a nautical chart based on this!

823
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,820
We can pinpoint the location of something, Robin!

824
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,440
That red stone is called a Road Poneglyph!

825
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,160
All the tough guys of the sea are
searching for the end of the Grand Line...

826
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,180
And that stone is a guide to get there!

827
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,140
The Whale Forest is considered sacred because of it

828
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,770
so it needs to be protected by us Guardians!

829
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
The end of the Grand Line...

830
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,280
You mean, a guide to the
last island - Raftel?!

831
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,360
That's right!

832
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,710
What?!

833
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,540
However...

834
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
Raftel?!

835
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,480
That's the goal!
To become King of the Pirates!

836
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,720
Finally, we can get there!
The last island - Raftel!

837
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,880
That's the island the flower pops mentioned!

838
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,200
Does it say where Raftel is?!

839
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,800
Wait, wait, don't jump to conclusions!
Hear me out. You see...

840
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,740
There are four of those red stones, the Road Poneglyphs, in the world!

841
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,180
What?! Does it mean there are four Raftels?!

842
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,220
No, there aren't! Let him finish first!

843
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,730
That stone must indicate the location of
some unknown spot but it's not Raftel.

844
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,140
The other three Road Poneglyphs all indicate
different locations in the same manner.

845
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,580
When you learn where those locations are
and connect those four points on a map,

846
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,420
those lines will cross at the center!

847
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:20,960
That's the place only the King of the Pirates and his crew have reached in all these centuries.

848
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
The last island!

849
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,560
The island Raftel!

850
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,260
The last island - Raftel!

851
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,540
Raftel...

852
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,540
Finally!

853
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,880
I wonder if it's there!

854
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,080
Or not!

855
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,570
The One Piece!

856
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,090
Okay! Let's go search!

857
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,540
Where are you going?! It's a big world!

858
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,780
I'll get back Sanji quickly!

859
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,070
Listen to me!

860
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,640
You-gara, going to Whole Cake Island along with Pekoms,

861
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,090
is a pretty good idea.

862
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Of the four Road Poneglyphs,
we are missing the whereabouts of only one.

863
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
We have one here.

864
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
And the other two are
under the control of some pirates.

865
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,080
Pirates?

866
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,060
Emperor Big Mom!

867
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,360
And another Emperor -
Kaidou, King of the Beasts!

868
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,780
What?!

869
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,160
I see!

870
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,060
So we should just rob them!

871
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,620
Oh, I suddenly see nothing but darkness
before my eyes...

872
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,480
Me too!

873
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,800
Why?! We gotta kick their butts anyway
so let's just do it!

874
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
Don't say it like it's nothing!

875
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,590
I didn't care much because I thought
we wouldn't fight them anytime soon

876
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,180
but the thought of it makes me wet myself!

877
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,040
Yeah! We'll wet our pants!
Don't mess with us!

878
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,240
But you don't need to steal the Poneglyphs.

879
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,120
We don't?

880
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,000
Usually, people can copy their text
like making a rubbing.

881
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,060
No one goes around carrying around
such massive stones.

882
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,220
I've got an idea!

883
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,580
In that case, we'll sneak into
Big Mom and Kaidou's headquarters

884
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
and get the copies!

885
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,300
Then, we'll reach Raftel before anyone knows!

886
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,160
And you'll become the King of the Pirates!

887
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,420
What's your problem, you dummy?!

888
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,180
That's not manly at all!
Whoever it is, we can just kick their butts!

889
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,320
Easy, easy, easy!

890
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,560
Stop!

891
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,520
But I'm more worried about
you-gara, Nico Robin.

892
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,780
Those-gara who are interested in the Void Century.

893
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,740
are now collecting the copies across the world

894
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,060
but no one can read them.

895
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,060
Big names all around the world will...

896
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,860
...surely target you-gara and try to kidnap you when they're ready to read them.

897
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,540
K-Kidnap Robin?!

898
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,700
What?!

899
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
It's no problem.

900
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,460
I have strong friends who will protect me.

901
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,940
Whoa-whoa, did you say "Strong"?
That makes me blush!

902
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,380
I'll kick anyone's butt for you!

903
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,880
You shouldn't count on me like that...

904
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,720
I'll protect Robin-san no matter what!

905
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll do anything for Robin too!

906
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,860
Super!

907
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I won't let anyone touch Robin!

908
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,960
If they do, I'll take their lives and money!

909
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,380
They-gara are very dependable!

910
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,280
You have good friends.

911
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,860
By the way, how do you guys know
so much about the Poneglyphs?

912
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,160
It all started with our master -

913
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,460
Kozuki Oden-sama who used to
have an interest in the stones.

914
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,240
Because...

915
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,830
Is it okay to tell them, dog?

916
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,220
Go ahead. You don't have
to hide anything from them.

917
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,220
You can tell them anything.

918
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,220
Did you say "Go ahead"?
What's that bossy attitude?!

919
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,800
I am their boss! You insolent dork!

920
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,480
The Kozuki Family of the Wano Country was, in fact,

921
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,580
a clan of stonemasons that has quarried stones and processed them for generations.

922
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,800
They are still highly skilled.

923
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,500
Stonemasons?

924
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,340
Yes. It goes way back, 800 years ago...

925
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,440
The Kozuki Clan invented an indestructible book with their sophisticated skills.

926
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,060
That's what the Poneglyphs are!

927
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,380
What?!

928
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,580
The Kozuki Family?!

929
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,120
Were they the ones who made all
those Poneglyphs in the world?!

930
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,200
You made the stones that
Robin is looking for?!

931
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,120
Not me! It was my ancestors from way back!

932
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,410
Then, do you guys know
what's written on them?!

933
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,520
That hasn't been passed down fully
through the generations.

934
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,580
You can find it out by reading the stones.

935
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,840
The only thing that has been passed down was how to read and write the ancient text.

936
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,020
However...

937
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,380
Unfortunately, that's...

938
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,780
Before it was passed down to Momonosuke-sama,

939
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,140
it was cut off at his father -
Kozuki Oden-sama's generation!

940
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,620
By "cut off," you mean
Momonosuke-san's father is...

941
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,280
Yes, Oden-sama is...

942
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,960
Wano...

943
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,290
Wa...

944
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,260
Wa...

945
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,120
Oden wouldn't be "oden"
if it wasn't boiled!

946
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,860
Hey! It's okay if you
don't wanna talk about it!

947
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,540
Oden-sama was...

948
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,420
...executed!

949
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,400
By the shogun of the Wano Country
and the pirate Kaidou!

950
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,280
What?!

951
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,960
To save all of us retainers,

952
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,380
he met his fate!

953
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
By Kaidou?!

954
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,210
Kaidou...

955
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,960
And...

956
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,720
...Emperor Kaidou's Beast Pirates are...

957
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,180
...still in the Wano Country!

958
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,980
In the Wano Country?

959
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,940
If you don't wanna talk about it,
that's okay but...

960
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,980
...why was your master executed?

961
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,420
You guys have been captured and targeted
because of that, haven't you?

962
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,160
Yes, you're right.
You could say it's a cardinal sin.

963
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,060
Kaidou is trying to pull information from us!

964
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,870
The previous daimyo - Kozuki Oden-sama...

965
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:50,020
...traveled to the last island Raftel
with the King of the Pirates - Gol D. Roger

966
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,360
and witnessed the secret of the world!

967
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,360
What?!

968
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,200
Momonosuke's father...

969
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,280
...went to Raftel with Gold Roger?!

970
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,880
Was your father one of
the Pirate King's crew?!

971
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,760
He witnessed the secret of the world?
Probably, with Rayleigh-san too.

972
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,580
Yes. We know.

973
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,120
We learned the entirety of history.

974
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,620
I see!

975
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,500
In order to get the secret of
the world out of you retainers,

976
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,400
Doflamingo and Caesar
who were tied to Kaidou...

977
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,980
...were trying to catch you guys.

978
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,060
That's right!

979
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,580
However...

980
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,300
Oden-sama didn't want to
burden us with the secret.

981
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,580
We don't know anything!

982
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,640
Yes, but even if we knew it,
we wouldn't tell anybody.

983
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,940
Whether we know or not,
we'll keep being hunted!

984
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,820
If so, the only option we have is to fight!

985
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,660
The words he left behind
were just one phrase!

986
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,780
"Open up the Wano Country!"

987
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,040
What do they mean by "open up"?

988
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,140
The Wano Country is closed off to the world.

989
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,240
It's a pity that, although we should have been shields for our master Oden-sama,

990
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,740
we were saved by him instead
and we brought shame to ourselves!

991
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,740
What we have to do now is

992
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,400
to put our lives on the
line and avenge our master!

993
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,600
We need to kill the shogun
who stole the Wano Country

994
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,400
and open the closed country to the world!

995
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,540
That's our wish!

996
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,160
The Wano Country is almost
entirely under the control

997
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,180
of the shogun and Kaidou who've joined forces.

998
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,180
Our friends are trying to
muster dissidents there now

999
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,460
but they're still vastly outnumbered by
the enemy's great army!

1000
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,620
There's no chance to win!

1001
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,500
So that's what's happening there.

1002
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,120
But we have to win!

1003
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,340
Thus, we set out to sea to look for allies who will fight with us.

1004
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,220
First, we were heading for Zou!

1005
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,970
Yes, the Kozuki Clan and the Minks

1006
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,840
have a special bond from way back, which means whatever happens, we'll share the same fate!

1007
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,820
More than anything, the dog and I are
Oden-sama's direct retainers.

1008
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,720
Ever since the day Raizo arrived here,
all of our warriors were prepared!

1009
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,920
But when we actually fought...

1010
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,140
...it turned out like this against Jack's unit
which was just a part of Kaidou's army!

1011
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,840
How disappointing.

1012
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,500
What a shame.

1013
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,120
Hey! But that's because they
used that dirty weapon!

1014
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,220
No one could've expected
they'd use the poison gas!

1015
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,400
If there were a judge to call foul and we'd win,
maybe that would work, but...

1016
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,360
No matter how dirty they play,
this is our country!

1017
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,820
We should've won!

1018
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,950
But we won't let it happen again!
We won't repeat the same failure!

1019
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,660
We have an ace up our sleeve too.

1020
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,980
If we fight again, we'll show them
the true power of the Mink Tribe!

1021
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Now, we have a favor to ask, Luffy-dono!

1022
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,820
And you too, Law-dono!

1023
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,700
I know it's presumptuous of me to ask
you a favor after you saved my life

1024
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,900
but I've been impressed by
how strong you guys are!

1025
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,660
Since we are fated to share the same purpose,

1026
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,640
will you help us fight to kill
the shogun of the Wano Country

1027
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,140
and Emperor Kaidou?!

1028
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,920
Oh! Yes! Who can ask for more?!

1029
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,240
Those samurai and the Minks!
They'll be a big help for us too!

1030
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,540
We were gonna fight Kaidou sooner or later!
We gotta jump at this chance!

1031
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,860
They even have a ninja, Luffy!

1032
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,060
I refuse!

1033
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,510
Don't!

1034
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,610
Tell me you're kidding!

1035
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,030
Why can't you get it?!

1036
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,330
Think about it!
We have to join hands!

1037
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,010
Are you out of your mind?!

1038
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,260
Just a moment! Forget about what he said!
We'll teach him a lesson!

1039
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,190
Stop!

1040
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,410
Luffy, think again!

1041
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,150
This will make you less of a man!

1042
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,510
Wait!

1043
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,870
I think Luffy has a point there.

1044
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,630
Nami?!

1045
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,240
I'm gonna go...

1046
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,250
...negotiate!

1047
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,650
That's not it! No!

1048
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,250
Are you just a figurehead, Momo?!

1049
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,530
You say it!

1050
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,760
Aren't you an important person?!

1051
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,830
You're a leader of these
great men, aren't you?!

1052
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,270
Are you gonna just cry?!

1053
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,930
How could you make him cry like that?!
Don't be harsh to an eight-year old!

1054
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:38,230
Luffy-san. Generally, heirs don't necessarily stand on their feet until they're fully grown.

1055
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,800
If adults assist them properly...

1056
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,550
Oh, Momonosuke-san?

1057
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,170
Yes, come here, Momo-chan.

1058
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,030
I'm sorry for what our stupid captain said to you...

1059
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,120
You can't see it all!
And that's how the world is, Momonosuke!

1060
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,120
Father, I...

1061
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,590
We're surrounded!

1062
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,080
Mother!

1063
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,270
Ready the flaming arrows!

1064
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,100
Run! There must be a way out!

1065
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,590
Everyone! Run!

1066
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,850
Your father is...

1067
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,350
...a foolish lord!

1068
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,710
I want to bring down Kaidou!

1069
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,450
He was an enemy to my parents!

1070
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,910
He killed my mother too!

1071
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:20,060
I wish to grow up
and become strong quickly

1072
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,690
and avenge my father and mother!

1073
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,910
I want to protect all my retainers too!

1074
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,190
Momonosuke-sama!

1075
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,990
It's enough to know that you feel that way!

1076
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,490
You-gara got older and weepy.

1077
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,870
Shut up!

1078
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,490
But because my body's still small,
I can't do that!

1079
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,030
That's why I want you to fight with me!

1080
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,770
I'm begging you!

1081
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,020
Please...

1082
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,110
I got it!

1083
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,690
Let's join hands!

1084
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,390
We're allies!

1085
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,770
Let me have Kaidou's head though!

1086
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,110
Thank you! Thank you!

1087
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,210
You're doing it wrong!
You gotta grab tight! Like this!

1088
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,310
Thank you!

1089
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,330
With more energy!

1090
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,170
But I am grabbing your hand...

1091
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,470
No, do this!

1092
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,390
He's right. This is how it should be.

1093
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,970
Our leaders are bonded! This is great!

1094
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,350
Strawhatter.

1095
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,100
Didn't you have to ask me first?

1096
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,730
It's cool, right?

1097
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,090
Yeah, but...

1098
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,090
I'm so relieved!

1099
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,810
We have to reflect on what we were doing.

1100
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,430
We were treating him as a child
but he is the head of the Kozuki Clan.

1101
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,650
We were forgetting about that
and thinking we have to protect him.

1102
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,490
Even though that was too harsh
on an eight-year old,

1103
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,100
no one treats Momonosuke-sama
as a whole man...

1104
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,750
...like Luffy-dono does!

1105
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,710
Uh-huh! You're right!

1106
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,390
Now I know why you guys admire him so much.

1107
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,290
All right! Guys! Gather up!

1108
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,130
Our objective is...

1109
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,530
...to kick Emperor Kaidou's butt!

1110
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:18,250
We're the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance!

1111
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,390
That's too long!

1112
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,590
Is "Ninja" necessary?

1113
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,150
Of course, it is!

1114
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,370
Okay, okay.

1115
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,320
Our enemy is Kaidou!

1116
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,920
Inuarashi, Nekomamushi!

1117
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,700
Momo, Kin'emon, Kanjuro and the ninja!

1118
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,120
And Tra-guy too!

1119
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,980
We all join our hands to take down Kaidou!
That's what we allied for!

1120
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,480
Guys! Don't ever bow your heads!
Nor get down on your knees!

1121
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,460
An alliance means...

1122
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,760
...friendship!

1123
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Not necessarily!

1124
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,380
We're already allies
but there's one condition.

1125
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,780
Well, isn't that something you should've told us before we agreed to join forces?!

1126
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,280
What is the condition?

1127
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,780
One of our crew isn't with us now.

1128
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,420
Oh, it's about Sanji, isn't it?

1129
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,680
Sanji?

1130
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,320
Well, a lot has happened...

1131
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,790
What?! Big Mom?!
I haven't heard about this!

1132
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,880
It happened while you were sleeping.

1133
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,820
I'll go and get him back
so don't go off to fight until then!

1134
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,830
Is that the condition?
If so, sure, we'll wait.

1135
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,720
Thanks! In return, Sanji will be a big help!

1136
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,740
It's like getting help from a thousand people!

1137
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,840
I'm worth two thousand people!

1138
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,980
Okay, okay.

1139
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,520
I see. Sounds like he's pretty dependable
but will you be alright?

1140
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,100
You're talking about Emperor Big Mom!

1141
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,810
I'm not gonna fight her so I'll be fine.
I'll go with Pekomamushi!

1142
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,810
{\an8}Pekomamushi - Lion Viper

1143
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,340
Peko...mamushi?

1144
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,850
Pekomamushi!

1145
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,600
Guardians' 
Residential District

1146
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,380
Today is really a miraculous day!

1147
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
Yeah! It is a great day!

1148
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,040
Those two even split the day in half
because they didn't want to see each other

1149
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,760
but now they're reconciled!

1150
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,760
Yeah, it's hard to believe
that such a day has come.

1151
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,860
They say Duke Inuarashi and Master Nekomamushi
were once closest friends.

1152
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,820
However when they came back
from a long journey barely alive,

1153
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,180
they were already deep in a feud.

1154
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,480
Every time they came face-to-face,
they'd try to kill each other.

1155
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,760
I wonder what happened...

1156
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,740
That was before I was born, right?

1157
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,750
Yes. Even Pedro and I
were small at that time.

1158
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,460
Let's have a banquet to celebrate the reconciliation of our kings today!

1159
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,720
We can wake up and go to bed anytime we like!

1160
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,800
Target confirmed, Jack-sama!

1161
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,720
Yeah, I see it. You don't have to tell me.

1162
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,740
Damn. I can't believe I came back here.

1163
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,300
Sheepshead.

1164
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,720
"Raizo wasn't there."

1165
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,260
I didn't expect you to come back saying that.

1166
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,320
The Minks have a strong vital force.

1167
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,500
What if those who escaped the gas
were able to treat the others who passed out?

1168
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,080
Keep your mouth shut, Sheepshead-sama!

1169
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,660
If he finds out that not only are the Minks alive but also that we were kicked off the island by someone...

1170
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,680
When you start killing someone, don't stop until he dies!

1171
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,800
Mercy will only cause
the messy business of revenge!

1172
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,540
You don't need to worry!

1173
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,360
The Minks are weakening anyway.
If we make a raid, they'll just...

1174
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,480
That's not necessary.

1175
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,820
We'll kill the giant elephant!

1176
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,600
