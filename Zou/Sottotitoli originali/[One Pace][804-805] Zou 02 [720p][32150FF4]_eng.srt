1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,030
I've never seen the end of 
the world with my own eyes

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,910
That's why I start a 
journey with you, we can!

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,590
Traveling from sea to sea

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,050
that it's just a fantasy

5
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:39,190
There are tons of unimaginable truth

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,740
Don't turn a blind eye

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,460
Common sense is just the mind of the masses

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,260
I've never seen the end of 
the world with my own eyes

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,180
That's why we've got to go, 
Captain Live-By-My-Own-Rules

10
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,970
Who says it's impossible? 
Nothing has started yet

11
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,940
I want to know everything now, yes, we can!

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,230
Yes, we can! You can!

13
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,900
This moment

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,610
We can! I can!

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,320
This great feeling

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,580
Now, now, yes, we can!

17
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,090
Yes, we can!

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,120
The Mink Tribe

19
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,620
Etetetetete...

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,640
"Ete"?

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,020
That's right! Raizo runs with that kind of rhythm.

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,520
I think he has this kind of power.

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,280
Ninpo - Blindfold Technique!
Guess who!

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,800
I-Is it Kanjuro?
I mean I know you're the only person there.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,340
Look out! Duck!

26
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,120
Hey! Stop the silly ninpo nonsense...

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,340
Oh no! Those two fell!

28
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,780
Damn! What was that thing that fell on us out of the blue?!

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,180
I don't know. I think it was a bloody person with knives stuck all over his body...

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,280
What?!

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,640
Or just a small monkey.

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,680
You're scaring me!
What made you think that?!

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,900
Kin'emon! Kanjuro!

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,840
Kin'emon! Kanjuro!

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Did they fall into the water?

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,680
Let's go save them!

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,170
Luffy-dono! We're both okay!

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,500
That's Kin'emon!

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,420
Good! They're alive!

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,740
Go ahead! We'll catch up soon!

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,020
What is he talking about? No way!
Let's go back down!

42
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,520
Hey, Dragon! Head back down!

43
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,880
Ryunosuke, head back...

44
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,950
Hey, Ryunosuke...

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
How can we tell this poor guy to go back...

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
Seems like he wants to finish his job as soon as possible.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,670
He's suffering.
Let's let him keep going.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,020
So cute...

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,190
I'm sorry but we're gonna go ahead!
See you guys later!

50
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,360
Understood!

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,060
Hey! I won't allow you to enter the country!

52
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,920
Go ahead!

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,580
Huh? I think I just heard an unknown voice.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,470
Come on, Ryunosuke!

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,420
You can do it!

56
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,740
Luffy!

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,960
Isn't that the top?!

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
What?

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
Oh! It is!

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,140
A little more to go, Ryunosuke!

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,460
The top?!

62
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,060
The top is close at hand!

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh! So fast!

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,960
Ryunosuke! Make a final sprint!

65
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Keep going! Ryunosuke!

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,580
Just a little more to go! Run!

67
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,880
You're almost there!

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
You're almost there!

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
You're almost there!

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,460
You're almost there!

71
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,600
You're almost there!

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,570
You're almost there!

73
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,180
Yes! I'm starting to see something!

74
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Ryunosuke! Come on! It's right there!

75
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,650
Ryunosuke!

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,040
Ryunosuke!

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,290
You can do it, Ryunosuke!

78
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,440
Ryunosuke!

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,420
Ryunosuke!

80
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,400
Ryunosuke!

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,760
Ryunosuke!

82
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,280
We made it!

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,300
To the top!

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,970
We finally made it!

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,200
Ryunosuke! Good job!

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,340
We're here at Zou!

87
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,700
You're turning back to a drawing.

88
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,260
Hey, wait!

89
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,880
Ryunosuke!

90
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,300
Ryunosuke!

91
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,040
Ryunosuke!

92
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,020
Ryunosuke!

93
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,580
Ryunosuke!

94
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,950
This is absurd.

95
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,820
It's just a bad drawing.

96
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,980
Hey, hold it right there, you bastards!

97
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,860
Is that how you thank him for bringing you up here?!

98
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,960
We're in unknown territory.
We shouldn't look back.

99
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,170
You're right but...

100
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,400
Usopp! Ryunosuke was a good guy, wasn't he?!

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,970
Always pay attention to what lies ahead. Look.

102
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,370
That must be a gate into the country.

103
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,140
There is certainly civilization on the elephant's back.

104
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,860
There's a watchtower but no guards.
It's not security befitting a country.

105
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,100
Tsk! They're so cold!

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,080
Honestly! You guys snapped out of it too quickly!

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,660
Hey, Usopp! Come up here!
It's amazing!

108
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
You climbed the watchtower so quickly!

109
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,880
It's awesome!

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,020
So this is the back of the elephant!

111
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,490
No kidding!
Is this really the elephant's back?!

112
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,310
It's so interesting!

113
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,400
There's a massive, millennia-old elephant...

114
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,080
And there's a country on its back!

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,820
Yeah!

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,120
It has a forest, a river, and a town!

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,840
This sure is awesome!
It's exactly like an island!

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
Usopp! That tree's like a whale!

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,980
You're right!

120
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,260
The town is bigger than I thought!

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,730
But that town is sort of...

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,740
Luffy jumped down!

123
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,400
I knew he'd do that.
Do you see old "Eyebrows"?

124
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,300
No.

125
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,000
This place is too high to see anybody.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Zoro, shouldn't we wait for Kin'emon and Kanjuro?

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,490
It's not as vast as a continent.
Let's just go.

128
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,830
Wait, wait!
I'm coming with you guys!

129
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,900
He didn't have to jump. The gate's open.

130
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,440
No, I think this is...

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,190
Yeah, it's not actually open...

132
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,660
Someone destroyed it.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,910
You're right.

134
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,560
This trail looks strange too.

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,840
It's too wide to call it an animal trail in a forest.

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,420
Hey, this is some pretty serious destruction!

137
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,320
And it's still fresh.
Are Sanji and the others gonna be okay?!

138
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,420
What a mess!

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,140
I couldn't see it from up there but what's going on here?!

140
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's proceed with caution!

141
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,650
What?! We don't really know the residents here and we have other enemies?!

142
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,220
Whoa-whoa, hey!

143
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,780
W-W-W-Wait a minute, guys! Please!

144
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,540
You don't need to rush like that!

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,820
It's hard to walk.

146
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,140
Yeah, it's elephant's skin.

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,680
There are flowers in such strange spots.

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,810
What happened to Bariete?

149
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,250
The Lesser Minks passed through the gate.

150
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,630
He might've been taken down!

151
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,360
It's a town!

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,660
No one's here!
What's wrong with this country?!

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,800
They're all run-down!

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,360
Hey! Sanji! Nami!

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,680
Chopper! Brook! Momo!

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,410
Oh, and the gas guy.
Well, forget about him.

157
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,080
What happened here?

158
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,760
I smell the faint odor of gunpowder...
And gas, do you?

159
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,840
What's this all about? Can't we just lie back in a peaceful country sometimes?!

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,190
What?! What is it?!
Do you see something?!

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,940
I got this.

162
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,130
Did she just...

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,460
...jump in midair?!

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,470
What the...?!

165
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,380
Wait! Stop, Carrot!

166
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,460
Forget about them-teia!

167
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,540
More importantly, we have an invader in the Whale Forest!

168
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,640
Talking animals?!

169
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,620
They're the Mink Tribe!

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,660
Oh?! I-Isn't that outfit...

171
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,600
...Nami's?!

172
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,260
What is that weapon?
I felt a shock for a moment!

173
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,500
We have an invader in the Whale Forest?!

174
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,040
Yes, we're in trouble!

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,120
The Guardians will be mad!

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,380
An animal?!

177
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,920
A human?!

178
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,060
Hey, you!
Where did you get that outfit?!

179
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,510
What did you do to Nami?!

180
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,380
Are they a cannibal tribe?

181
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,020
Don't say such a scary thing!

182
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,700
I'm sorry! Don't eat me!

183
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,540
Look how high she can jump!

184
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,720
Do all of them have physical abilities like that?!

185
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
How is it?!

186
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,120
Do you see something, Carrot?!

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,140
I do! Maybe it's a little too late!

188
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,110
On the other side of Kurau City,
there's a disturbance in the Whale Forest!

189
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,520
I thought so! Let's go, Warney!

190
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,300
Get on, Carrot!

191
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,240
We don't have time to
transport you-teia guys!

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,310
Do as I say!

193
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,720
Go through the Rightrump Forest to your right

194
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,610
and turn left at a deep dark swamp...
You'll reach the Rightflank Forest!

195
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,590
You'll find the corpse of your-teia friend there!

196
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,020
C-Corpse?!

197
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,660
Wait at the Rightflank Forest!
We'll be there later!

198
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,790
Do you think they-teia are gonna be okay?

199
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,960
Those were the Straw Hats.

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,800
Huh? They-teia are gonna be shocked.

201
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,270
It's a shame but there's nothing we can do.
What's done is done.

202
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,590
The one who just invaded the Whale Forest is probably a pirate, Straw Hat Luffy.

203
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,460
He's their-teia captain but I'm sure the Guardians will show no mercy!

204
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,160
They were killed!

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,640
She said there's a corpse...
Which means they weren't cannibalized.

206
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,960
That's not the problem! Cut it out!

207
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,550
Calm down!

208
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,760
Old "Spiral Eyebrows" is with them.
He won't let anyone be killed.

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,830
Yeah. They're not gonna be killed that easily!

210
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,140
This must be a trick to make us upset and submissive!

211
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,320
You're right. I can't believe it.

212
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,080
Tra-guy-kun.

213
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,840
Your friends must be here, right?  Is there any way to make contact?

214
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,990
No.

215
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,240
I didn't even expect to see them again.

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,940
But now I remember.

217
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,700
I forgot that I had a Vivre Card.

218
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,040
It belongs to our navigator, Bepo.

219
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,900
Oh yeah, you had a talking polar bear in your crew!

220
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,760
Is he a Mink too?!

221
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,020
Yeah.

222
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,990
This is where he was born.

223
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,040
But he didn't remember much about this island.

224
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,710
Because he left the island when he was little.

225
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,910
I've known him for a decade.
We can trust him.

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,600
If you wanna get reliable information, let's head straight.

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, I looked around from up there before!
If we go straight, there'll be a town!

228
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
We don't know who are there!
Are we gonna be okay?!

229
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,980
The cannibal tribe might be there...

230
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,330
It's better than going along with the unknown animal.

231
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,480
Let's follow him.

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,830
Whale Forest

233
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,520
Rubber...

234
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,800
Moo Golova!

235
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,240
Bell!

236
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,080
Why isn't Electro having any effect?!

237
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,980
That's it! Stop right there!

238
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,060
I know him!

239
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,620
Even if you know him, he's an invader!

240
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,830
I guess we gotta stop you by force!

241
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,660
Don't get in our way!

242
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,320
No! Jean Bart!

243
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,680
Damn! This is too much to handle!

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,960
He's too strong!

245
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,100
That's enough, Guardians!

246
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
A fluttering object!

247
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,380
A banana!

248
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,840
Yeah! I got a banana!

249
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,560
Whale Forest Guardian (Bull Mink)
Roddy

250
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,560
Whale Forest Guardian (Gorilla Mink)
 BB

251
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,560
Yum! Yum, yum, yum...

252
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,800
So this is how you handle them.

253
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,980
A dog?

254
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,580
Battlebeast Tribe (Dog Mink)
Wanda

255
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,950
You-teia are Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?

256
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm Wanda.

257
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,870
Battlebeast Tribe (Rabbit Mink)
Carrot

258
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,220
She's Carrot.

259
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,980
We won't do anything to you so stop resisting.

260
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,790
There are a bunch of strange creatures in this country.

261
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,220
It's like having a ton of Choppers.

262
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,780
What's with them?!

263
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,880
I didn't even do anything but they attacked me!

264
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,830
That's because you-teia invaded the forest where you mustn't enter.

265
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,850
Oh! Wh-What are you doing?!

266
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,350
Guardians!

267
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,530
We'll take him out of here!

268
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,440
Please forgive him!

269
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,400
For Wanda's sake...

270
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
Let's retreat, Roddy!

271
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,330
BB!

272
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,070
Pedro!

273
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,080
Everyone, retreat!

274
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,140
Was I surrounded?

275
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,200
Just be thankful this wasn't a moonlit night.

276
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,220
Hey, Straw Hat, don't you remember us?

277
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,260
We took care of you after the Paramount War!

278
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm shocked!

279
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,220
Oh! You're the talking bear from Tra-guy's crew!

280
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,180
Tra-guy?

281
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,100
No, we work under Trafalgar Law!

282
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,800
Navigator of the Heart Pirates
Guardians's helper Bepo

283
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,160
The Heart Pirates!

284
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
That's what I said.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,180
No, you didn't!

286
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,140
Well, we've been reading newspapers!

287
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,000
There was a whole bunch of surprising news!

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,920
We're allied, aren't we?

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,420
Is our captain here too?

290
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,440
Yeah, Tra-guy's here!

291
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
You got it wrong again! Who is that?!

292
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,220
Tra-guy is Law.

293
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,540
Oh yeah? I didn't know that.

294
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,980
So our captain, he's here! Yeah!

295
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,300
Captain, I can't wait to see you!

296
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,150
Center of the elephant's back
Kurau City

297
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,280
I guess there's no doubt that it was attacked.

298
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,880
This city could have as many as several hundred thousand residents but not a single person is here.

299
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,220
We shouldn't be out in the open like this!

300
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,860
The enemies must be around here still!

301
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,940
Is this a device for torture?

302
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,420
We can't even tell whether the enemies are humans or not.

303
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,460
There are so many claw marks.

304
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,250
Yeah, what are those?!

305
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,120
Hey, come see this.

306
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,790
It's a giant footstep.

307
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,000
Do you think it's an elephant?

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,700
Did some monsters and beasts attack the Minks' country?

309
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,680
But looking at those claw marks, it might be internal discord.

310
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,800
One thing is for sure.

311
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,760
This country was suddenly ruined only one or two weeks ago.

312
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,470
Th-Then Sanji and everyone else...

313
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,890
...were involved in it?!

314
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Ruined?

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,300
That's why no one's there.

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,070
This centuries-old country's name is
Mokomo Dukedom.

317
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,440
When I trace my memories back to just a half-month ago, I can see everyone's happy face.

318
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,760
This country was ruined by...

319
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,780
...Jack!

320
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,060
Oh! What is this?!

321
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
What's going on?!

322
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
There'll be a Rain-Ruption!

323
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,700
Climb a tree!

324
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,720
Get on Warney!
I'll take you to the Rightflank!

325
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,500
Your friends are there!

326
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,110
Great! So Sanji and the others are there!

327
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,140
What's wrong?!
