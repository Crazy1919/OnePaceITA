780
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,480
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,870
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,140
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}

800
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,710
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,890
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,700
Duke Inuarashi and Master Nekomamushi

812
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
A mammoth?!

813
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,380
Why's that prehistoric animal here?!

814
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,970
So that's what your enemies wanted, and what you people didn't have?

815
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,180
A warrior from the Land of Wano? Raizo?

816
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,980
We don't know such a person!

817
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,680
D-Don't mess with this country! Get out!

818
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,190
So it was real!
The unknown country of the Mink Tribe!

819
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,800
You silly animals talk a lot!

820
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,660
Identify yourselves!
Who are you-gara people?!

821
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,380
Hmm?

822
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,740
Who do you think you're asking to identify themselves?!

823
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,940
This man right here is...

824
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,350
...the infamous Emperor Kaido-sama's right-hand man!

825
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,580
One of the three henchmen who are called "Disasters"!

826
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,670
Prominent member of the Beasts Pirates
Captain of the Mammoth
Jack the Drought

827
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,660
Jack the Drought-sama!

828
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,020
The land that he passed through...

829
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,900
...will be destroyed -
ruined as if a drought occurred.

830
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,990
Now, hand over Raizo,
the warrior from the Land of Wano, to us!

831
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,440
You don't want your quiet life

832
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,890
Beasts Pirates
Headliner of the Gifters
Sheepshead

833
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
in which you can hold your kid to be threatened!

834
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,540
Or do you wanna fight?! Huh?!

835
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,980
We definitely don't want to fight.

836
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,150
Mon-ji!

837
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,930
However, we need you to listen to us in order to come to an agreement.

838
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,320
We can't hand over someone who isn't here.

839
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Jack-san, we Minks don't lie.

840
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,070
If you want to look for this Raizo,
you can go from door to door...

841
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,640
He has no mercy even for women, children, or elderly people!

842
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,770
Are we here to talk, Ginrummy?

843
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,620
No, Jack-sama.
We're here to capture a samurai.

844
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,790
Raizo is not a samurai, you idiot!
He's a ninja!

845
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,050
Cut it out, Sheepshead-sama!

846
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,440
Samurai is a general term for all kinds of warriors from the Land of Wano! Either way is okay!

847
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,540
Samurai and ninja aren't the same!

848
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,860
I only have one demand!

849
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,960
Bring Raizo here!

850
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,680
So it was Kaido's subordinates who attacked this country.

851
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,640
That's right.

852
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,730
We don't know anyone named Raizo!

853
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,130
Stop asking for the impossible!
We really don't know!

854
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,200
Then, search the length and breadth of the country!

855
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Pleasures!

856
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,710
My boy!

857
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,470
Silly kid! Show them how merciless we can be!

858
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,190
Pleasures

859
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,210
Ouch!

860
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,570
What are you guys doing?

861
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,350
What's with them?!

862
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,180
How pathetic they are!

863
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,350
We have no weaklings in this country!

864
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,840
All of us Minks are born to be gifted fighters!

865
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,760
Even a baby knows how to defend itself!

866
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,400
You-gara people, do you think you can fight all the people in this country?

867
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,980
We even have highly-trained Musketeers whose abilities are beyond words!

868
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,880
If we fight, both of our troops will get hurt!

869
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,960
If you want to look for someone, could you at least have a talk with the duke of our country?

870
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,300
A talk?

871
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,830
I refuse!

872
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,670
Gifters! Come forward!

873
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay!

874
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:43,100
Gifters

875
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,350
What's with their-gara bodies?!

876
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,690
Alright! Destroy the country and find the samurai!

877
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,870
They didn't listen to us at all and the fight began.

878
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,640
The peaceful Kurau City was...

879
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,660
...instantly turned into a battlefield!

880
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,820
Those who could walk helped those who couldn't

881
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,420
and carried them here.

882
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,900
We don't know how they-teia got to this island

883
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,860
or what made them think that the samurai was here.

884
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,820
I bet the mammoth was so big!

885
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,970
Don't get excited!
Now isn't the time for that!

886
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,220
By listening to Wanda-san's story,

887
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,260
you know why I said "samurai" and "Land of Wano" are taboo now, don't you?

888
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,640
You're right.

889
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
What bad people!

890
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,780
So if you use those words, you'll anger them and make them hate you.

891
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,350
So, anyway...

892
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,930
The ninja that Kin'emon was talking about isn't here!

893
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,160
What a letdown!

894
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,190
Ninja?

895
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,880
Bone-Bone Chop!

896
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,440
Chop! Chop! Chop!

897
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,840
By "ninja," you mean a warrior from the Land of Wano?

898
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,480
You-teia, do you know something?

899
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,540
No, no, he definitely didn't say such a thing!

900
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
Oh, "kanja"!
He was asking how the patient is doing!

901
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
{\an8}Note: kanja = patient

902
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,270
Garchu!

903
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,650
It doesn't hurt at all...

904
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,420
And are we almost there at the patient's house?

905
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, I see Duke-sama's sanatorium already.

906
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,690
Thank you for coming with me.

907
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,620
I'll tell you the rest of the story later.

908
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,330
Duke Inuarashi's Sanatorium

909
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,200
We're sorry, Shishilian-sama!

910
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,940
Please forgive us!

911
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,330
Shishilian-sama is raging out of control!

912
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,910
What's going on?

913
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,300
Shishilian-dono! What's the matter?!

914
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,760
Oh, Wanda!

915
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,650
They-gara kept saying sweet things...

916
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,980
...so I just pushed them off the cliff!

917
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,660
Captain of Duke Inuarashi's Musketeers (Lion Mink)
Full Power Shishilian

918
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,660
Generosity!

919
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,660
Love!

920
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,360
Romance!

921
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,360
Babies!

922
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,490
Sugar!

923
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,300
Honey!

924
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't ever talk about sweet stuff
in my presence!

925
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,450
Or I'll bite out your windpipe!

926
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,660
Now, climb up here without help!

927
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,460
He's so generous!

928
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,320
What did you just say?!

929
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,350
What?!

930
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,460
How could you talk about such sappy stuff like love or generosity so soon after I told you not to!?

931
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,960
But still, he's cool...

932
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,470
We're sorry!
We'll never say anything sweet again!

933
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,190
All right then!

934
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,380
Shishilian-dono.

935
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,240
What?!

936
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,210
They-teia are the Straw Hats.

937
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you for saving my country!

938
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,220
I'll be indebted to you forever!

939
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,100
Shishilian-dono puts all his power into everything.

940
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,000
What an annoying lion.

941
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,160
The duke is expecting you!
You can go in! Hurry up!

942
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,920
Luffy and everybody!

943
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Mokomo Dukedom   Day Ruler   Duke Inuarashi

944
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Duke-sama! I'm glad that you're okay!

945
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,370
So you-gara people are the Straw Hats?

946
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,160
You saved us in every way.

947
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,330
Thank you very much.

948
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,380
I heard my crew saved your people but I haven't gotten to hear the whole story yet.

949
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,660
Well, you-gara and the rest saved us too, Straw Hat Luffy-kun.

950
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,840
Anyway, I bet you're strong!
I mean, really strong!

951
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,580
What?! That's rude!
Duke-sama is the mightiest warrior in the country!

952
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,950
Hey, stop.
That's not what you call a loser.

953
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,610
You're not a loser!

954
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,740
The enemies were surely troublesome but we had the upper hand!

955
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,180
It was...

956
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,500
...a poison-gas weapon.

957
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,240
Gas?

958
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,490
That's right, Luffy.

959
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,460
This country was ruined by Caesar's poison-gas weapon!

960
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Caesar created the weapon and Doflamingo trafficked it and it made it all the way to Kaido!

961
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,800
Caesar!

962
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,700
He's drooling!

963
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,200
I know how you feel! He-teia saved us too!

964
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,790
What a delicious-looking savior.

965
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,560
You're not fully recovered yet so...

966
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,700
not now.

967
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,330
Not now or ever!

968
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,980
Well, let's not talk about the loss.

969
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,180
You-gara, that straw hat looks quite good on you.

970
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,040
I was once...

971
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,480
Oh, I can't remember who it was!

972
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,970
That cat...

973
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,260
Master Nekomamushi.

974
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,450
I was once traveling across the seas with that one.

975
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,920
Shanks who is one of the Four Emperors now was wearing that kind of hat then.

976
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,200
What?!
Old man, do you know Shanks?! How?!

977
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I got this hat from him and...

978
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,620
He fell asleep!

979
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,130
It's already six o'clock.

980
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,310
It's only six! He's not a kid!

981
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,910
Hey, wake up!

982
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,890
Like I mentioned earlier, the Mokomo Dukedom is governed by two rulers all the time.

983
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,390
Duke Inuarashi is the official ruler but...

984
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,320
Master Nekomamushi who guards the old sacred Whale Forest possesses the same right.

985
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,050
What does it have to do with him falling asleep?!

986
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,010
I said "Stop"!

987
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,140
They really don't like each other.

988
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,380
When they come face to face,
they might try to kill one another.

989
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,570
Kill one another?!

990
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,640
Why?!

991
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,330
I don't know why.

992
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,060
I heard they used to be best friends.

993
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,000
But they're both well-respected kings, even if they fight, it'll be an equal match.

994
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,420
They had too many fights and they don't even wanna face each other now...

995
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,330
So one of them, from six in the morning
to six in the evening with the sun

996
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:09,060
and another from six in the evening
to six in the morning with the moon.

997
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,430
That's how they split their living hours.

998
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,220
They hate each other that much?

999
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,270
I didn't realize the doctors were sleeping too!

1000
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,360
All of the people in this fortress should be sleeping now.

1001
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm getting tired. Grr...

1002
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,120
You are...

1003
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,190
Shishilian! Always at full power!

1004
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,440
You don't have to yell! I hear you!

1005
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,170
The day-and-night shifts are affecting us too.

1006
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,500
The people of the city are active during the day.

1007
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,200
And the people of the forest...

1008
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,370
...are nocturnal...

1009
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Find him!

1010
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,010
I know Raizo is in this country!

1011
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,490
Stop!

1012
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,900
Don't destroy the city anymore!

1013
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,320
If nothing is done...

1014
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Where's the samurai?!

1015
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,870
I don't know! I really don't know!

1016
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,430
Then, go to hell.

1017
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,850
Here come the Musketeers!

1018
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,970
Great! Let them-gara handle it!
Everyone else, just step back!

1019
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Minimize damage!

1020
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,000
The Musketeers

1021
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,400
Try to disarm them!

1022
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Yes!

1023
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,340
Let's go!

1024
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,020
Okay!

1025
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,900
What's wrong with them-teia?
So creepy!

1026
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,950
There are some odd warriors here.

1027
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,070
Is that a race we don't know?!

1028
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,050
They-teia have strange abilities!

1029
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,020
Watch out for those with black horns!

1030
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,050
Wolf Grip!

1031
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,190
His hand turned into a wolf!

1032
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,160
Go to hell!

1033
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,080
Wanda!

1034
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,060
You-gara, step back!

1035
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,870
Shishilian-dono!

1036
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,050
The Three Inuarashi Musketeers

1037
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,420
The Three Musketeers!

1038
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,100
All available Musketeers,
lead the citizens to the forest!

1039
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,490
Yes!

1040
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,160
Who are they?!

1041
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,790
Duke Inuarashi!

1042
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,820
You're Jack, aren't you?

1043
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,900
Stop this vandalization and violence now!

1044
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,900
You must be the ruler of this country!

1045
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,540
What?!

1046
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,980
Duke-sama!
Why did you drop your sword?!

1047
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,860
We're not gonna resist!
You can search the country or the island...

1048
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,500
...for that samurai, all you want!

1049
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,740
So stop the destruction!

1050
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,480
This country has a glorious history!

1051
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,010
I refuse!

1052
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,120
Duke-sama, run!

1053
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,390
Duke-sama!

1054
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,750
Whoa-whoa! What's with that dog?!

1055
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,300
He withstood Jack-sama's attack!

1056
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,840
That's our Duke Inuarashi!

1057
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,380
I didn't know they had such a strong guy!

1058
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,780
I thought this was a fairyland of fuzzy animals!

1059
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,100
Screw you!

1060
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,040
Our boss, Jack-sama is a great pirate renowned throughout the New World!

1061
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,910
The bounty on his head is...

1062
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,720
...one billion belly!

1063
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,970
So just because you're a little strong,
don't think you can push your luck!

1064
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,720
This underling sure is obnoxious.

1065
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,280
Please!

1066
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,060
It's a false accusation!
We're not hiding the samurai!

1067
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,510
Let me make it clear!

1068
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,860
We'll call off our attack as soon as we get the samurai!

1069
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,610
If you don't have him, it's your own fault!

1070
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,280
That doesn't make any sense.

1071
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,300
Let me tell you one more thing.

1072
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,760
I like destroying stuff.

1073
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,260
This is certainly a disaster!

1074
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,140
Kill them all!

1075
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,930
Let's go!

1076
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,520
What an unbelievable amount of rainfall!

1077
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,900
Don't be intimidated by such rain!

1078
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,240
That's Master Nekomamushi's roar!

1079
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,810
The Fool of the Night woke up!

1080
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,850
Let's retreat, Musketeers!

1081
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,840
What?!

1082
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,850
Aren't we gonna fight with them?

1083
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,880
No, the day-and-night shifts are working.

1084
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,460
We can stay on the offensive without giving them a break.

1085
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,590
You're right!

1086
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,850
Jack!

1087
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,290
Don't think you-gara are the only unreasonable man here!

1088
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,400
Anywhere you go, you can find a fool!

1089
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,180
{\an8}Amulet: protect

1090
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,580
It's my country when the moon is up!

1091
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,760
I won't let any invaders get away!

1092
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,130
The Guardians

1093
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,240
Don't think you can get out of here alive!

1094
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,220
It's giant!

1095
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,440
A cat monster!

1096
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,320
Jack-sama!

1097
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,380
Master, the city is...

1098
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,060
Never mind! I heard what's going on.

1099
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,020
You came looking for a warrior from the Land of Wano, didn't you?

1100
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,810
I wouldn't let any samurai step onto the island!

1101
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:47,040
If they come in,
I'd be the first to bite them to death!

1102
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,490
I'm Nekomamushi!

1103
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,360
The man who waits for the dawn of the world!

1104
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,920
Warden of the Whale Forest
Night Ruler
Master Nakomamushi

1105
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,900
Jack-sama!
