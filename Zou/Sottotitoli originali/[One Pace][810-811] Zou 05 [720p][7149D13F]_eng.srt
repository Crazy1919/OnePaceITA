780
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,480
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,870
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,140
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100

785
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,100

786
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100

787
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100

788
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,100

790
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,340
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}

800
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,470
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,710
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,890
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,440
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,680
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
The Curly Hat Pirates Arrive

812
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,200
1,000,000 BELLY

813
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,830
It must be the ancient version of the Elephant Fruit. You ate such a rare fruit!

814
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
They've still got this many soldiers.

815
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,540
You should've withdrawn while the dog was treating you nicely!

816
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,400
Master!

817
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,380
We have just as many soldiers as some major countries!

818
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,990
Bepo!

819
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,980
You-gara guys are still under my care!

820
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,630
You don't need to fight!

821
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,070
It's not gonna work that way, Master!

822
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,140
Although I became a pirate, this is still my home!

823
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,480
To us...

824
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
It's our friend's home!

825
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't speak as if you're full-fledged.

826
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,130
I'll destroy everything!

827
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,180
We'll fight back!

828
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,020
It's already morning!

829
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,120
Haven't you given up yet, Jack?!

830
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,480
We rotated our combatants by day and night...

831
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,580
and continued fighting for two days, three days, four days, and so on.

832
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,800
But Jack's reinforcements kept coming from the sea and we could hardly fend them off.

833
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,740
It was like fighting a wave of countless zombies!

834
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,760
However we were steadily overwhelming the enemy!

835
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,290
I can say there was only one that we couldn't bring down and that was...

836
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,990
...Jack!

837
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,230
He is, indeed, a monster!

838
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,930
Hmmm.

839
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,960
The guy who even this old man couldn't beat was Kaido's subordinate.

840
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,970
Unbelievable!

841
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,990
But the enemy was having a hard time too.

842
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,540
I think Jack got tired of the two rulers who he couldn't take down

843
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,060
so he finally brought out a weapon on the fifth day!

844
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,020
It was...

845
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,230
...a poison-gas weapon.

846
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
It all happened so quickly.

847
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,520
The deadly gas was filling the whole country at the speed of a blast wave!

848
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,800
How could anyone escape that?!

849
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,900
The gas filled up the whole city and half of the forest and totally paralyzed us.

850
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,060
Except for the people who evacuated to the back of the fortress, nearly everyone was incapacitated.

851
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,220
I don't even want to remember...

852
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,450
...what happened after that!

853
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,480
Answer the question!

854
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,890
Where's the warrior from the Land of Wano?

855
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,760
He's not here!

856
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,350
They kept asking questions they knew the answer to!

857
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,280
Then they brutalized our soldiers and ruined our country!

858
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,630
Then, they found Master Nekomamushi and the Guardians who were paralyzed by the gas...

859
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,300
...and did the same to them.

860
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
But when they saw they weren't getting anywhere...

861
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,910
Our tough ones were crucified...

862
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,200
...and tortured.

863
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,700
Where's the warrior from the Land of Wano?!

864
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,970
I don't know!

865
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,750
We wouldn't hide anyone like that!

866
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,020
Please stop...

867
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,760
No one in this country knows anything about that!

868
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,630
We're really dying for nothing! You have no mercy!

869
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,550
I won't let this go even if I die, Jack!

870
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,780
Until the day I curse you-gara to death with my cat-grudge!

871
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,700
Those tragic events lasted one whole day... and on the sixth day...

872
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,100
maybe because Jack was satisfied with the destruction or tired of hearing the same answer...

873
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,870
he left a few dozen of his men behind and departed from the island.

874
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,280
That's too awful!

875
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,030
There was no salvation.

876
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,320
No, that actually saved us too.

877
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,060
Oh, you were up!

878
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,120
I noticed that when I read Jack's obituary in the newspaper.

879
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,940
Jack dies!

880
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,940
The prominent member of the Beasts Pirates

881
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,940
"Jack the Drought"

882
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, so this is Jack.

883
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,620
The day you-gara people took down Doflamingo,

884
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,300
Jack left this country.

885
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,660
He left here to go save Doflamingo.

886
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,980
I guess they had some sort of a deep connection.

887
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,410
So the ones who drove that monster out of here were...

888
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,940
...you-gara people.

889
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,450
He fell asleep again!

890
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,250
I see!

891
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,400
Given all that, I'm even more grateful to you all and feel it was truly a miracle!

892
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,130
We arrived here the very next day after Jack left!

893
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,890
Is that...

894
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,260
...Zou?!

895
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
I warn you!
I don't like the idea of landing here!

896
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,370
You bastards!

897
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,630
Shut up and keep going!

898
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,890
Damn! I'll get even with you buttholes!

899
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,100
Is that...

900
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,440
Sanji-kun!

901
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,980
The gate is...

902
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,400
Seems like it was broken open with tremendous force.

903
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,360
There was obviously an invasion!

904
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,940
A-An invasion?!
Are they our enemies too?!

905
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,860
Brook! Look after Nami-san here. I'll go check inside.

906
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,420
No problem.

907
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,300
I-I'll look after Onami too!

908
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
Chopper! Caesar! Let's go!

909
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,690
Why should I go along...

910
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,730
Shut up and get moving!

911
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,780
See you later!

912
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,170
Don't take too long!

913
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,300
It looks abandoned.

914
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,370
There's no guard or gatekeeper. What happened?

915
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,270
Somebody, help!

916
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,640
Wh-What is it?!

917
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,650
What?!

918
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,320
Was she the one who talked?!

919
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,920
What's going on?!

920
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,860
Oh, he definitely looks like a villain!
That means she is a victim!

921
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,740
This way!

922
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,160
Wait, you little squirrel!

923
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,550
We just wanna crucify you and ask some questions!

924
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,800
Who are you guys?!

925
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Brook! Can you handle them?!

926
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Okay.

927
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,000
Go!

928
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,590
Soul Parade!

929
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,440
Ice Burn!

930
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,470
Yes!

931
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,400
Good job, Bonekichi!

932
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
Thank you, Brook!

933
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,260
A talking skeleton and eel!
I'm scared!

934
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,280
Wait! Hey, you!
What's happening on this island?!

935
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,890
What's going on here?!

936
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
It's filled with gas.

937
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,470
Are those all animals on the ground?!

938
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,460
Idiot! They're the Mink Tribe!
Don't you know?!

939
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,130
Anyway, let's go back to the forest for now!
We'll be killed by the gas!

940
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,820
Hey, you-gara people...

941
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,580
Tsk! Seems like they're still alive.

942
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,240
You're not their-gara's allies, are you?

943
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm Pedro! Will you help me?

944
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,900
Please!

945
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,400
Duke Inuarashi and Master Nekomamushi need to be treated as soon as possible!

946
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,980
Otherwise, they're going to die...

947
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,240
The world is waiting for them.

948
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,260
Those two men...

949
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,920
We shall never ever...

950
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,060
...let them die!

951
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,250
Zou, 10 days ago

952
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,970
Boy! I can't believe it!

953
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,770
The whole country has been ravaged by the poison gas!

954
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,680
I got the chills seeing its power!

955
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,410
What's so funny?!

956
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,200
The name of the gas is Koro!

957
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,220
It's a weapon of mass destruction that I invented!

958
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,780
What did you just say?

959
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,690
I said that gas was made by me...

960
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,820
What?! Why should I take the blame?!

961
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,750
I'm not the one who used it!

962
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,500
This guy is the worst!

963
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,330
If you hadn't made it, no one would've fallen victim to it!

964
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,890
I'm sure you can neutralize it with your ability!

965
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,010
Do it now!

966
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,550
Then, make an antidote!
It's not too late yet!

967
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,230
Considering how much it cleared away, more than a day has passed already!

968
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,880
Not again!

969
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,700
Hey! Don't think the underdogs are always good!

970
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,430
The Mink Tribe is known for disliking humans and their great fighting strength!

971
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,050
Leave them alone for your own good!

972
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,320
They'll bite us to death as soon as we save them!

973
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,110
Bite us to death?

974
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm losing my power...

975
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,780
It's salty! It's seawater!

976
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,980
Chopper!

977
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,910
Couldn't you save me a little more gently?!

978
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,580
Stop complaining after I saved you!

979
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,720
That's Nami-san's voice!

980
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,620
Listen, Caesar!

981
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,600
Get the poison gas you created out of the city before I come back!

982
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,270
What?!

983
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,960
Otherwise, I'll crush your heart here in my fist and...

984
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,220
Alright! You devil!

985
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,400
Sanji, leave him in my hands.

986
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,440
Yeah, thanks!

987
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,750
There she is!

988
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,900
Brook!

989
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,680
Keep stalling him like that!

990
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,400
Huh?!

991
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,740
Diable! Mouton...

992
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,740
{\an8}Devil Mutton

993
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,840
Shot!

994
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,160
Sheepshead-sama!

995
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,040
Guys! Retreat!

996
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,480
Sheepshead-sama has been taken down!

997
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,560
What?!

998
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,540
But we haven't found the samurai yet!

999
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,590
Although we cornered them this far, he didn't show himself!

1000
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,150
The samurai's not here! Tell him so!

1001
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,180
Yes, ma'am!

1002
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,040
Do it! Neutralize the gas!

1003
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,150
How annoying. All right. I'll do it! Are you happy now?!

1004
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,340
Koro-neutralizing gas!

1005
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,790
This is so against my will!

1006
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Roko!

1007
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,250
Okay, it's good!

1008
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey! Guys!

1009
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,230
Get over here now!

1010
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,450
That's Chopperemon!
From the forest down below!

1011
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,470
Let's go now! There's no time to lose!

1012
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,620
Th-This is awful!

1013
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,560
Were they all killed by Caesar's weapon?!

1014
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,220
Yeah. Most of the people have been wiped out.

1015
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,990
It must've been done by those fools from earlier.

1016
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,440
You mean those people who just attacked us?

1017
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,260
Seems like Caesar neutralized the gas successfully...

1018
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,200
But they've done so much damage.

1019
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,670
So there is a chance that a lot of them are still hiding somewhere on the island.

1020
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,880
According to the gas idiot, the Mink Tribe is a savage race.

1021
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,700
We might end up regretting that we saved them but...

1022
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,440
Are you-teia guys Jack's allies too?!

1023
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,020
Nami-san!

1024
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Wait! It's okay!

1025
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,780
She's weakened by the poison!

1026
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,210
Nami-san! She has an explosive!

1027
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,320
What?!

1028
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll never forgive you-teia people! Never!

1029
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,680
What did we do to you?!
What do you gain from killing us?!

1030
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,620
The person you-teia are looking for isn't here!

1031
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,560
This country has a millennium-long history!

1032
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,780
How much do you have to destroy to get your fill?!

1033
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,350
Wanda-san!

1034
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,140
Those-teia people saved me!

1035
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,590
Tristan!

1036
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,820
All of Jack's subordinates have just
left the island!

1037
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,740
What? Left?

1038
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,360
Did they-teia?

1039
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,300
Pedro!

1040
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,440
Wanda...

1041
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,560
They-gara have nothing to do with Jack.

1042
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,440
The poison gas has just cleared away from the city...

1043
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,040
...because of their-gara magic.

1044
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Come to think of it, the gas is gone.

1045
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,900
You-teia people...

1046
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,650
Who are you?

1047
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,420
What are you guys doing?!

1048
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
Chopper!

1049
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,190
More than a day has passed since the gas was released!

1050
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,900
To counteract this gas, we have to give the poisoned ones

1051
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,830
the antidote within 48 hours or it'll be too late for them!

1052
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,900
What's that?

1053
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,750
What?

1054
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,860
To save everybody in the country, we can't even waste a second!

1055
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,040
Where is there a hospital?! I need more instruments and medicine!

1056
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,710
Bring everybody who can help here!

1057
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,220
I'm a doctor! Do as I say!

1058
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,380
Are you going to... save us?

1059
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,260
I thought we were going to die... All of us!

1060
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,400
We won't give up on anybody!

1061
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,280
I'll play some soothing music.

1062
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,910
You didn't even know who we were!

1063
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,850
But you saved us without giving up.

1064
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,090
We'll never forget what you did for us!

1065
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,960
We'll pay our debt to you someday!

1066
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,290
No, no! You don't have to do that!

1067
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,950
You guys did such a nice thing!
I'm so proud of you!

1068
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,120
I can't believe it was that serious...

1069
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,490
Now I understand why we were so welcomed.

1070
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,950
Anyway, that Jack guy makes me mad!

1071
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,500
I'll kick his butt as well as Kaido's someday!

1072
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,710
But he said there was an obituary...

1073
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,450
Well, it's hard to believe if you had seen him with your own eyes.

1074
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,980
Guys, will you stay here and talk?

1075
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,240
Are you gonna go somewhere, Chopper?

1076
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,190
It's night now so I'll go examine Nekomamushi, the King of the Night, and the Guardians of the Whale Forest!

1077
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,430
Oh, I'll take you there with my Warney.

1078
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,010
Come to think of it, Wanda,
isn't it time for you to sleep too?

1079
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,370
I work as a Kingsbird.

1080
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,890
A Kingsbird?

1081
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,930
Yes - an aide to the kings and the only office that is

1082
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,850
allowed to go back and forth between them regardless of whether it's day or night.

1083
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,790
Wow, that's an important job!

1084
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,820
I have to tell him that Duke Inuarashi is okay.

1085
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,440
He'd probably say it's unnecessary.

1086
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,590
I'll come with you!
I wanna see Nekomamushi!

1087
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:26,340
Master Nekomamushi! I like him so much! I'll come with you!

1088
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,070
It's a full moon tonight but I'm glad that it's covered by the clouds.

1089
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,450
Be careful!

1090
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay!

1091
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,950
Thank you, Carrot, for giving us a ride.

1092
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,110
That's okay. I'm a Kingsbird too.

1093
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,370
Anyway, Wanda, so far in your story...

1094
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,730
Yeah, both Twirly Eyebrows and Gassy hadn't left yet.

1095
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,670
Let me tell you what happened to them.

1096
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,770
The thing is we didn't tell that many people in this country about this.

1097
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,180
We didn't want to make the people who had their country ruined worry more.

1098
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,990
This was a big event that happened secretly just two days ago.

1099
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,730
Please be prepared for what you're going to hear.

1100
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,150
Sanji-san might not...

1101
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,700
...come back to us.

1102
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,900
What?!

1103
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,020
Whoa-whoa.

1104
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,450
Why, Brook?!

1105
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,840
It says "I'll be back" in his note!

1106
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,750
I told you it's actually more complicated!

1107
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,170
He will be back! I believe in Sanji!

1108
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,500
Okay, okay, please relax, Luffy-san.

1109
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,870
I'll tell you what happened from the beginning.

1110
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,730
Uh-huh!

1111
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,750
This island of Zou that we're on is the Phantom Island.

1112
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,330
Because the island itself is a living thing, you can't get here even with a Log Pose

1113
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,530
or find it in a normal way.
But...

1114
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,100
We made a blunder and had a blind spot.

1115
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,440
First, at that time...

1116
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,970
You go ahead and sail for Zou!

1117
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:27,150
We allowed the enemy ship that we'd shaken off to know our destination.

1118
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,190
Second, someone from the Phantom Island was on their ship.

1119
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,510
So the ones who showed up in front of us two days ago were...

1120
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,430
...Emperor Big Mom's pirate group!

1121
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,640
Clank.

1122
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,550
We arrived.

1123
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,310
Yeah, no problem. Count on us, Mama.

1124
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,610
The two of us can finish this.

1125
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,980
Zou is where I came from! Grr!
