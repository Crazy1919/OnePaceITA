780
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,770
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,040
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,240
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}

800
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,790
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,580
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200


812
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,500
Zou

813
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,500
Dressrosa

814
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,130
Royal Palace

815
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,130
I can't find any of the manifests they used for trafficking,{\an8}

816
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,340
but it was all clearly stolen by somebody.

817
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,590
I thought so.

818
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,220
All the weapons and explosives that were left behind were stolen after the incident.

819
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,560
There was quite a bit, too.{\an8}

820
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,310
Cipher Pol, Aigis Zero

821
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,760
The handiwork of some organization, surely.{\an8}

822
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,310
The Navy was panicking about it as well.{\an8}

823
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,310
The Revolutionary Army, perhaps?

824
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,750
Yeah, who else would it be?
Return at once.

825
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,030
They're thorns in my side, I swear.

826
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,450
You're absolutely right, boss!

827
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,960
Just like you, as a matter of fact.

828
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,080
Wow! That's harsh!

829
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,620
So where are you heading to next, Straw Hat?

830
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,900
{\an8}This was a land of tragedy.

831
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,480
{\an8}Dark strings were woven, one after another.

832
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,690
{\an8}Despite the countless tragedies that befell them,

833
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,660
{\an8}they manage to hold back their tears for now,
and music plays on...

834
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,600
Oh, yeah!

835
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,280
{\an8}Music that rings out to the rhythm of clapping hands.

836
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,260
{\an8}The curtain is drawn after the long, sad,
nameless performance without fanfare.

837
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,930
{\an8}Then, words of truth reach the ears of the audience.

838
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,270
{\an8}Their king has returned,
and with peace in their future, all is well.

839
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,960
I have a proposition for you all.

840
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,340
Um, thank you for the introduction.

841
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,490
I am the Tontattan Chief, Gancho!

842
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,350
Standing next to me is my daughter.

843
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,720
I am Mansherry!

844
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,340
So cute!

845
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,140
You want us to make this, Leo-kun?

846
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,220
That's right!

847
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,390
We're counting on you!

848
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,550
The world conference, the Reverie, is this year.

849
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,780
It will be here before we know it.

850
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,430
And it seems like every country has already begun their preparations.

851
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,420
Father!

852
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,660
Rebecca said she's coming over to cook for us this afternoon.

853
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,620
Oh, is that so? What about Kyros?

854
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,500
He's coming too, of course.

855
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,000
I see, I see. It's been so long since we've dined...

856
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
as a family.

857
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,390
{\an8}Visitors to this kingdom will be shocked by a certain sight.

858
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,380
Ham, please!

859
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,860
Oh, hello there,

860
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,160
Rebecca, Mansherry!

861
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,540
{\an8}They are blending in with the town,

862
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,060
{\an8}living side-by-side with humans.

863
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,100
Hey, hey.

864
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,160
We haven't even rebuilt our own homes yet!

865
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
No, no! This is priority number one!

866
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,440
{\an8}Visitors will be amazed at the sight of these adorable gnomes.

867
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,450
{\an8}This is the kingdom of love, passion, and fairies...

868
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,640
You're right. The statues come first!

869
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,850
Darn right!

870
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,700
{\an8}... Dressrosa.

871
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,840
When we're finished transporting our prisoner,
I'll be going on a journey.{\an8}

872
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,410
Naval Fleet

873
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,410
A journey, you say?{\an8}

874
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:57,830
Without the heads of Straw Hat and Law,
I cannot set foot in a Navy base, so...

875
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,380
So stubborn...

876
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,590
If you'd just apologize,
Sakazuki can save face.

877
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,220
No!

878
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,930
And why not?

879
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,060
I have my own honor to save as well.

880
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,980
For crying out loud...

881
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,490
Fujitora...

882
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,490
He's an idiot, you know, Tsuru-san.

883
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,870
This was his last chance.

884
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,250
If he'd sided with me and
helped rid me of that bunch of brats,

885
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,380
things wouldn't have ended up this way.

886
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,510
I was holding the reins.

887
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,800
The reins attached to the monsters of the world.

888
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,250
You shouldn't have removed me.

889
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm extremely certain
you'll all come to regret this.

890
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,490
Don't pawn off that pathetic crap on me.

891
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:11,680
There is no "if".
It's insanity to even consider it.

892
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,500
This was the only possible outcome.

893
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,410
You lost.

894
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,300
Oh, how can I ever win against you?

895
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,890
It takes one to know one.

896
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,850
What do you think lies ahead
in the world of pirates?

897
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,960
I'll answer your question with another question.

898
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,320
What do you think those monsters you unleashed will do...

899
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,010
without the "food" I supplied them?

900
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,300
Is there anyone sailing these seas at this moment that's truly at the top rung of the ladder?

901
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,280
Who rules these seas?

902
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,820
Is it one of the Four Emperors of the Seas?

903
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,650
Or the Seven Warlords who cunningly roam these waters?

904
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,190
Perhaps those brats
from the Worst Generation?

905
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,880
Or, no...

906
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,350
Surely it's the Navy, that military force of justice,
that's conquering the seas!

907
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,800
And then there are some strong individuals we must keep a close eye on...

908
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,230
in the Revolutionary Army,
the allies of the people.

909
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,740
The family of "D" has been hiding
within the shadows of history.

910
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,900
When and where will they appear?

911
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,370
Who sides with who?

912
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,370
Who betrays who?

913
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,260
Tell the Celestial Dragons
in the Holy Land of Mariejoa this:

914
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,460
"You will all be brought low, to the very ground!"

915
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,470
It's been 25 years since Gold Roger explored the Grand Line in its entirety.

916
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,590
His arch-nemesis, Whitebeard,
never took the throne.

917
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,850
He merely stood before it and took the reins.

918
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,460
So what happens now?

919
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,860
The number of pirates is swelling,

920
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,930
and there's just one seat
that remains empty!

921
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,200
You understand what I'm getting at, right?

922
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,690
It's beginning.

923
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,630
The greatest struggle for supremacy ever...

924
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,370
in pirate history!

925
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,880
The mast has caught fire!

926
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,170
Put it out!

927
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,480
Are we headed to Impel Down?

928
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,390
I hate to ask, but would you mind delivering the daily newspaper to me?

929
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,640
That way, I won't be bored.

930
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,540
There are four battleships.

931
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,280
But their crew looks insanely formidable.
Are they looking to destroy a country?

932
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,700
So much force for a simple escort mission.

933
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,200
That must speak to
how great Doflamingo-sama is!

934
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,200
It'll be impossible to take back Joker.

935
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,620
Captain Jack, shall we return?

936
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,720
Why?

937
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,710
Huh?

938
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,510
You moron!
We're going through with it!

939
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,510
Huh?!

940
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,520
Who do you think I am?!

941
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,470
Huh?!

942
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,590
Meanwhile, Luffy's Group

943
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,780
Barto Club Pirate Ship
The Going Luffy-Senpai

944
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Does this look right to you guys?!{\an8}

945
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,680
Why does it look like Luffy'd be on this ship rather than ours!{\an8}

946
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,100
Just hearing that makes my day!

947
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,360
That wasn't a compliment!

948
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,660
And now, the thing we're most thrilled about at this very moment...

949
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,420
In the direction this Vivre Card is pointing,

950
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,710
it's the real Luffy-senpai!

951
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Welcome aboard!
Thank you once again for boarding our ship!

952
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,900
Boss, he's glowing so brightly!
I can barely see him!

953
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,230
Me too!

954
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,110
So the whole crew's the same way?

955
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,380
Anyway, it was awful nice of Sabo to make a Vivre Card of me.

956
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,590
Here, I had a Vivre Card made from Luffy, just in case.

957
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,300
Oh? When'd you have time for that?

958
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,090
I'll be taking a piece.

959
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,040
Oh, that's the great Sabo-senpai for ya!

960
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,420
He's so thoughtful and strong! Whatta guy!

961
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,400
I ain't gonna be no follower of yours, but...

962
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,220
I'll take a scrap, just in case.

963
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Bellamy!

964
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,640
We'll help ourselves to some, too.

965
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,480
Well, here's where we part ways.

966
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,570
See ya soon, our boss,

967
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,650
Straw Hat Luffy!

968
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Later, guys!

969
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,520
Man, I had so much fun partyin'!
I think they grew on me a bit!

970
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,290
Bartolomeo, hurry up and take us to Zou.

971
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,990
Who d'ya think yer talkin' to...

972
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,460
We're counting on you.

973
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,220
Aye, aye!
Leave it to us!

974
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,260
Right, you lot!
Set course fer Zou, full speed ahead!

975
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,300
Aye, aye!

976
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,600
I wonder if Sanji and the others ever made it to the island safely?

977
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Nami was with them,
so I'm sure they were fine navigation-wise,

978
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,400
but Big Mom's ship
was hot on their tail...

979
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,820
It's worrying, indeed.

980
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,580
Hey, Luffy.

981
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,110
Our bounties've gone up!

982
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,070
Huh, really?!

983
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,220
Oh, you didn't know?

984
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,580
Well, I've got wanted posters of
the whole crew in my room, so after you, please!

985
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,590
Please!

986
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,040
Alright, I'll go!

987
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,580
Hey, Trafalgar.

988
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,220
I threw yours out already,
but your bounty shot up to five hundred mil.

989
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,940
Oh, thanks. I couldn't care less.

990
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,640
Feast your eyes on them,
if you would please!

991
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,100
You f-framed them?!

992
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,690
The autographs you gave me earlier
are there too!

993
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,730
Well then, let's start with Straw Hat Luffy-senpai!{\an8}

994
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,830
"Me"

995
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,830
"To Bartolomeo"

996
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,830
Kanji for "Sword"

997
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,830
"To Brothers"

998
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,830
"Nico Robin" in Hiragana

999
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,120
His bounty: 500 million belly!

1000
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,030
500 million! Yeah!{\an8}

1001
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,030
"Straw Hat" Luffy
Bounty: 500,000,000 Belly

1002
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,090
Next, Pirate Hunter Zoro-senpai!

1003
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,410
320 million belly!{\an8}

1004
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,620
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro
Bounty: 320,000,000 Belly

1005
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,620
Hey, got any swill?{\an8}

1006
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,940
Demon Child Nico Robin-senpai!

1007
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,040
130 million belly!{\an8}

1008
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,840
"Demon Child" Nico Robin
Bounty: 130,000,000 Belly

1009
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,170
Oh, no. It's gone up.{\an8}

1010
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,430
The Cyborg, Franky-senpai!
94 million belly!

1011
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,820
Short by that much!{\an8}

1012
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,810
"Cyborg" Franky
Bounty: 94,000,000 Belly

1013
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,810
On top of that,
the picture's of the General Franky...{\an8}

1014
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,690
God Usopp-senpai! 200 million belly!

1015
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,190
"God" Usopp
Bounty: 200,000,000 Belly

1016
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,190
I'm unmasked and the price is outrageous!{\an8}

1017
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,780
I'm a marked man!

1018
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,200
But that makes me so happy!

1019
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,070
Still, that picture is awful!

1020
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,760
Hey, screw you!
How did you get your bounty that high?!

1021
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,790
Even my own crewmate's trying to kill me!

1022
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,340
I'm the only one at less than a hundred mil!
It's so unfair!

1023
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,880
Wait, wait a sec! Look closer!

1024
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,420
There're still Nami and the others!

1025
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,930
Black Leg Sanji-senpai, 177 million belly!

1026
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,680
"Black Leg" Sanji
Bounty: 177,000,000 Belly

1027
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh, his poster isn't a sketch anymore!{\an8}

1028
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,700
Tsk! That's boring.

1029
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,520
The last one was funnier.

1030
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,720
Cat Burglar Nami-senpai, 66 million belly!{\an8}

1031
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,150
"Cat Burglar" Nami
Bounty: 66,000,000 Belly

1032
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,150
When the hell'd she
have her picture taken again?!{\an8}

1033
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,380
Cotton Candy Lover Chopper-senpai!

1034
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,200
A hundred belly!

1035
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
"Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper
Bounty: 100 Belly

1036
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
There are no words
that would cheer him up.{\an8}

1037
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,470
The Soul King, Brook-senpai, 83 million belly!{\an8}

1038
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,090
"The Soul King" Brook
Bounty: 83,000,000 Belly

1039
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,090
That's like a poster for his concert!{\an8}

1040
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,820
'Cept for the people who stood out and showed just how dangerous they could be in the recent incident,

1041
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,180
everybody went up by 50 million!

1042
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,960
Ours have gone up by 50 million too.

1043
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,140
But...

1044
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,980
Lookit that fer a sec.

1045
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,740
The bounty on Black Leg Sanji-senpai's head went up by a weird amount,

1046
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,370
and what's written here
is even weirder.

1047
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,330
"Only alive"?

1048
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,700
It's hail!

1049
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,620
They're big! Watch out!

1050
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,470
– Huh?!
– It punched a hole in the deck!

1051
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,340
Luffy-senpai and everybody!
Get inside now!

1052
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,670
What're you talking about?!
We'll help you!

1053
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,920
Which way should we turn?!

1054
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,840
Who's your navigator?!
Give us directions!

1055
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,810
Oh, we don't have a navigator
since we were a land-based gang originally.

1056
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,560
What?!
You're in the New World, you know?!

1057
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,620
Hello, Grandma? It's me, Gambia!

1058
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,700
The thing is, huge hail
just started falling on us.

1059
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,690
Whenever we're in trouble,
we call Grandma in our hometown.

1060
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,030
I see! So she knows about the sea!

1061
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,440
Hey, I got it!

1062
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,710
We have some chewing gum
stuck to the deck, right?

1063
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,790
Yeah, and we didn't know what to do!

1064
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,540
Wrap the hailstone in cloth
and cool the gum to peel it off!

1065
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,800
Alright!

1066
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,340
It came off surprisingly easily!

1067
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,180
We don't need that sort of wisdom now!

1068
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,760
But...

1069
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,310
See! You got hit!

1070
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,640
Apply sugar to his lump, she says!

1071
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,940
Enough with her wisdom!

1072
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,770
Oh no! This ship's gonna sink!
Nami, help us!

1073
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,610
We had so many ships to choose from
but we got on board the wrong one!

1074
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,490
I guess we gotta deal with this ourselves!

1075
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,760
If only we had the Sunny's equipment!

1076
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,410
It's so lively.

1077
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,660
Why aren't you using your barrier?!

1078
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,150
What?! Well, Grandma says,

1079
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,980
"You'll regret it if you defy nature!"

1080
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,300
If you're so scared, get back on land!

1081
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,920
Are they for real?!

1082
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,540
Guys! We have the Straw Hats
who don't even fear god

1083
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,080
and that's like getting help
from a thousand people!

1084
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,890
Our appreciation rains down
like hail and snow pellets!

1085
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,640
How have you guys
survived until now?!

1086
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm so happy!

1087
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,650
You do something too, you fools!

1088
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,040
The A.O. Pirates,
formerly of the Whitebeard Pirates,{\an8}

1089
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,990
Navy Headquarters

1090
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,070
have been wiped out.{\an8}

1091
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,990
Is it that guy again?{\an8}

1092
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,240
Yes, it's the Warlord, Edward Weevil.

1093
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,120
Kizaru (Borsalino)
The Navy HQ Admiral

1094
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,350
How many captains who used
to work under Whitebeard...{\an8}

1095
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,120
... have been brought down?{\an8}

1096
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,580
16 captains, sir.

1097
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,920
Like the other cases, it
seems like they were blown up

1098
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,550
along with the town after
some kind of argument.

1099
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,430
The casualties are about 600.

1100
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,890
He always causes a lot of collateral damage.

1101
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,760
Even though he's the Warlord,
we can't just overlook it.

1102
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,310
What should we do?

1103
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,690
He says he's "Whitebeard" Edward
Newgate's biological son

1104
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,570
and that makes him special but many
people aren't buying it...

1105
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,530
{\an8}Wall Reads as "Unclear Justice".

1106
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,530
Well, it doesn't matter
to us if it's true or not.

1107
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,870
Whoever his father is, he has one sure value.

1108
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,560
As a pirate, he's overwhelmingly strong.

1109
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,680
Pretty much like Whitebeard
when he was young.

1110
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,680
That's the only thing they have in common.

1111
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,400
{\an8}A week after leaving Dressrosa...

1112
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh, it's too foggy. I can't see ahead.

1113
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,520
You guys are getting seasick too often!

1114
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,400
How could you call yourselves pirates?!

1115
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,530
Chewing gum... Chewing gum...

1116
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,070
It'll make it a little better, Grandma said.

1117
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,410
Oh, that's why there is gum
stuck everywhere on this ship!

1118
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,660
What a riot!

1119
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,830
Boss! I see something at two o'clock!

1120
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,860
What is it?!

1121
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,550
In the dense fog,

1122
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,180
there's a mountain or a monster...

1123
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,890
I hope there's no monster
that can be mistaken for a mountain!

1124
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,600
But it looks like it's moving slowly...

1125
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,690
You're just drunk, you...

1126
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,310
If it's a mountain that moves, let's go!

1127
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,410
No, idiot! Anyway, what we gotta do now

1128
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,740
is get out of this foggy
maze as soon as possible!

1129
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,080
Otherwise, we'll hit a reef and capsize!

1130
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,630
Wait, God.

1131
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,020
Did you call me "God"? I'm flattered!

1132
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,620
I'm a man of 200 million and I'm flattered!

1133
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,250
I'm sure even the Navy admirals
are aware of you now.

1134
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,760
Look. The Vivre Card is
pointing towards that.

1135
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh, you're right!
That means your friends are there!

1136
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,890
Usopp, you look sick.
Do you want chewing gum too?

1137
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,520
I've been refusing to face the reality...

1138
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,400
I heard...

1139
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,360
... Zou blocks out invaders
with dense fog and an adverse current.

1140
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,490
There are headwinds too!

1141
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,330
Take in the sails! We'll row it forward!

1142
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,960
Roger that...

1143
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,660
Hey! That's not how you respond!

1144
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,130
Is this the island, Zou?!

1145
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,320
No, that's strange!

1146
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,760
This is no good!
Let's run! Turn it around!

1147
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,010
No, this is it.

1148
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,740
Tra-guy! But this is a zou (elephant)!

1149
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,490
Yeah, Zou is the name of a place

1150
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,500
that flourishes on the back
of a massive elephant.

1151
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,080
What?! Is it alive?

1152
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,340
It keeps moving so it'll never
be at the same location.

1153
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,920
It's a Phantom Island.

1154
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,380
It's not actually an island
so Log Poses won't get you here.

1155
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,680
I've never been here before either.

1156
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,340
It's showing its back to us.

1157
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,940
That means Black Foot and the others
could've gotten here much earlier.

1158
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,040
So we were chasing
an elephant that was walking away.

1159
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,110
Yeah. Get ready to make landfall.

1160
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,530
Can you give us some food?

1161
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,990
For you?!

1162
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,700
Can you give Straw Hat-ya some food?

1163
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,410
Take everything in the food storage!

1164
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,320
So this is Zou!

1165
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,210
There are such unusual
things outside our country!

1166
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,300
I wonder if Momonosuke is okay.

1167
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,880
Hey! I heard there is a
tribe that hates humans.

1168
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,540
Yes, it's the Mink Tribe.

1169
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,880
They hold off humans and people say
the history of their country

1170
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,890
goes back nearly a thousand years.

1171
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,650
A thousand years?!
On the elephant's back?!

1172
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,150
Does that mean that elephant has
been alive for a thousand years?!

1173
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,540
Oh? That's...

1174
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,750
What?! D-D-Don't tell me it's...

1175
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,420
The Sunny!

1176
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,810
Shut up!

1177
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,850
So that's...

1178
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,270
That's...

1179
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,110
... the grand ship that carries
the sacred bodies of the Straw Hats!

1180
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:13,240
The Thousand Sunny-senpai!
I feel blessed! I feel blessed!

1181
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,260
I feel blessed!

1182
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,370
Don't worship it!

1183
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,080
Good! So they made it to Zou for sure.

1184
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,590
I guess they got away
from Big Mom nicely.

1185
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,960
There's no major damage.

1186
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,360
Hey! Sanji!

1187
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,080
Nami! Chopper! Brook! Momo!

1188
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,390
And... what was the gas guy's name?

1189
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,980
All of you senpai,
hurry up and cross over...

1190
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,850
Oh?

1191
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,480
Where did they go?

1192
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,230
Oh! They're already crossing!

1193
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,980
Luffy! Have you seen the others?

1194
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,940
Seems like they aren't here.

1195
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,650
What?!

1196
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,910
I guess they all made landfall.

1197
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,840
Yeah! Let's catch up to them quickly!

1198
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,330
You're coming with us!

1199
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,500
Is there anything else that you need?

1200
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,460
I wish I could follow them

1201
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,520
and see all the stars of the Straw Hats

1202
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,630
from my dreams for even a little while, but...

1203
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,960
... I don't wanna get in the way of
the adventures of those gods!

1204
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,340
Our happiness barometer is
already at full throttle!

1205
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,980
Next time we see you,

1206
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,820
we'll all have abilities that
are worthy of being called

1207
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,350
subordinates of the Straw Hats.

1208
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,690
So if we can help you at that time,

1209
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,610
we want the four other senpai's Divine Drops!{\an8}

1210
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,610
The Divine Drops (Autographs)

1211
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,240
It'll be a sheer pleasure
if we can have them!

1212
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
– Is that an earthworm?
– It's a snake, isn't it?

1213
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,370
It has legs so it's a lizard.

1214
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,750
They're totally ignoring me!
Complete disregard!

1215
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,300
But I'm happy even with that!

1216
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,880
So happy!

1217
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,390
Okay, it's finished!

1218
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,230
– What is this?
– I still think it's a snake.

1219
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,350
I-Is that a snake?

1220
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,340
Appear, Rising Dragon!

1221
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,200
Dragon?!

1222
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,250
What is this?!

1223
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,550
Cool!

1224
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,440
Dragon...

1225
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,000
D-Dragon...

1226
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,240
Some kind of pathetic creature appeared!

1227
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,580
– Why did you...?
– Like they say, an eye for an eye.

1228
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,750
It's cute...

1229
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,300
All right, everyone, cling to its back!
It's gonna climb up!

1230
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,760
Isn't it gonna fly?!

1231
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,890
Okay! Let's go!

1232
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,460
Good! Keep going, Dragon!

1233
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,530
How many kilometers to go?!

1234
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,840
I see no end up there!

1235
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
Are you sure there's a country?!

1236
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,910
Don't worry.

1237
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,030
The Vivre Card is pointing upwards.

1238
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,450
Oh, okay.
Dragon! You can do it!

1239
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,710
Bye, Lome-o and everybody!
Thank you for bringing us here!

1240
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,800
D-Did he just call my name?!

1241
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,100
H-He called my name for the first time!

1242
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,810
I'm happy for you, Boss!

1243
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,440
Y-You too! Thank you very much!

1244
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,610
Please take care on your journey!

1245
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,070
You too! See ya!

1246
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,700
Luffy-senpai! Take care!

1247
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,080
{\an8}Thus, the party keeps climbing up to
the top of the Phantom Island, Zou.

1248
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,350
The Revolutionary Army's General Headquarters
Baltigo. Grand Line

1249
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,430
Dragon-san!{\an8}

1250
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,350
Rebel armies are winning all across the world!{\an8}

1251
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,610
Monkey D. Dragon
The General Commander
of the Revolutionary Army

1252
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,020
The fall of the Donquixote Family
had a huge impact.{\an8}

1253
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,360
This many countries were involved in the weapon trafficking.{\an8}

1254
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,840
The war situation is looking up.

1255
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,320
But tell them not to be too
excited over their win.

1256
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,960
The World Government won't
just sit by quietly.

1257
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,720
Cipher Pol has been
reinforced in recent years.

1258
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,840
So tell them to take extra care.

1259
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,460
Yes, sir!

1260
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,750
Dragon-san.

1261
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,710
They say they found a
special ore in the weapons

1262
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,130
we brought back from Dressrosa.

1263
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,890
An ore?

1264
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,600
Do you know of Drunken Iron Ore?

1265
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,420
It's quite rare
and only a few countries can mine it,

1266
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,150
so they might be able to figure out
where the weapons were actually made.

1267
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,520
Oh, that's good news.

1268
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,440
Yes.

1269
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,610
You brought back our people who
went missing in Dressrosa too.

1270
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,400
You're doing remarkably well.

1271
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,160
Please! I couldn't do it
without Sabo-kun and Luffy-kun!

1272
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,620
How was Robin?

1273
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,410
I heard she was caught in Sabaody,
but that was completely false.

1274
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,290
Yes, it was!
She was totally full of life!

1275
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,580
Almost like...

1276
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,800
Aren't you gonna ask me
about Luffy-kun?

1277
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,280
Well, I've had more than enough with that.

1278
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Oh, I bet Sabo-kun told you a lot.

1279
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,720
Anyway, Koala.

1280
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,640
Yes.

1281
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,310
We need their help.

1282
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,270
Their?

1283
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,230
Summon all the leaders of the Revolutionary
Army from all over the world!

1284
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,360
Okay.

1285
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,030
What?! Do you really wanna summon
all those big personalities again?!

1286
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,040
A Sea Somewhere in the New World

1287
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,130
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1288
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,960
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1289
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,840
Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

1290
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,470
This is Lafitte.

1291
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,680
This... urgess.

1292
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,510
It's me!

1293
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,180
Burgess! It's you!{\an8}

1294
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:58,860
"Demon Sheriff" Lafitte
The Captain of the Fifth Ship of
The Emperor – Blackbeard's Pirate Group

1295
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,140
We went to Dressrosa to pick you up, but you weren't there.{\an8}

1296
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,060
Yeah, sorry.{\an8}

1297
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,980
I couldn't make contact since I was
unconscious almost the whole time.

1298
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,780
Shiliew of the Rain
The Captain of the Second Ship of
The Emperor – Blackbeard's Pirate Group

1299
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,910
Oh, that son of a gun was alive.{\an8}

1300
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,240
Where've you been?

1301
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,740
Where are you now?

1302
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,500
It's all white...

1303
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,750
It's an island as white as snow.

1304
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,760
I snuck onto someone's ship.

1305
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,220
Tell Captain Teach!

1306
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,140
If we invade here now, we can
get a massive amount of weapons!

1307
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,890
It's Commodore Teach.

1308
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,340
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1309
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,380
Make sure to bring Doc Q too!
I'm fatally injured!

1310
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,690
Burgess! Tell us already!
Where are you?

1311
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,440
I don't know the name of the island.

1312
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,160
It's a totally uncharted place.

1313
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,490
Follow my Vivre Card and come here!

1314
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:59,120
Dragon and the obnoxious Sabo are here too!

1315
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,320
I've found it!

1316
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,090
It's the Revolutionary Army's
general headquarters!

1317
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,190
An Island Somewhere

1318
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,780
Everyone's so dumb and ridiculous!{\an8}

1319
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,570
They all say the same thing!

1320
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:40,290
That the members of the Whitebeard Pirates
are Whitebeard's only sons!

1321
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:48,760
Edward Weevil – A Warlord
Self-proclaimed "Whitebeard Jr."
(Former Bounty: 480 Million Belly)

1322
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,750
Mommy! Mommy!{\an8}

1323
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,620
I'm Whitebeard's son, right?!{\an8}

1324
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,760
My beard's white as well!{\an8}

1325
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,400
That's right, dear!

1326
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,220
The Whitebeard Pirates were
just a make-bellyeve family.

1327
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:00,420
You're the only biological son of
the world's strongest pirate, Whitebeard!

1328
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,890
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

1329
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,770
And I'm...

1330
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,240
Miss Bakkin – Weevil's Mother
Self-proclaimed "Whitebeard's Lover"

1331
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,360
... the woman who Whitebeard loved!{\an8}

1332
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,620
So hold your head up, my treasure!

1333
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,740
You're hurting me, Mommy!

1334
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,960
– Look at this!
– What? Is that a mirror?

1335
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,880
No, it's a picture of Whitebeard!

1336
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,800
Oh, I thought that was a mirror.

1337
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,880
You look so much like him, there's
no way you're not his son!

1338
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,760
How can you be so silly?!

1339
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,050
Oh, sorry, Mommy!

1340
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,560
But I forgive you.

1341
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,270
Because I love you!

1342
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,310
Mommy!

1343
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,440
Now, let's go!
Say what you've got to do!

1344
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,500
Ummm...

1345
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,570
I forgot.

1346
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:00,340
Find the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates
like Marco the Phoenix!

1347
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,040
And get something back!

1348
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,100
Your father Newgate must've left
behind a big fortune

1349
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,260
and you're the true heir
since you're his biological son!

1350
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,930
Oh, I see, I see.

1351
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Oh yeah! But what I really
wanna do is get revenge!

1352
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,900
I wanna have my revenge on
Blackbeard for killing Daddy!

1353
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,820
I'll kill him!

1354
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,110
I won't forgive him at any price!

1355
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,000
Silly boy! What's the
point in taking revenge?

1356
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,750
You can't even earn one berry!

1357
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,330
We want money!
You must inherit his fortune!

1358
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
You're right, Mommy!

1359
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,430
What's the matter, Mommy?

1360
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,010
Doflamingo was defeated.

1361
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,690
It's him again! Garp's grandson!

1362
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,730
They say Marco and the others tried
to protect him in the Paramount War.

1363
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,380
Then, maybe he knows something about Marco.

1364
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,150
Should we go beat him up?

1365
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,040
"Buggy Town"
False Brovado Island, New World

1366
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,500
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1367
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,970
– Director Buggy!
– What do you want?!

1368
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,220
We keep getting orders
and the Snails won't stop ringing!

1369
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,180
Good, good!

1370
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,520
Since they can't get weapons
from Doflamingo now,

1371
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,520
they turned to pirate mercenaries
and we're getting a flood of calls!

1372
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,360
We reign supreme over the military market!

1373
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,570
Did you hear that?!

1374
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,530
Hey, guys!

1375
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,660
Whoever finishes eating,

1376
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,210
go to battlefields and run
wild, and bring back booty!

1377
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,800
Your pirating is legitimate
under the name of...{\an8}

1378
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,500
Buggy the "Star Clown" – A Warlord/Pirate
The Director of Buggy's Delivery

1379
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,050
... the Warlord – Buggy
the "Star Clown"-sama!{\an8}

1380
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,730
Buggy's Delivery –
A Pirate Mercenary Agency

1381
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,770
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!{\an8}

1382
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh yeah, Director Buggy!

1383
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,280
I forgot to tell you we got a call from
the S-class mercenary, Hajrudin,

1384
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,990
and he said he wants to quit.

1385
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,940
What?

1386
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,480
Well, it's just one Giant, let it go.
We have four others.

1387
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,740
I mean, all five of them want to.

1388
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,720
What?! They're our biggest earners!

1389
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,000
And we're so busy now!
I wanna know why!

1390
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
No, you don't wanna hear it...

1391
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,900
Say it!

1392
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,590
Say it!!

1393
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,440
I can't see the top yet.

1394
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,920
I wonder how Sanji and
the others climbed this.

1395
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,990
Are they really up there?

1396
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,060
{\an8}The "thing" that Luffy and
the rest are riding is

1397
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,310
{\an8}currently climbing the left
hind leg of the giant elephant.

1398
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,450
It's so high! I'm scared!

1399
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,160
My arms are exhausted! It's too much!

1400
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,410
Don't say that, Usopp.
He's giving it all he's got.

1401
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,460
So cute...

1402
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,040
Kin'emon, Kanjuro.

1403
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,840
Come to think of it, why
do you wanna go to Zou?

1404
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh yeah.

1405
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,430
We owe you people a lot,
so we must tell you everything eventually.

1406
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,220
But first, we need to feel safe.

1407
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,600
Mm-hm. Zou was always our destination
since leaving the Land of Wano.

1408
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,860
We want to see if Momonosuke is okay

1409
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,230
and if another friend we
were separated from at sea,

1410
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,820
Raizo, a ninja, has arrived here safely.

1411
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,660
– A ninja?!
– Is he a ninja?!

1412
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,700
What the...

1413
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,450
A ninja... I wanna meet him!

1414
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,750
Etetetetete...

1415
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,540
Luffy! Look up!
Something's falling onto us!

1416
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,600
Etetetetete...

1417
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,960
What is that?!
