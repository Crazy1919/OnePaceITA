Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,380
So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,750
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,730
"I'm almost there, just a little further and I'll have the answer."

Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

Now let's keep moving forward!

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,360
Always look up!

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,580
Keep your head held high!

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,010
Always step up!

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,930
Fly over the waves!

22
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,500
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,710
Now let's head for the future!

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,150
We drift forward, riding the waves,

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,380
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,610
all under this flag...

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,730
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,300
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,900
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,840
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,740
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,420
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,760
So many obstacles are already behind us!

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,890
Now let's keep moving forward!

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,270
Always look up!

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,580
Keep your head held high!

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,520
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
Now let's head for the future!

{\an5}Luffy and Law's All-out Attack!
The Takeover of the New Era!

42
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,300
Soldiers of Punk Hazard, please listen to me!

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,000
You must be watching this somewhere, aren't you?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,570
You're all being deceived!

45
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,120
Everything Caesar has told you is a lie!  You'll all be killed if you stay here!

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,240
What's he on about?

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,430
Did he go mad after being captured by Straw Hat?

48
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,240
Brownbeard is right below us,
on the first floor of Building R.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,370
According to Master's plan, the Straw Hats and the marines should be there soon.

50
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,610
Should we call Brownbeard up to the second floor?

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Let me tell you who Caesar really is!

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,580
No.  I will go down to him.

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,140
Then we're going with you.

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,210
Caesar!

55
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,770
Oh, my loyal subordinate, Brownbeard!

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,000
You seem to be in a rather foul mood.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,190
What's wrong?

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,630
Return my men to me!

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,500
We were attacked and robbed
at the center of the island, but they weren't dead!

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,170
They should be back here by now!

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,590
Hey, he's provoking Master!

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,550
What?  Oh, Brownbeard's men?

63
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,680
Master, there are marines by the front gate,
and the doors are closed!

64
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,730
We can't get inside!

65
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,950
Please, help us!

66
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,720
I see, that's terrible!  I'll take care of it
right away!  Stay where you are!

67
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,580
Master, how do you plan to let them in?

68
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,380
Just leave them.
Shinokuni will reach them soon enough.

69
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,360
I wonder, what happened to them?

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,250
I haven't heard from them for a long time.

71
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,270
If they haven't returned,
then that must mean they're...

72
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,300
Are you worried?  Well, I guess you would be.

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,550
If they were outside, Shinokuni
would have killed them long ago, after all.

74
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,150
I can never trust you again!

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,300
What's gotten into him?!

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,410
What did he just say?!

77
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,740
You're my friends, too.
We've lived on this island for two years.

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,780
You have to get off the island right now!

79
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,700
Do you know what this man
has been calling you behind your backs?!

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,140
I'll tell you!

81
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,100
This is what he called you...

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,860
Ginnafibs!

83
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,960
Ginnig...

84
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,680
G-Ginns...

85
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,900
What are you saying, Brownbeard?!

86
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,240
Speak up!

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,710
Is that meant to be some sort of spell?

88
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,480
What a funny guy!

89
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,710
Ginnigigg...!

90
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,340
They will continue to obey me,
believing that I am their god of salvation!

91
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,470
They're merely being kept alive
so I can use them as human guinea pigs!

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,560
He called you guinea-pigs!

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,070
What's this?!  My mouth won't move!

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,890
You did something to me, didn't you, Caesar?!

95
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,350
What is it now?

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
What sort of play is this?

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,830
This is a muscle relaxant.

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,770
You can no longer speak, let alone move around.

99
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,730
Oh right.  I just remembered, Brownbeard.

100
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,440
About your former men, I remembered...

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,820
that I abandoned them.

102
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,120
You... damn freak!

103
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,740
How... How dare you kill my men?

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,450
Oh, and while we're on the subject...

105
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,840
I guess I'll tell you one more thing.

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:37,370
The weapon malfunction
that left everyone near death four years ago...

107
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,470
That was my doing.

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It wasn't Vegapunk?!

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,640
So you almost killed them all yourself,
and then just pretended to save them?!

110
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,540
Hey, stop!  You have to stop!

111
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,700
Please help me!  Brownbeard has gone mad!

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,760
This island was made into hell on earth
by Caesar himself!

113
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,940
Run!  He is a devil disguised as a man!

114
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,500
Hey, Brownbeard!

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,550
What are you doing to our savior?!

116
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,950
Oh no!  Brownbeard is dangerous!

117
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,330
We're too late!
Straw Hat must have messed with his brain somehow!

118
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,850
Shoot!

119
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,260
And here comes the killing blow.

120
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,440
Gastan-

121
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,290
Master!

122
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,670
Th-That was close!

123
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,840
It grazed me!

124
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,690
Shit!  Who's there?!

125
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,490
It's Straw Hat... Luffy!

126
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,530
Just like them,
my life was also saved by Master's kindness.

127
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,330
Master is the kind-hearted god of salvation.

128
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,390
Get back to the second floor, my men!

129
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,710
The Straw Hats and the Navy should be here any moment!

130
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,950
Prepare to resume the experiment!

131
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,710
Yes, Sir!

132
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,440
Make sure all our brokers get the footage!

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,540
All of them will probably be dead within five years.

134
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,520
Luffy!  That is him!

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
He is the one
who caused the kind-hearted children to...

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,670
Who caused them to...

137
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,260
I know.

138
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,120
You've tricked everyone here, huh?

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,820
What is this island?!

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,130
Ah, of course.

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,620
This place is like gas or air.

142
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,750
A seemingly non-existent island!

143
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,280
That is why it has such close ties to the underworld.

144
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,750
This is a base of underworld science.

145
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,430
I can perform illegal experiments or obtain experimental subjects.  I'm free to do whatever I want!

146
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,670
I have powerful backers that completely erase everything that happens from the records!

147
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,310
Officially, nothing never happened!

148
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,230
No matter how much you cry or whine, no help will ever come here!

149
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,200
You know nothing about this island, Straw Hat!

150
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,450
If you go off half-cocked and interfere here,
you won't live to tell the tale!

151
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,920
The same goes for your alliance with Law.

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,610
He's trying to interfere with the SAD production.

153
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,450
I'm the only one who can make it, so he's using you to kidnap me.

154
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:14,200
At the factory owned by Donquixote Doflamingo,
the most dangerous member of the Seven Warlords,

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,730
it is transformed into a fruit called Smile.

156
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,870
Smiles are artificially created Zoan-type Devil Fruits!

157
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,210
It's a fruit that anyone seeking strength would want to get their hands on!

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,980
Doflamingo is using the Smiles
to make deals with the big shots in the New World.

159
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,980
I heard that one of the Four Emperors is already using them to form an army of hundreds of Devil Fruit users!

160
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,190
It sends chills down your spine, doesn't it?

161
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,010
Now do you understand what you're meddling with?

162
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,360
Do you see how many big shots you'd piss off by interfering with Doflamingo's business?!

163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,010
If those big shots move against you, the world itself will tremble!

164
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,220
And Law is trying to make that happen.  The fool!

165
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,660
Someone at your level
would be completely obliterated.

166
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You can try to capture me, but I am protected!

167
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,660
By Doflamingo!  By the Four Emperors!

168
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,270
Do you have the guts to pick a fight with them?!

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,900
I've been picking those sorts of fights the whole damn way!

170
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,370
M-Master!

171
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,990
Damn, what the hell do you think you're doing? {Xemnas: He says digijo instead of jikushou so it's a mispronunciation on Caesars part, dunno if you guys wanna put it as a mispronunciation in English or not so I'll just leave it.}

172
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,610
You bastard!  Didn't you listen to a word I said?

173
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,680
Don't think that you'll get away with this!

174
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,700
I have the support... of a notorious lunatic pirate!

175
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,250
One of the Seven Warlords, Donquixote Doflamingo!

176
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,400
He controls the New World's black market.

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,750
Weapons, artillery, drugs!
All dangerous goods have to go through him first!

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,590
In other words, he's the very root of evil...

179
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,870
and connected to every big shot in the underworld.

180
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,180
B-But, if you apologize now...

181
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,980
I'll be willing to forgive your ignorance.

182
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,280
T-Think carefully about all the horrifying monsters
you'll anger by harming me!

183
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,640
Gastille!

184
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,350
Take that!

185
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,700
There it is! {I split this into two lines because the first sentence is said by both of them whereas the second sentence is just spoken by one of them. -Starfish}

186
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,720
His Gas Burner can even melt steel!

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,580
Did he melt?  Or maybe he was blown away?

188
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,700
Th-Th-Th-That's right!

189
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,150
You're a rookie who only just arrived
in The New World, so you might not understand yet...

190
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,060
but there's a monster in this laboratory right now!

191
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,130
It's Vergo!
No one can withstand his Color of Arms!

192
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,960
Both Smoker and Law are going to die.

193
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,510
Your entire crew is going...

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,030
I don't care!

195
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,710
Shinokuni, a deadly gas
that petrifies people and leeches their life,{Excuse me, wouldn't placing a period at the end of this line make it a sentence-fragment? Which, when last I checked, was generally regarded as something to be avoided? -Starfish}

196
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,680
has been leaking into the laboratory.

197
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,100
What are you doing?

198
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,720
We would've caught up to the children already if you just ran in a straight line!

199
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,100
Shut up!

200
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,890
Try and run faster everyone, we have to hurry!

201
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,690
I feel dizzy, like I just woke up from a dream.

202
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,520
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.  It's just an aftereffect from the sedative. {Tsuvian: Reduced because TTR was too long}

203
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,110
Most of the survivors
are heading for the only exit off the island.

204
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,480
Located on the first floor of Building R,
where Luffy and Caesar are currently fighting.

205
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,870
But Kin'emon continues to search for his son,
Momonosuke.

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,260
What a terrible mistake I have made, Momonosuke! {Added "I have made" here because otherwise it looks like he's scolding Momonosuke for making a mistake, when what he's actually getting at is "Momonosuke turned into a dragon. I just killed a dragon! IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIM! D:"}

207
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,030
What?
Momonosuke transformed into a small dragon?

208
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,700
Oh no!  I might have cut down my own son!

209
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,570
Momonosuke!

210
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,360
I have done something unforgivable! {Xemnas: He actually said "I have done something that cannot be taken back", but I went with this translation.}

211
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,330
Kin'emon-san, you mustn't run in that direction!

212
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,430
That area is filling with poisonous gas!

213
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,860
It's a sneak attack!

214
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,350
Why does this always happen to me?

215
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,500
What are you trying to do?

216
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,220
Against a superior Haki user, turning into smoke just increases the size of your body.

217
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,840
It makes you an easier target!

218
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,710
Why do you insist on using your ability?

219
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,580
Have you lost your head?

220
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,640
This fighting style isn't like you at all, Smoker-kun.

221
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,370
Demon Staff!

222
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,860
You may want to punish me for dishonoring the Navy...

223
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,450
but you lack the skill, Smoker.

224
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,410
Bravery alone will not protect your subordinates.

225
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,770
Smoker, thanks for returning my heart.

226
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,910
So that's what you were up to.

227
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,250
My debt to you has been repaid.

228
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,120
Hurry up and defeat him.

229
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,630
You really hated
that you were indebted to a pirate, huh?

230
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,180
It's an embarrassment as a Marine.

231
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,340
I'd never be able to face my subordinates.

232
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,170
Well, I suppose it's true that you helped me.

233
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,570
This is the end for you...

234
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,460
Vergo-san.

235
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,570
You brat,

236
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,740
you finally remember how to speak to your superiors.

237
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,910
If that's what you want to believe.

238
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,990
Don't think that you can stay on your high horses forever, you two!

239
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,450
I know you can hear me, Joker!

240
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,450
Vergo is done for.

241
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,480
You've lost your most important subordinate,

242
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,500
and Caesar will be taken down by Straw Hat.

243
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,370
Which means, you will lose all your SAD.

244
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,710
It was your own overconfidence
that blinded you to this possibility.

245
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,860
Go ahead and look down on us and laugh as usual
while you think of your next move.

246
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,850
But you won't be laughing for very long...

247
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,360
because we're going to keep on surprising you.

248
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,930
You're acting really tough for a little shrimp.

249
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,970
But are you sure you can back it up?

250
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,850
I would suspect...

251
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,890
that you've upset Vergo.

252
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,130
Do you remember what happened last time?

253
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,850
Remember?  Remember what happens when you push Vergo too far?

254
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,460
It must have traumatized you.
There's no way you could ever forget...{Been traumatized you? Really? -Starfish}

255
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,310
the terror that Vergo put into you.

256
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,770
Your cutting ability may be powerful but...

257
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,770
his Haki will easily block it.

258
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,600
You are no match for him,
in neither strength nor position!

259
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,520
It's been two years since the Great War.

260
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,290
Who set what in motion back then?

261
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,060
All you did is protect the position you've grown comfortable in.

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,040
All Whitebeard did was end an era.

263
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,050
Navy HQ has put together a new military force...

264
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,740
but the major players haven't made a move.

265
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,010
It's as if they're preparing for something.

266
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,180
Indeed, that war was nothing but a prologue.

267
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:07,900
You always said that an unstoppable wave is coming.
One that brings a new age for the strong.

268
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,310
I've destroyed the gears.

269
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,570
And now, there's no turning back!
