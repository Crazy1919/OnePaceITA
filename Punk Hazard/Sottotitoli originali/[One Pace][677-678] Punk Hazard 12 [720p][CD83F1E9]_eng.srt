Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,800
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,360
So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,780
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,760

Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,830
So many obstacles are already behind us!

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,880
Now let's keep moving forward!

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,370
Always look up!

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Keep your head held high!

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,030
Always step up!

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,880
Fly over the waves!

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,500
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,740
Now let's head for the future!

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,130
We drift forward, riding the waves,

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,380
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,620
all under this flag...

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,720
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,280
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,910
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,820
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,780
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,460
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,750
So many obstacles are already behind us!

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,910
Now let's keep moving forward!

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,270
Always look up!

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,580
Keep your head held high!

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,970
Always step up!

40
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,790
Fly over the waves!

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,520
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

42
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,040
Now let's head for the future!

43
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:38,760
{\an5}The Counterattack Begins!

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,350
One of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Trafalgar Law.

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,720
A pirate recently reported to have made a full comeback, Straw Hat Luffy,

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,070
and his crewmate, Devil Child Nico Robin.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,690
The Navy's own wild dog, White Hunter Smoker.

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,050
How did Caesar ever manage to get a lineup like that?

49
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,550
Various Places in the New World

50
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,090
Hey, it's them!

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,210
You've finally started moving, Straw Hat.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,210
Eustass "Captain" Kid

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,080
Kid Pirates - Captain
Bounty: 470 million belly

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,870
{\an8}It's pointless to keep watching.

55
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,300
{\an8}Besides, it's not like you to play arms dealer is it, Killer?

56
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,300
Killer

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,110
Kid Pirates - Combatant
Bounty: 200 million belly

58
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,030
Yeah, we all thought that bastard Trafalgar had lost his mind when he degraded himself

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,240
to be the government's lapdog, but it's no surprise that he had ulterior motives.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,210
Is he trying to start something?

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,890
We can't afford to fall behind, we have to hurry!

62
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,890
Kid, please, let's be peaceable.

63
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,630
Shut up, I know that!

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Scratchmen Apoo

65
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,000
Hey there, Captain Kid.

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,900
Basil Hawkins

67
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,050
You look as wound up as ever.

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,910
Scratchmen! What're you doing!?

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,500
You can't just wreck other people's hideouts like this!

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,220
Sorry, Captain! We couldn't stop them!

71
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,160
{\an8}I was just making sure you didn't have any snipers! {Hattori: I LOL'D}

72
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,600
On Air Pirates — Captain
Bounty: 350 million belly

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
{\an8}You'd do the same if an enemy invited you.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,220
See, Killer, this is why I told you not to bring these guys here!

75
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,030
Come on, take it easy, they're powerful men.

76
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,580
Every last one of you...

77
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm gonna kill you all right now!

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,900
Oh, so that's how it is! I'm ready for ya!

79
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,560
Come on! Check it out!

80
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,940
Hawkins Pirates — Captain
Bounty: 320 million belly

81
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,940
This is foolish. I'm leaving.

82
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,780
Wait, Hawkins, don't give up so quickly!

83
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,310
You guys... that's enough!

84
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,150
You're here so that we can talk about an alliance between our three pirate crews!

85
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,200
Can't you guys at least discuss it!?{Sewil is lame}{Yes}{Yes}{Yes}

86
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,670
Counterattack?

87
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,670
Yeah, there's no sense in wasting any more time.

88
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,500
Let's finish this up quickly!

89
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,350
Are any of you able to set fire to things? It's fine if you can't though.

90
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,420
Franky can make fire and shoot beams.

91
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,280
I know! Why don't you melt these chains with your beam?

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,780
I need both of my hands in order to use Radical Beam.

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,760
Right now, all I can do...

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,240
is squeeze out a Coup de Boo from my ass.

95
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,040
Can you set fire to that warship down there on the right?

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,360
That's a simple task for me, bro! Let me handle it!

97
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,020
Franky...

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,700
Fireball!

99
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,190
The ship caught fire!

100
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,010
Run!

101
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,370
What's that Pacifista bastard doing? Is he crazy or just desperate?

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,130
It's no use struggling!

103
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,740
When the experiment is over I'll chop up your corpse and put the pieces to much better use!

104
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,950
I can't see the cage through all this smoke.

105
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,820
Captain-chan, are you alright!?

106
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,380
Smokey, is it smokey up there!?

107
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,590
Dumbass, Smokey's made of smoke!

108
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,990
Dammit, Trafalgar, the smoke's coming this way!

109
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,860
You're the one who did it.

110
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,980
You're the one who made me do it!

111
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,790
What're you playing at!?

112
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,080
Well then,

113
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:08,590
with all this smoke, Caesar won't be able to see us with the video transponder snails.

114
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,910
But it won't be long before we're exposed again.

115
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,230
How the hell did you manage to take off those Sea Stone handcuffs?

116
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,160
Well, I've had ordinary chains from the beginning.

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,790
What!?

118
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,320
It was easy to do with my ability.

119
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,110
Just how many months do you think I've been here?

120
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:35,570
I replaced a set of chains in the lab with normal ones in case there was ever a situation like this.

121
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,160
That way, if I was ever caught, I could switch them and avoid the Sea Stone ones.

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,070
I'm free!

123
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
Alright!

124
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,830
Don't shout, you fool!

125
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,920
Finally, finally free! I am finally free!

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,460
Right then, what shall I do with you?

127
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,880
You know a little bit too much.

128
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,370
Your fate rests with me.

129
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,040
You've already decided what to do anyway! Just get it over with!

130
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,580
You're an adult, what're you screaming like a little girl for!?

131
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,830
Please, just get these chains off me now! I'll do anything that you want!

132
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,540
What're you saying, Tashigi!? How can you even think of appealing to these pirates!?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,440
We have to beg for our lives! If it takes groveling on our knees then so be it!

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,220
If we die here, then we'll be letting all our men die too!

135
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,580
Then Vice Admiral Vergo-

136
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,350
If we allow Vergo to do as he likes, then even more children will...

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,720
Looks like the woman is a little smarter than you are.

138
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,580
Little White Hunter, I have no obligation to save you at all,

139
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,440
but if sparing your lives will put Vergo at a disadvantage then that will benefit me.

140
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,820
However, you'd best forget everything you heard about me and Joker.

141
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:27,940
That is not a request. It's the condition for sparing your lives.

142
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,770
What's goin' on out there?

143
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,760
Alright! I'm finally out!

144
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,260
What're you doing!?

145
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,640
Hey, wait!

146
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,870
He'll just do what he wants if he's out of the cage!

147
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,430
It's not like that chain link stuff is made outta Sea Stone. {Hattori: eh? Franky is damn high or I am? :/ }

148
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
Hey! Trafal-guy!

149
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,060
How do I get inside?

150
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,160
Hey, Bro, I'd rather go and grab the Sunny.

151
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,250
Whatever.

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,870
What's that look for?

153
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,040
Run!

154
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,140
Even if we're running in this strange manner it's still catching up to us!

155
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,710
The dragon's getting further and further away!

156
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,810
We've gotta catch the damn thing and fly away now!

157
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,980
I can't go on!

158
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,550
Sanji-san! Don't give up!

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,630
It's no use, Nami-san's heart and lungs are about to give out!

160
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,160
My chest hurts!

161
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,910
My chest...

162
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,480
I caught him!

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,460
What kind of bizarre power up was that!?

164
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,680
That smoke is closing in!

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,650
With a color that creepy it's gonna be deadly poison for sure!

166
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,590
I'm sorry, Brownybeard, for asking you to carry us while you're so badly wounded.

167
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,210
No problem. It's only like carrying a couple of little dwarfs. Never mind that, I've gotta save my men!

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,750
We've gotta get the kids too! I hope they haven't had any candy yet!

169
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,990
Hey, what's that over there?

170
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,440
Look, there're people being chased by the gas.

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,340
A dragon?

172
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,570
The shutter opened!

173
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,600
This is an emergency!

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,980
The shutters have been raised!

175
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,300
Who touched the lever!?

176
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,210
Dammit! The G-5 marines are flooding in here!

177
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,500
Hey, over there!

178
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,030
It's Vice Admiral Smoker from the Navy's G-5!

179
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,640
One of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Trafalgar Law!

180
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,780
And the pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

181
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,450
But, weren't they all captured by Master!?

182
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,330
Thank goodness, everyone got inside!

183
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Now then, what to do about my heart?

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,090
This is gonna be cool!

185
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,180
I feel pathetic just being near you guys.

186
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,530
What's that?

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,670
Ouch!

188
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,500
Hang on a minute! Wait! Wait!

189
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,340
The shutter's closing!

190
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,390
Dammit, we just got here!

191
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,630
Open it! We've gotta get inside!

192
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,190
It's no use, we're gonna be locked out and killed by all the gas!

193
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,150
It's not too late, we're not dead yet!

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,790
Hey, Kin'emon, can you cut iron?

195
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,620
Nothing can hinder my sword!

196
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,220
Brownbeard, keep going like this!

197
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,080
They cut a hole in the shutter!

198
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,240
Hey, you're all here!

199
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Luffy!

200
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,530
We're back!

201
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,150
Right! Let's go wild!

202
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,130
What've you done!?

203
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,720
This is bad!

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,100
It's great we made it inside, but the poison gas can get in too!

205
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,550
Are you guys serious!? You tryin' to kill us all along with you!?

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,390
Everyone, patch up that hole!

207
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,900
Otherwise we're done for!

208
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,080
It's over!

209
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,440
There's no longer anywhere for life to exist on Punk Hazard!

210
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,120
There're still great clouds of it everywhere.

211
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Just one step outside in this stuff and you'd be done for.

212
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,990
What's it like, Brook?

213
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,040
Well, kinda like a world of death.

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,810
Just imagine if we hadn't patched up that hole.

215
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,540
It makes me shudder.

216
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,050
You make us shudder!

217
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,670
Right, good!

218
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,330
It's not good at all! You thoughtless bastards could've killed everyone here!

219
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,090
And we fixed the hole!

220
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,390
You pirates mess about even more than people say!

221
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,560
Give up now Straw Hat crew! And you too, pirate Brownbeard!

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,060
What!? Now it feels like we're backed into a corner! There's nowhere to run!

223
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,510
Is that even a problem?

224
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,250
Well, this is pretty normal for us.

225
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,540
They should just give up now.

226
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,400
Oh, they knew my name!

227
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,500
Oh, it's kicking off down there!

228
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,130
You two, don't get in the way of his crew and don't get in my way either, understand?

229
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,240
Yeah.

230
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,270
Hey, Trafal-guy, wait a moment!

231
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,770
Over here, over here!

232
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,780
Hurry up! Switch us back!

233
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,070
You don't have to!

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,240
Dammit! My dream is over!

235
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,460
I'm back! But, wait a moment...

236
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,790
Sanji-kun!?

237
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,080
Why is this coat different!? Did you take off my clothes!?

238
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,010
There's more to it than that...

239
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,340
Huh? My body?

240
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,120
This isn't damage from that punch just now.

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,610
Ah, yeah, Nami got your body pretty badly smashed up by Caesar.

242
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,630
What!?

243
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,390
I'm so glad it was my body that got battered instead.

244
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,690
I'm so proud of you! So very, very proud!

245
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,440
Everyone here, listen carefully!

246
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,490
Law!

247
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,760
This laboratory is totally surrounded by poison gas,

248
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,160
but there's a passage that bypasses the outside air and allows for escape directly to sea.

249
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,740
There's a giant door with R-66 written on it, that is the entrance to the passage out to sea.

250
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,970
I'm not a fan of mass murder, so I'll give you all two hours.

251
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,300
Any longer than that and I cannot guarantee the lives of anyone in this laboratory.

252
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,310
Will something happen to the lab?

253
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,140
It's a possibility. Right now, I just have to do what I have to do.

254
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,610
Ah, alright then.

255
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,140
Robin, I have a favor to ask.

256
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,780
What is it?

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,080
G-5!

258
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,910
Smokey!

259
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,650
There're children in this laboratory that were kidnapped two years ago!

260
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,350
We need to take them back and then head for door R-66!

261
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,860
If what he said is true then there's a port straight ahead from there.

262
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,810
We'll steal a ship and escape from Punk Hazard!

263
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,090
Yeah! Let's go!

264
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,840
Let's say goodbye to this island!

265
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,380
The children...

266
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,450
Guys, let's split up and find the children!

267
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,490
Then we can get every last one of them safely into the passageway! It's R-66!

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,750
Zoro, you're not allowed to be alone!

269
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,830
Wait for me, Momonosuke! I'm coming for you!

270
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,820
Alright, I understand.

271
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,130
Thanks! Right then!

272
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,710
Just you wait, Caesar! You're not gonna stop me breathing again!

273
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm gonna batter you and take you hostage!

274
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,120
Tashigi, I need you to lead those G-5 idiots now.

275
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,010
Where're you going, Smoker-san?

276
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,770
Not to face Vergo!?

277
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,620
I won't forgive that guy!

278
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,490
The law doesn't work in situations like this, Tashigi!

279
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,890
I'll do it myself. He's underestimated the Navy!

280
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Please, let me come too!

281
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,720
His... Vergo is insanely strong!

282
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,820
What if something went wrong!?

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,170
Who's gonna protect our men? Help those idiots and the children escape.

284
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,680
Smoker-san.

285
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,770
What? Seriously? Luffy already got beaten by Caesar?

286
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,590
Yeah, we weren't prepared and we wound up suffocating, too.

287
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,140
That bastard is a real pain! Since he's made outta gas he can suck the oxygen out of the air!

288
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,460
We got knocked out by those yetis, too!

289
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,580
This is not good.

290
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,220
Huh?

291
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,810
This is not good at all!

292
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,040
What were those two years for!?

293
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,060
Well, come on, we're both alive so-

294
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,080
This isn't a joke!

295
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,770
If we drop our guard beyond here there'll be no forgiveness!

296
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,450
Hey, Luffy!

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,520
Zoro?

298
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,950
Stop messing around! From here on out this is the New World!

299
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,450
He's pretty tough on himself.

300
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,950
Yeah, sorry! I won't drop my guard again!

301
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,370
It's Straw Hat!

302
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,960
I dunno what he's doing, just take him out!

303
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,160
Rubber...

304
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,710
UFO!

305
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,390
I'm going ahead!

306
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
I said be more serious!

307
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Get outta my way!

308
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,540
Let's go!
