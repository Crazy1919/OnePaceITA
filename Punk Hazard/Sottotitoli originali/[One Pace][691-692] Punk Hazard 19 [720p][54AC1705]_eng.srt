Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,340
So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,750
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,740
"I'm almost there, just a little further and I'll have the answer."

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,650
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Now let's keep moving forward!

Always look up!

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Keep your head held high!

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,040
Always step up!

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,940
Fly over the waves!

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,480
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,730
Now let's head for the future!

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,120
We drift forward, riding the waves,

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,390
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,590
all under this flag...

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,770
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,270
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,910
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,810
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,780
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,470
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,720
So many obstacles are already behind us!

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,910
Now let's keep moving forward!

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
Always look up!

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,560
Keep your head held high!

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,980
Always step up!

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,780
Fly over the waves!

40
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,540
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,990
Now let's head for the future!

{\an5}The Strongest Grizzly Magnum and the Assassins from Dressrosa!

43
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,500
Five minutes are left before the deadly 
Land of Death completely fills the laboratory.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,490
The survivors are racing for Door 66 in Building R,
which is their only escape route, but...

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,250
The ceiling just lifted for a second!

46
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,190
Gas is leaking in through the cracks!

47
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,540
Not good.

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,810
Run!

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,840
But lady, I'm scared!

50
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,030
Hey, this is no time to be freaking out, damn kids!

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,280
Get back on your feet and run!

52
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,250
Captain-chan!

53
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,620
I'm so glad you're safe.

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,630
So you beat the bird-lady, right?

55
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,700
But why are they running toward us from the front?

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,230
I thought they stayed behind to keep the enemy busy.

57
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,670
The G-5 troops are in front of us?

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,100
See?  I told you we were going the wrong way.

59
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,800
Huh?!

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Anyway, please put me down!  This is embarrassing!

61
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,960
Hey you!  Who the hell gave you
permission to carry Tashigi-chan?!

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,310
Zoro, you're running the wrong way!

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,250
Hurry, everyone!

64
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,660
This way!

65
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,970
Building B, 2nd floor - Laboratory

66
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,820
{\an8}The ceiling is collapsing!

67
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,970
{\an8}Chopperer!  This place is too dangerous!

68
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,170
Alright.  I've done everything I can.

69
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,890
Let's hurry to Building R!

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,980
Hang in there, Mocha!  We're getting out of here!

71
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,790
Damn it...

72
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,320
How am I gonna eat breakfast tomorrow?

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,520
This is one hell of a way to take revenge.

74
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,990
I have to hand it to you, Law...

75
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,360
This is really quite upsetting.

76
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,500
But you will definitely regret it later.

77
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,100
Just remember...

78
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,790
You know nothing of Joker's past.

79
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,090
That will cost you your life.

80
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,130
You may have built a little reputation in this new era,

81
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,180
but you can easily be replaced.
The world is not as kind as you think.

82
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,870
Tell him, Smoker.

83
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,210
This world is much too complex for youngsters.  You push forward on spirit alo-

84
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,770
You needn't worry about me.  Worry about yourself instead.

85
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,670
This room will completely collapse soon.

86
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,490
So long, Pirate Vergo.

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,830
Building R, 1st floor

88
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,920
Only one person could do something like this...

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,220
Law!

90
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,290
What the hell is Vergo doing?!

91
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,440
Master!  What is going on?!

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,780
Men are trapped under the rubble!

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,260
Master!

94
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,620
Dammit!

95
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,200
You've completely messed up my paradise!

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,140
I wonder if everyone's alright.

97
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,940
Building R, second floor!  Can you hear me?

98
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,480
Secret room, respond!

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,080
We're here, Master.  What just happened?

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
Open the air vents, right now!

101
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,680
Let Shinokuni flow into this room!

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,710
B-But if we do that...

103
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,660
I am gas.  I will not die.

104
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,900
U-Understood.

105
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,060
I'll lower the elevator to get our comrades, and then-

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,520
Now!

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,110
I said to do it right now!

108
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,660
So quit dawdling and do it!

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,080
But there are still over a hundred soldiers down there!

110
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,060
Who gives a damn, dumbass!

111
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,850
No matter how many of you useless
guinea pigs die, nobody will miss you.

112
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,690
You're the scum of society!

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,780
Now quit standing around!  Can't you hear me?!

114
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,770
I can recruit all the new subordinates I like!

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,590
Looks like they finally realize what kind of person Caesar really is.

116
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,880
That's Zoro and the others!

117
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,960
Things look bad for them.

118
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,150
Can they control the doors from here?

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,390
What?  Why are you looking at me like that?

120
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,310
Oh, no reason...

121
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,900
Of course.  I get it now!

122
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,800
Master is just acting, to trick the enemy!

123
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,510
O-Oh, I see!  Yeah, that's it!

124
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,250
The killer gas must be part of his plan too.  I mean, would he really harm his own men?

125
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,790
Of course not!

126
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,750
How could we doubt our kind Master?  We must have offended him!

127
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,820
Master, the vents are open.

128
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,360
The killer gas!

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
It's in the building!

130
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,980
That's it.
You should have done what I said from the start.

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,850
Trash shouldn't try to think.

132
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,970
Now, become my power, Shinokuni!

133
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,500
Land of Death

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,670
Land of Death

135
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,770
Land of Death

136
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:55,940
Land of Death

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,040
Land of Death

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,140
Land of Death

139
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,300
Land of Death

140
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,400
Land of Death

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,470
Land of Death

142
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,980
Land of Death

143
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,980
This is the power of my research!

144
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,370
This will kill you.

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:21,160
Two countries have already taken an interest in this public demonstration of my weapon, Shinokuni!

146
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,260
Two utterly peaceful countries!

147
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,020
The moment humans start thinking about how to defend themselves,

148
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,980
they start longing for methods to kill their foes!

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,580
They all need me.

150
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,310
I will fill the world with weapons...

151
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,980
and become the king of Shinokuni!

152
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,370
Behold!

153
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,250
Stop...

154
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,840
He killed our comrades!

155
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,020
What is he doing?!

156
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,340
Master!

157
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,230
It's true.  He only thinks of us as guinea pigs!

158
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,140
This is magnificent, if I do say so myself!

159
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,160
The sheer efficiency of this poison
is a true work of art!

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,390
W-What...

161
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,440
is that?!

162
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,950
The humans have been...

163
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,940
Momo, look after Brownbeard for me.

164
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,920
I-I will.

165
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,790
Hey, where are you going, Straw Hat Luffy?!

166
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,430
Did you suddenly get cold feet?  How pathetic!

167
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,270
But that passage leads to Building B,
which will be flooded by Shinokuni any minute now!

168
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,440
There isn't a safe place left on this island!

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,060
Sorry to interrupt your moment of grief,
but I would like to use that control panel.

170
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,180
I want to protect my companions from the gas!

171
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,440
You... You saw all of that, didn't you?

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,590
You bastard!

173
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,060
Stop it.  You all saw the same thing I saw.

174
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,730
Yeah, that's right.  We've been betrayed!

175
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,600
We're done for.  Even if we tried to fight back...

176
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,930
there's no way out of here!

177
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,680
But the same goes for you!

178
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,160
Didn't you just see
your captain run away from Caesar?!

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
Serves you right!
He's abandoned you to go hide somewhere!

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Did I hear you right?

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,350
Did you just insult my captain to my face?

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,290
If he was just the kind of man who'd betray his crew...

183
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,930
that might honestly be easier for us.

184
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,400
But even if we want to turn tail and run...

185
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,850
he never, ever stops...

186
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,890
believing in our strength.

187
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,560
In the end, we always have to let him have his way!

188
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,500
So we have to keep on living up to his expectations,
no matter what the cost!

189
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,040
More than anything, Luffy hates people like Caesar.

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,200
Luffy will never forgive Caesar.

191
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,640
Caesar!

192
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm sick of seeing your face!

193
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,460
Rubber...

194
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,310
Oh, right!  Straw Hat!

195
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,530
What if I make you my subordina-

196
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,240
Grizzly Magnum!

197
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,860
Various Places in the New World

198
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,860
{\an8}What's going on?

199
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,480
What kind of joke is this?

200
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,330
Public experiment, my ass.

201
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,930
He... defeated Caesar!

202
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,320
We should report this to Mama-bon.

203
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,800
Joker will be forced to make a move now.

204
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,310
Let Jack know about this. {Xemnas: Who the hell is Jack.} {Sewil: Unknown character obviously}

205
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,940
You sure?  He's not gonna like it.

206
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,040
This must be the work of that alliance.

207
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,380
Let the world know.
This isn't just a problem for the underground.

208
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,990
Building B, 2nd Floor

209
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,120
Faster!  Faster!  Faster!

210
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,320
Hang in there, Mocha.

211
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,160
Hey Chopper, can you hear me?

212
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,660
Is that Usopp's voice?{I'm definitely hearing a questioning tone here. So... QUESTION-MARK!!! -Starfish}

213
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,970
Keep going straight and then go down the stairs.

214
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,670
That's the fastest route to Building R.

215
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,700
{\an8}I have to seal off Building R before the gas gets in.

216
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,700
Building R, 2nd Floor · The Secret Room

217
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,570
So you gotta hurry up.

218
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,070
Got it.  Thanks!

219
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,560
Chopper-san!

220
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,310
Huh?  Brook?!

221
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,330
It's terrible!  Kin'emon-san was-

222
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,850
Kin'emon-san was hit by the deadly gas!{He doesn't use the name "Land of Death" here. Actually, does Brook even KNOW that's what it's called? -Starfish}

223
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,070
He's dead!

224
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,300
We had gone to search for Kin'emon-san's son.

225
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,280
We stopped to save the children
in the Inspection Room and found a certain girl.

226
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,780
According to that girl...

227
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,870
What?
Momonosuke transformed into a small dragon?

228
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,940
Yeah.  It's a secret, but it's the truth.

229
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,500
Sir Corpse,
could that dragon that we recently cut down be...

230
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,940
Momonosuke!

231
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,480
I have done something unforgivable!

232
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,410
Kin'emon-san, you mustn't run in that direction!

233
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,880
The deadly gas has already come this far! { def: did we really word it like this?  i'm sure i remember editing this }

234
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,570
There is no path that cannot be walked, even if it's filled with fire or gas!

235
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,250
Momonosuke!

236
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,190
It is impossible, Kin'emon-san!

237
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,680
And that is what happened. { def: wait, you skipped how you got his corpse.  you know, the only part we didn't already know }

238
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,480
How could he be so reckless?

239
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,920
Bulding R, 1st Floor

240
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,650
Luffy!

241
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,550
Oh, Nami!

242
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,970
I'm so happy!  You got here before us.

243
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,960
Brownie's collapsed on the ground.

244
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,680
Is he okay?

245
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,580
Yeah, he's fine.

246
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,330
Oh wait. Maybe he isn't.

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,170
It is the children!{Trying too hard to not use abbreviations? Maybe. Anyway, THAT IS HOW IT IS NOW WRITTEN. -Starfish}

248
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,300
See, Momo?

249
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,090
The kids are fine.

250
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,940
My crewmates have already gone to save them.

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,390
They'll be able to handle the job.

252
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,520
There's no need to worry.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,750
Hurry it up!  We need get to Nami-san and everyone else!

254
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,290
Isn't Chopper's group here yet?

255
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,790
Do you think they'll make it in time, after treating the girl?{I would just like to point out. That Robin's tendency to take ridiculously long pauses in her sentences. Is really obnoxious. -Starfish}

256
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,800
Corridor Between Buildings R and D

257
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,910
Is this necessary?

258
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,340
This is the tram they use to transport the SAD.

259
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Everyone can use it to ride out.

260
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,080
We have to escape as quickly as possible.

261
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,180
Straw Hat.

262
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,000
Traf, Smoke-man! {Xemnas: I think this was how we translated their nicknames.}{I've honestly lost track of which translation of "Kemurin" we're going with by now... But I *THINK* this is right. -Starfish}

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,390
There you are!

264
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,570
Hey, it's Smokey!

265
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,160
Eh? Smokey?

266
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,430
It's really him.

267
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,080
Thank god you're okay.

268
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,930
Smokey!

269
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,340
We have so much to talk about.

270
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,240
Stop fussing!

271
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,880
Straw Hatter, where is Caesar?

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,780
I sent him flying down that way, along with the door.

273
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,220
I wonder how far he flew.

274
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,100
You promised that you'd kidnap him!

275
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,860
But I don't want to catch that guy anymore.

276
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,510
Even if you don't want to, that was the plan.

277
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,960
What are you going to do if he gets away?

278
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,270
Who cares about that guy anyway?

279
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,370
Don't go changing our plans on your whims.

280
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,940
I shouldn't have trusted you with this.

281
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,040
We're going after him!

282
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,820
We turn back time a little.

283
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,480
In the sky near Punk Hazard...

284
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,900
{\an8}When this mission is finished, so is he.

285
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Donquixote Pirates
Servant/Assassin, Baby 5

286
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,360
{\an8}I'll finish him off when I get back.

287
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,360
{\an6}Weapon Fruit,
weaponized-body human

288
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,610
That bastard, Joker!

289
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,580
He killed my precious fiancé, along with an entire town!

290
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,130
I won't let him live!

291
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:10,110
This is the eighth time that he's killed the man
that I've promised to marry, along with eight towns!

292
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,360
Why does he always have to destroy my happiness?

293
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,260
{\an8}That's how the young master shows his love.

294
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:25,160
Donquixote Pirates
Combatant, Buffalo

295
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,770
{\an8}The young master thinks of you like a little sister.

296
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,160
{\an4}Spin Fruit, rotating human

297
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,160
{\an8}That's why he destroys those towns.

298
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,140
You should learn how to refuse proposals.

299
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,920
Why would I do that?  He needed me!

300
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,060
I've fallen in love with you at first sight.
Please marry me.

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,070
You have to do something
about your habit of never turning anyone down.

302
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,070
It's weird that you're subscribed to fifty newspapers.

303
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,740
You lend people too much money, 
and you're talked into buying too many things.

304
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,790
How much money do you owe people, now?

305
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,520
Shut up!  I owe 98 million belly.

306
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,360
It's my life.  Let me do what I want.

307
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,140
Oh, okay.  Lend me two million!

308
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,770
He needs me!

309
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,130
Um... When do you need it?

310
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,090
I want to go to the casino when we get back.

311
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,410
Then I'll get you the money
as soon as we finish this mission.

312
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,600
I'll complete my assigned mission, but I will definitely kill that Joker.

313
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,670
I see it.

314
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,940
It's Punk Hazard!

315
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,180
The island is completely covered with Caesar's gas.

316
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,250
I wonder if I can blow up the gas.

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,150
Leave it to me!  Jump up above me, Baby 5.

318
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,630
Behold!  My power is like a typhoon.

319
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,310
Gust: Matasaburo!

320
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,820
If we wait there,
then Caesar, Monet and Vergo should come to us.

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
But I want to hurry home
so I can play roulette at the casino.

322
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,680
Did the tanker explode?

323
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,670
No, something ran into it.

324
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
There's a person down there.

325
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,850
Caesar Clown?!

326
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,800
Dressrosa

327
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,220
Joker, this is Buffalo calling from Punk Hazard.

328
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,960
We just arrived at Punk Hazard.

329
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,770
And a beaten up Master Caesar
came flying out of the island for some reason.

330
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,270
What's that?

331
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,980
Recover Caesar's body immediately and return to Dressrosa.

332
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,480
Huh, what about Monet and Vergo?

333
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,790
There must be a reason.  Just do what he says.

334
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,520
Understood, Joker.

335
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,920
What a fool.

336
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,440
Hey you brats, heaven is my ally.

337
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,910
As long as I have Caesar, I can easily make more SAD.

338
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,420
Did you see something move on the deck of the tanker?

339
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,120
No, there's no way anyone could survive in that gas.

340
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,160
A robot?!

341
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,500
What kind of bird is that?
