Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,350
So many obstacles are already behind us!

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,780
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

We're connected by unwavering bonds, let's head for a bright future!

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,620
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Now let's keep moving forward!

Always look up!

00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,580
Keep your head held high!

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,040
Always step up!

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,890
Fly over the waves!

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,480
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,720
Now let's head for the future!

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,140
We drift forward, riding the waves,

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,350
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,590
all under this flag...

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,730
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,290
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,910
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,850
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,740
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,440
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,730
So many obstacles are already behind us!

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,890
Now let's keep moving forward!

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,280
Always look up!

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,560
Keep your head held high!

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,980
Always step up!

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,780
Fly over the waves!

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,510
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,010

{\an5}The Mastermind in the Shadows and the
Battle Between Gas and Rubber!

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,630
Little White Hunter, for the time being you'll have to keep your hands off Caesar.

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,630
If they start crushing our hearts we'll be at an enormous disadvantage,

45
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,930
so I can't allow you to do as you please until I have my heart back from Vergo.

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,030
While you're on this island you'll have to follow my orders, understand?

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,330
This was the shortest path and I got here as fast as possible.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,320
Where are you, Vergo!?

49
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,140
You stubborn bastard!

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,870
Gotcha!

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,030
No, you haven't!

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,300
Combustion Type!

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,670
Miok Gas!

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,660
Straw Hat!

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,440
What do you hope to gain by attacking me!?

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,960
I don't know yet! But if I capture you now then something interesting is gonna start!

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,340
So you formed an alliance!? Did Law suggest that? You can't trust that guy at all, you know!

58
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,110
He's gonna betray you for sure! Don't do it!

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,580
Something like that is for me to decide!

60
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,760
You want more pain, you rubber bastard!?

61
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,450
Airless World!

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,710
I can't breathe!

63
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,870
That's right!

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm safe back here!

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,110
That's right, there's a fixed range where you can't breathe!

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,710
But, can you stay at that distance forever?

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,580
Rubber...

68
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,650
Jet Pistol!

69
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,090
That hurt, dammit!

70
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,630
However, if you come any closer you're gonna choke!

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,990
Not again!

72
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,020
Does it hurt? Watch this, here's all the oxygen!

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,470
Blue Sword!

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,540
Again!

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,400
Watch this! You're gonna burn to ash!

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:29,470
I can manipulate all gases! If poison gas won't work there are plenty of other ways to attack you!

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,090
Armanent Hardening!

78
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,720
Whaâ€”

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,900
Rubber...

80
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,200
Jet Gatling!

81
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,660
What's this!? A wall?

82
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,750
Snow Hut.

83
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,110
Quite impressive, an average pirate couldn't break this wall.

84
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,600
Huh? Are you an ability user?

85
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,560
Master, you should go, this is a pointless fight.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
It certainly is.

87
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,730
Are you running away!?

88
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,520
So long, Straw Hat, you can fight as much as you like now!

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,510
I've already thought of the perfect way to include you all in the experiment!

90
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,200
I hope you're looking forward to it!

91
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,300
Wait!

92
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,840
I won't let you chase him.

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,870
If master were to have an accident,

94
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,410
Joker would kill me.

95
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,920
The bird-guy I saw during the war? What does he have to do with all this!?

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,620
Connecting Passage for Buildings A & B

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,130
{\an8}Hurry up! The gate is closing!

98
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,650
{\an8}Run!

99
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,750
Is that the Straw Hat crew's Black Leg!?

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,400
Why the hell is he helping us!?

101
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,250
Stomach...

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,520
Strike!

103
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,720
Whoa, he's strong!

104
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,110
Black Leg from the Straw Hat crew is fighting that fake Vergo!

105
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,380
We've gotta back him up!

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,020
What're you guys doing!? Get outta here!

107
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,830
Once this place is locked down they're gonna flood it with poison gas!

108
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,030
See, I told you!

109
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,040
That deadly gas is coming in! Run!

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,890
Right, it looks like this guy's body is made of iron or something like that.

111
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,620
Stay out of my way. This is between me and them.

112
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,850
You're the type of scum our captain hates the most.

113
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,080
This guy...!

114
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,930
Hey, Black Leg bro!

115
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,980
The gate is closing! Quickly, get over here!

116
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,960
The poison gas is already right behind you! Hurry up!

117
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,840
This is Building D! This is Building D!

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,690
This is an emergency message to all buildings in the third laboratory!

119
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,240
What's this!?

120
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,980
This is Building D! This is an emergency message to all buildings in the third laboratory!

121
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:50,060
One of the Seven Warlords, Trafalgar Law, has just entered the SAD production room!

122
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,230
What the hell!? Is that bastard totally insane!?

123
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,480
If he actually interferes with this then he's going to be sorry!

124
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,170
That's what he was up to!

125
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,290
What the hell!?

126
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,850
Kidnapping the Master? Then the SAD will...

127
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,610
I can see what you're trying to do now.

128
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,060
Law joined up with Straw Hat in order to launch a counterattack!

129
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,240
He became one of the Seven Warlords just to get inside that room!

130
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,020
SAD Production Room

131
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,020
{\an8}That little bastard!

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,160
He must be plotting the worst possible scenario!

133
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,720
Does he really intend...

134
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,610
to completely unbalance the New World!?

135
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,810
Connecting Passage for Buildings A & B

136
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,810
{\an8}I repeat! The traitor, Trafalgar Law has...

137
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,430
Wait! Don't close the gate!

138
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,380
That fake Vergo and Black Leg bro are still in there!

139
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,780
It closed!

140
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,200
There's nothing we can do! The other side of the gate will be totally filled with that lethal gas!

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,310
Black Leg!

142
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
Bro!

143
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,690
Black Leg bro!

144
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,810
Hey! Are you alright!? You are the Navy's...

145
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,410
That's...!

146
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,200
cutest girl ever!

147
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,190
Black Leg!

148
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,990
Hell yeah, Black Leg bro!

149
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm so glad you're alive!

150
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,050
We're so grateful!

151
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,020
Shut up, you pack of bastards! Look, I'll only listen to the lilting cheer of girls!

152
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,660
Hey, Black Leg, we're really glad that you're not hurt!

153
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,650
Shut up! I only accept care and sympathy from girls!

154
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,490
That was dangerous. If that fight had kept going...

155
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,390
Anyway, what's up with that guy? Isn't he your superior officer!?

156
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,600
No way!

157
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
That bastard isn't Vice Admiral Vergo!

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,690
He's an impostor!

159
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,390
Ain't that right, Captain-chan?

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes, of course! The real Vergo wouldn't do that to you guys, he's like a loyal parent to you all!

161
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,710
He'd never do anything like that.

162
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,770
Impostor or not, his expression changed and then he suddenly disappeared.

163
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,200
We've gotta hurry, too!

164
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,930
We have to save the children and get them out of here!

165
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah!

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,450
We're right behind you, Captain-chan!

167
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,170
Building B Interior

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,780
Law's after the SAD!?

169
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,450
Yes. It's clear now that Law has betrayed us.

170
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,090
The New World, Dressrosa

171
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,820
{\an8}That's what I figured!

172
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,640
{\an8}I thought of him as my brother.

173
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,290
One of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea
Donquixote Doflamingo (Black Market Broker: Joker)

174
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,290
{\an8}I watched over him carefully as he grew up.

175
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
Too bad.

176
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,450
I understand.

177
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,370
He's in the SAD production room?

178
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,340
If I were in his shoes, the first thing I'd do is wreck the whole room.

179
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,890
And then kidnap Caesar?

180
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,860
Nah, I'd probably just kill him.

181
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,200
After all, Caesar is the only person in the world

182
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,670
who knows how to properly prepare the SAD.

183
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,830
Still, if he does do this, I'll be in a lot of trouble, Vergo.

184
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,410
If Caesar is killed then there's no one else who can make the gas. That'll be bad for my business.

185
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,120
Try relaxiin', Baby 5, what're you doiin' to our poor master?

186
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm not gonna forgive him this time! I'm gonna kill this filthy bastard!

187
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,070
And if I get into trouble? What happens after that?

188
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,230
Oiin!

189
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,070
After that comes...

190
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,660
a series of unfortunate events!

191
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,490
What do you intend to do about our cute youngster Law-chan, young master?

192
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,050
It's quite clear that he's rebelling against us, don't you agree, young master?

193
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,560
It must be painful for you, Vergo, but please get rid of Law right now.

194
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,500
He must be made to regret that he was ever born into this world. Make his death truly unpleasant.

195
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,080
I understand.

196
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,170
I'll even take a photo of the corpse for you to see, Doffy.

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,520
I can use the camera that I bought in Dressrosa.

198
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,360
You didn't even buy a camera in Dressrosa, did you?

199
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,330
That's right, I didn't buy a camera at all.

200
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,600
In that case I'll bring you one of his ears.

201
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,910
I can't wait!

202
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,920
Caesar, Monet, are you listening?

203
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,710
Yes, Joker.

204
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,620
Oh, Joker!

205
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,530
Law is a given, but you must be wary of Straw Hat, he has awakened the Conqueror's Haki within him.

206
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,020
His abilities may be even greater than Law's.

207
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,190
I have the perfect hotblooded lady hanging around here.

208
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,850
I'll be sending Baby 5 and Buffalo over there now.

209
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,780
When this mess is over you must all come to Dressrosa.

210
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,900
Of course.

211
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,120
Understood.

212
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,660
Building B Interior - Brownbeard Bus and Passengers

213
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,470
Man, this little dragon is even more trouble than that big one. He's really nimble.

214
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,070
Then what're you lying around for!?
 Stop the damn dragon!

215
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,810
Building B is already a sea of flames.

216
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,620
If we let him carry on like that and one of these tanks explodes...

217
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,410
Then the walls might break and that deadly gas will come flooding inside!

218
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,490
If that happens then there's no way that anyone will survive!

219
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,870
Wait, everyone!

220
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,000
I cannot allow myself to back down from this dragon!

221
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,320
I bear a grudge against him!

222
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,590
With my own two hands I swearâ€”

223
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,020
No, no, I'm the one who can't forgive what that dragon has done!

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,760
You all saw it, didn't you? His terrible behavior earlier!

225
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,470
He charged right in, wanting to eat me...

226
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,750
Right before my very eyes he gave me such a disappointed look!

227
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,960
You're not exactly food though, are you?

228
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,300
Even bones have nutrition, you know!{Hattori: Does Robin break the fourth wall for a few frames there!? :D }{Sewil: Not everybody hates Brook you know.}

229
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,860
Alright, sure, I'll bear that in mind.

230
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,570
Kin'emon-san, please let me deal with this!

231
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,570
What are you saying!? You must step back now!

232
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,830
No, I'll do it!

233
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,700
It will be me!

234
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,640
I will!

235
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
It will be me!

236
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,470
I will!

237
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,290
With a one, and a two and a nin, nin, nin!

238
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,940
What ever are you doing?

239
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,080
Being a samurai!

240
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,550
That's a ninja!

241
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,620
Here he comes!

242
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,960
Thunder Trap!

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,100
My opponent!

244
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Breast band girl, you can use ninja skills!?

245
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,770
Stop calling me that!

246
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,080
Eat this! The foulest smelling flower in the world!

247
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,140
Deadly Green Star! Rafflesia!

248
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,160
Whoa! So, even the puppy-faced goblin can use witchcraft!

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,420
Who're you callin' a goblin!?

250
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,030
Forty Flowers! Four Hands!

251
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,130
Hold!

252
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,770
Even the courtesan uses witchcraft!

253
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,070
He's falling! I'll finish him off!

254
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,220
Never! Leave him to me!

255
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,150
Follow after me, Corpse-dono!

256
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,680
Foxfire Style! Conflagration Cutter!

257
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,930
He cut fire again!

258
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,890
Nice work!

259
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,330
Nothing of the sort.

260
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,130
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

261
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,130
{\an8}Gavotte Forward Leap

262
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,300
Flaming Fox Flourish!

263
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,920
Who're you calling a corpse?

264
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,220
Ah, I guess I am a corpse.

265
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,090
Alright!

266
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,510
We did it.

267
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,310
Perfect victory!

268
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,790
Please say "bones are tasty"!

269
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,160
Damn this irritating dragon!

270
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,380
Bastard, bastard!

271
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,450
I had good reason, but Kin'emon-san, why're you beating him like he's your parent's worst enemy?

272
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,530
He's as good as my parent's worst enemy!

273
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,000
Hey, wait, wait...

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,180
Both of you get back on quickly or we'll leave you behind!

275
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,280
Ah, wait for us, please!

276
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,590
Wait a minute! Look at that!

277
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,050
That voice!

278
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,700
Chopper's transformed into a monster!

279
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,050
What the heck is he doing!?

280
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,330
Building B 2nd Floor - Examination Room

281
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,110
Alright, there doesn't seem to be any problem.

282
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,440
You can go back to the Biscuit Room now.

283
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,330
Really?

284
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,470
There's candy there for you.

285
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,750
Yay!

286
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,250
Hey, I was thinkin', where'd that other kid go?

287
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,360
Other kid?

288
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,470
Yeah.

289
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,440
He went to the secret room you shouldn't go to.

290
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,990
Then he turned into a little dragon.

291
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,390
That boy Momonosuke did.
