1
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,030
Nami's been kidnapped?

2
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,530
It's my fault.

3
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,430
They were huge, but I still didn't notice them until they were right in front of us.

4
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,240
First it's centaurs, now it's beastmen?!

5
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,630
This island's crawling with weirdos.

6
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,710
Maybe they're testing us for weaknesses.

7
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,430
So, they didn't come to rescue Brown-gator?

8
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,120
Their true objective seemed to be the children,
and our lives!

9
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,280
But it sounded like Master hired them to silence Brownbeard first.

10
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,570
Even though they're supposed to be friends.

11
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,860
Even though Brownbeard admired Master so much.

12
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,130
Master is the kind-hearted god of salvation.{cp from 591, which is slight rewording of 589}

13
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,920
Luffy, Master really is a twisted individual.

14
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,290
I would never let the children go back
to such a cruel person!

15
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,370
I'm also worried about Nami-Franky, who got kidnapped.

16
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,870
Who knows what they could be doing to her?!

17
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,820
Yeah, we're definitely getting her back.

18
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,310
Okay, I'll leave the kids to you!

19
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,950
Hold it, Luffy!

20
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,160
It was my body that they took.

21
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,940
Chopper, I can't fight in this body.

22
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,570
Gimme some of those beans that you use to transform.

23
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,190
The beans that make you a monster.

24
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,800
Beans?  The Rumble Ball is a dangerous drug!

25
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,180
It'd probably be impossible for you to control it!

26
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,080
I'll super-overcome that with fighting spirit!

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Just hurry up and gimme 'em!

28
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,110
Okay, but just one.

29
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,490
Got it?  You can only be a monster for three minutes.

30
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,260
After that, you won't be able to fight.

31
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,290
If possible, just use Kung-fu Point which I showed you earlier.

32
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,930
Vvvvvvvvuper!

33
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,930
Too soon!

34
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,040
Let's go, Franky.  This way!

35
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,520
Why are you attacking me?!

36
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,230
It's no good!  I knew he'd go berserk!

37
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,090
So... what was Franky planning to do?

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,190
After the rampage he won't be able to move,
so I don't think he'll be much help... at all.

39
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,610
He's just going to be in the way.

40
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,890
Caesar's Laboratory

41
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I don't know where he got it,

42
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,720
but it seems that the metal man Franky
installed one of Vegapunk's lasers into his body.

43
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,950
After we dissect him and take the laser system, there'll be no other use for him.

44
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,010
Might as well throw him in the incinerator.

45
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,920
Understood.

46
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,250
And can you tell me what happened
to those stupid Marines who came to take a ship?

47
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,080
Y-Yes, sir.

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
The battle has become quite chaotic...

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,720
So... you're saying that you can't handle it?

50
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,690
Well, you see...

51
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,230
Oh, I know just the thing!

52
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,510
Master?

53
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,920
We are fighting the Navy.

54
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,200
This is a perfect situation to put him to the test.

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,500
Oh, that's good.  Let's do that.

56
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,190
Immediately contact the centaurs that are out on patrol.

57
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,940
Yes, sir!

58
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,270
And tell the rest of the soldiers to use this time to evacuate.

59
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,560
If they want to live, that is.

60
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,390
Laboratory - Far Side of the Mountain

61
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,020
Lemme go!  Lemme go, you idiot!

62
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,700
What are you perverts doing?!

63
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,580
Why are you kidnapping me?

64
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,960
Although I am cute, and proportioned,
so I understand why you would want to kidnap me.

65
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,590
What is this man saying?

66
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,680
He must be queer.  Pretty cool.

67
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,910
But it doesn't matter what you do!

68
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,850
Luffy won't let you get away!

69
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,490
You're gonna get beaten to a pulp!

70
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,040
Shut up now.  People who talk too much...

71
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,670
are not cool.

72
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,840
But apparently,
the weapon that's built into your body...

73
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,260
is cool.

74
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,670
And when we hand you over to Master,
the reward will be...

75
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,800
so cool!

76
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,250
Rock

77
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,270
But it's really cold today.

78
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,520
Scotch

79
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Yeah, our bodies are too cool.

80
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
- Hit Men of Snowy Mountain -

81
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Yeti Cool Brothers

82
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,430
Put some clothes on!

83
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,160
With the difference in size between us,
these rifles are like cannons to you.

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,140
We have poison-gas bullets, too.

85
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,890
And if we don't show ourselves
then there's no way to defeat us.

86
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,910
You got friends coming?  Of course you do.

87
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,440
We arranged for them to come here!

88
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,250
It's only natural that they'll follow our footsteps.

89
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,330
Footsteps!  Footsteps!  Man, this is great!

90
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,220
It's so easy to see where they're going.

91
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,600
Hey!  Franky!  I said to cut it out!

92
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,410
Huh?

93
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,470
The footsteps disappeared.

94
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,890
Huh?

95
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,400
Luffy?  And Chopper... No, that's Franky!

96
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,670
Nami!

97
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,110
Watch out!  There are enemies here!

98
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,350
Let's go, Scotch.

99
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,440
Okay.

100
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,130
He must be pretty thick
if he didn't even notice the cliff.

101
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,920
There's spikes below!

102
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,400
This is almost too easy.

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,330
The ice spikes will pierce him!

104
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,700
{\an8}Color of Arms - Hardening

105
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,270
I see.

106
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,490
I guess the normal tricks won't be enough.

107
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,920
Dead end!

108
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,590
Using this technique to deflect attacks
in random directions isn't much good in a fight.

109
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,210
Rayleigh taught me that.

110
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,440
Instead, turn it into a counterattack by sending
every bullet back at your enemy with double power!

111
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,850
{\an8}Gun Salute

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,310
Rock!

113
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,960
I said cut it out, Franky!

114
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,390
Why is he the one giving you the most trouble here?!

115
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,340
Now I'm hot and bothered.
They're fighting amongst themselves?

116
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,720
They're underestimating us!

117
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,070
Quit it!

118
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,970
I'll show you! The frozen mountain has all kinds of weapons!

119
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,590
Look out!  The frozen summit's falling!

120
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,730
Luffy!  Franky!  Look up!  Up!

121
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,330
You won't be able to dodge
that block of ice after I'm done!

122
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,580
They're attacking from the sides!  Enemies!

123
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,710
This KYP gas-bullet will knock you out instantly!

124
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,840
Die, just like your other friends!

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,280
He did something useful!

126
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,840
Great job, Franky!

127
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,470
Hey, gimme a break!

128
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,590
That's the strongest attack you've used today!

129
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,220
Luffy!

130
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,500
Dammit!  Sorry, Franky-Chopper.

131
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,070
I'll have Chopper look at your injuries later.

132
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,100
Stop right there!

133
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,720
I thought we told you.
The mountain is our playground.

134
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
It's impossible to catch me.

135
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,860
Save me!

136
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,070
He doesn't give up.  But he can't match my reach.

137
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,930
He's like a monkey.

138
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,940
Alright!

139
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,220
Dammit.  The mountain's huge,
so if he gets away then it'll be impossible to find him.

140
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,150
Him?

141
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,380
Well, if it isn't Trafalgar Law, the freeloader.

142
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,360
It's a good thing I ran into you.  Right now, Straw Hat Luffy is...

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,570
What the hell do you think you're doing?

144
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,710
Thank you!

145
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,110
Wait... Hey, you!  Gimme my body back!

146
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,540
Nami!

147
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,460
Luffy!

148
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,910
Oh, it's Traf!  So you saved Nami?

149
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,380
I've been thinking.

150
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,550
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you, Straw-Hatter.

151
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,800
It may have been just a coincidence that you came to this island,

152
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,730
but there's actually a key hidden here.  One with
the power to throw the entire New World into chaos.

153
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,590
There are two ways to survive in the New World.

154
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,250
Either be protected by one of the Four Emperors,

155
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,140
or fight all of them.

156
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,170
You're not the kind of guy
who'll serve under someone else, are you?

157
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,780
That's right.  I prefer being the captain!

158
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,800
In that case, form an alliance with me.

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,150
An alliance?

160
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,280
If you and I work together, we might be able to do it.

161
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,390
I've got a plan to dethrone one of the Four Emperors.

162
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,060
An alliance?

163
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,610
Are you suggesting that if we work together
we could defeat one of the Four Emperors?

164
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,610
That's ridiculous!  I don't know what you're after, but...

165
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,890
Luffy, don't fall for his fast talk.

166
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,390
I didn't say we'd be able to do it now.

167
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,350
But if we play our cards right
we should eventually be able to create an opportunity.

168
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,910
What do you say, Straw-Hatter?

169
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,160
Which one of the Four Emperors are you talking about?

170
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,130
Hold on, Luffy!  Why are you listening to him?

171
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,800
You can't trust someone like him!

172
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,970
I see.

173
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,320
Okay!  We're in!

174
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,230
What?!

175
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,430
Straw Hat Pirates' Temporary Shelter{lit. evacuation point--not temporary}

176
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,430
Whaaaat?!

177
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,290
We're forming an alliance with the Heart Pirates?!

178
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,820
You just went to get Nami back,
so how did it come to such a crazy deal?!

179
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,970
Like I said-

180
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,470
I won't be able to sleep at night if we form an alliance with such an enigmatic, unpredictable bastard!

181
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,960
Come on Luffy, everybody's against it.

182
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,100
We don't have to do it.
There's no reason to do something this dangerous.

183
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,160
We should continue our voyage at our own pace.

184
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,690
That's right, Luffy!
It's far too soon to try to take on the Four Emperors!

185
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,290
There's no way we could fight them.

186
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,250
So what about this raccoon dog?

187
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,630
I'm not a raccoon dog anymore!

188
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,820
Whaa?!

189
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,790
It's me!

190
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,030
S-Super...

191
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,260
What happened to me?!

192
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,600
Luffy...

193
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,160
I'll follow your decision, but...

194
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,370
pirate alliances and betrayal go hand in hand.

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,000
They might not be suited
for someone as overly trusting as you.

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,570
Hey, you gonna betray me?

197
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,100
Nope.

198
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
Hey!  Try to be a little skeptical!

199
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,610
Anyway,
I think a pirate alliance sounds like a lot of fun!

200
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,090
I think Traf's a good guy...

201
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,590
but even if he isn't, there's no need to worry!

202
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,550
You guys have trained a lot in the past two years
and can back me up.

203
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,660
Whaaa?!

204
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,800
Luffy, you...

205
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,370
Oh, cut it out!  It's embarrassing.

206
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,880
Hey, you can super-rely on us.

207
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,150
We do manage to help out every now and then...

208
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,240
but it's not like we're happy, you jerk!

209
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,870
A-Alright then, Luffy!  You can rely on us!

210
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,110
If Zoro and the others chicken out,
I will convince them!

211
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm back!  Back in my perfect body!

212
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,890
Yep, being me is best for me!

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,670
Super!

214
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,720
That's great, Franky.

215
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
I hope you never wind up back in Chopper's body,

216
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
ever again.

217
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,790
I'm also...

218
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,190
back to normal.

219
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,300
But how could you leave my body all broken?!

220
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,480
What the hell were you thinking,
treating other people's bodies like this?!

221
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,830
Oh, sorry.

222
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,760
It's all his fault.

223
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,790
What?!
You were the one rampaging in Chopper's body!

224
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,530
My only choice was to stop you!

225
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,940
But still, you didn't have to use an attack powerful enough to take out the kraken!

226
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,230
You're both just as bad!

227
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,330
Oh, sorry.

228
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,150
Isn't it enough just to be in your own body, Chopper?

229
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,380
Why am I the only one who has to bear this pain?!

230
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,960
First Franky's body and now Sanji-kun.

231
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,660
Don't laugh at others' expense!  I can't believe you!

232
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,110
There's nothing we can do.

233
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,760
We have Chopper and Franky's bodies,
so their souls can return to the right places...

234
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,970
but Sanji took your body to search for the samurai.

235
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,810
Your soul was left over,
so it had to go into Sanji's body.

236
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,090
Can't you do anything?  Come on!

237
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,460
It's impossible without a body.

238
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,830
So these are the children?

239
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,630
Yeah, I wanna save these kids.

240
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,700
They're more trouble than they're worth.  Leave 'em.

241
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,590
Apparently they're all addicted to drugs.

242
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,730
We know that!  I examined them!

243
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,030
That's why I want to take them back to their homes, but it'll take time to get the drug out of their system.

244
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,570
And they've been turned into giants too.

245
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,370
What a terrible experiment they performed on them

246
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,730
They've been researching
how to turn humans into giants for centuries.

247
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,830
The project was run by the World Government.

248
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,250
The Government?  Why would they do such a thing?

249
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,630
Most likely to make soldiers.

250
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,510
Nobody could stand against the Government
if they turned all of their soldiers into giants.

251
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:58,150
If Caesar successfully perfects the process
then he would trump the Government and Vegapunk...

252
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,420
but of course it isn't an easy thing to do.

253
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,480
You really want to save them?

254
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
They're just some random kids from here and there.

255
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,830
Yes.  Maybe we've never met
or even seen these kids before...

256
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,420
but the kids cried and begged that we save them.

257
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,330
Master may have done a good job
of tricking them to bring them here,

258
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,140
but some of the older children are already realizing that this facility isn't exactly what it seems.

259
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,980
Until I make sure that these kids are safe,
I will never leave this island!

260
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,740
So, are you planning to stay here by yourself?

261
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,570
We don't leave anybody behind.

262
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,660
Nami and Chopper want to do it,
so I'll help them.

263
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,030
Oh, and Sanji went to put the samurai back together.

264
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,280
If you're going to be allied with us
then you gotta help us out.

265
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,820
Jeez, I knew you had no idea what was going on.

266
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,930
The "alliance" he asked you to form...

267
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,450
only means that we're working together for the
sole purpose of achieving a certain objective, right?

268
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,510
Naturally.

269
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,730
That's what you meant, but when Luffy
hears the word "alliance" he thinks of something else.

270
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,310
Like friends, right?

271
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,520
If you thought you could get him to follow some plan,
that isn't gonna happen.

272
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
Yep, that's right.

273
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,580
Once he gets some wild idea, he won't budge.
That's the problem with Luffy.  It's always like this.

274
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,030
In terms of self-centered stubbornness, Luffy's on par with the Four Emperors.

275
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,450
Wow, that sounds terrible.

276
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,950
But what your crew member is currently trying to do
has absolutely nothing to do with our-

277
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,780
Hey!  Don't flick boogers on me, you asshole!

278
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,070
Oh, my bad!

279
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,810
I can't even dodge when I'm like this!

280
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,840
My bad.

281
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,430
Oh, all right.  We don't have time to argue.

282
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,060
You guys can take care of the samurai yourselves.

283
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,940
I'll investigate the drug
that was administered to the children.

284
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,340
Which one of you is the doctor?

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,180
Come with me.  We'll have to distract Caesar.

286
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,230
Okay, this should do it.

287
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,700
Sorry.  I can't move right now so I'll have to rely on you.

288
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,410
Don't drop him, Traf!

289
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,020
Sorry... can't stop... laughing!

290
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,870
Super-cute!

291
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,570
We're counting on you, Chopper.

292
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,510
Leave it to me.

293
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,010
It should be clear
from the actions of the two assassins...

294
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,880
Caesaro plans to kill both you and White Hunter's G-5,
and then take the kids back.

295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,960
He'll keep coming until he gets what he wants.

296
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,610
Four years ago, as a former Government scientist, he was judged a criminal after the accident.

297
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,790
If word gets out that there are people on this island, which is supposed to be off-limits to everyone,

298
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,310
then he'll lose this perfect hideout.

299
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,930
That's why he'll do everything he can to kill you.

300
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,210
He has a bounty of 300 million beli.

301
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,690
He possesses weapons of mass destruction as well as
the powers of the Gas Gas Fruit, a logia-type.

302
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,210
That's the Caesar Clown we're dealing with.

303
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,100
300 million...

304
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,050
People who can't wield haki
should definitely stay away from him.

305
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,810
He isn't your average scientist.

306
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,880
Our haki-users are me, Zoro, and Sanji.

307
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,050
And you, I presume?

308
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,710
That should be enough.

309
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,510
I'll head to the laboratory first.

310
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,330
Then when we get there,
we'll all kidnap Master together.

311
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,940
That's right.

312
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,340
But... what do you mean by kidnap?

313
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,650
For ransom?  But wouldn't Master have the money?

314
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,210
If you kidnap him, who's going to pay us?

315
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,470
The objective isn't money.  It's confusion.

316
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,230
Confusion?

317
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,640
What do you mean?

318
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,680
There's no point in talking about it, until we succeed.

319
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,010
Anyways, focus on capturing Caesar Clown.

320
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,950
It won't be easy.

321
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,140
When the time comes,
I'll lay out the entire plan to everyone.

322
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,560
But once we succeed in capturing Caesar,

323
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,050
the situation's naturally going to be chaotic.

324
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,130
When that happens, there's no turning back.

325
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,530
I guess this is our last chance to change our minds.

326
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,690
It's fine.  I'll work with you.

327
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,990
In that case, I also accept your wishes.

328
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,570
Make sure to convince the rest of your crew as well.

329
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,570
Yeah, got it.

330
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,110
Caesar Clown's Laboratory - Main Entrance

331
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,170
Take this!  You damn monster!

332
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,440
Iron-joint Smoodge!

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,260
Fein Bock the Gourd!

334
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,620
Chappe the Rope-puller!

335
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,120
Smoker-san!

336
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,060
There's no doubt, these are all former prisoners.

337
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,950
Though their bodies have been changed.

338
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,190
What is this?!

339
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,960
The accident report from four years ago said that none of the prisoners survived.  Was that a lie?

340
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,640
Smo-san, who are these guys?!

341
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,310
Hell if I know!

342
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,740
Just focus on drawing the enemy inland for now!

343
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,720
We will get on board that ship,
and set sail to make our report!

344
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,460
Master, the Snail Phone's ringing.

345
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,060
No need to answer it.

346
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,840
They're going to say, "We opened the door."

347
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,370
And then, "Something came out of it."

348
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,420
"Some of our men died.  Save us."

349
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,230
And then screams.

350
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,710
It's hard on the ears.

351
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,520
We have more than enough people like that.

352
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,370
We can always capture more test subjects.

353
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,640
Can you hear me?!  Master!  Can you hear me?!

354
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,250
Please come in!

355
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,550
This is the Burning Lands!
We opened the door, just like you said!

356
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,180
It's no use!  Master isn't answering!

357
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,860
It's coming!

358
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,440
What the hell is that thing
that came out of the warehouse?

359
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,430
We've already lost too many men.  Just run!

360
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,070
It's as big as a mountain!  What the hell is that blob?!

361
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,800
It's right behind us!  Save us!

362
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,110
Master!

363
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,110
Let me introduce my pet.

364
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,970
It's an extremely rare life-form, a slime.

365
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,680
Ma...ster...

366
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,220
No one will make it off this island alive!

367
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
How's it feel to be free after so long?

368
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,490
Smiley!
