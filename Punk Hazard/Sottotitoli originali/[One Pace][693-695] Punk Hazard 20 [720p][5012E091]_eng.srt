Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

So many obstacles are already behind us!

Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

We're connected by unwavering bonds, let's head for a bright future!

00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,490
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,560
Now let's head for the future!

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,990
We drift forward, riding the waves,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,220
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,460
all under this flag...

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,600
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

30
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,110
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,750
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,680
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

33
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,610
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,300
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,590

Always step up!

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,650

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,370

Are you alright, Buffalo?!

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Who is that guy -dasuyan?!

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,140
Don't ask me!

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,510
Anyway, why did he shoot at us for no reason?

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,570
What is that thing?  A Pacifista?

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,620
That can't be it.
Caesar has no interest in human weapons.

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,740
Buffalo!

52
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,900
Dasuyaniiiiin!

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,520
Fine.  I don't know who you are...

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,910
but if you want a fight, I'll give you one!

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,230
General Okay!

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,430
I didn't even scratch the paint!?

57
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,400
Now, take this!

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,630
General...

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Shield!

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,630
Way too late, and way too small!

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,950
General Shield...

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,160
Boomerang!

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,370
He threw the shield!

64
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,420
Is he really that desperate?!

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,360
It seems...

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,260
that you can't be handled with my little toys.

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,880
Very well.  You're an enemy if you
 want to stop us from freeing Caesar.

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,250
Weapon Metamorphose...

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Espada Girl!

70
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:22,290
Dasuyan!

71
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,660
Easy!

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,140
General Left!

73
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,910
The young master's orders
must be carried out immediately -dasuyan!

74
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,330
Missile Girl!

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,080
Here goes -dasuyan!

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,190
Counting on you!

77
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,230
Dasuyan...

78
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,830
Spinning Projectile Cannon!

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,230
We'll be taking Caesar!

80
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,120
What're you on about?  What about Caesar?

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,040
Where am I?

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't move... Damn it, is this the end?

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,500
The heart of Smoker, Vice Admiral of Navy Unit G-5.

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,970
What a thoughtful present, Law.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,870
Smoker!  If nothing else, I'll at least...

86
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,980
take you down with me!

87
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,550
Inside Laboratory 3 - Building R

88
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,790
Hey, what are you doing, Straw Hatter crew?!

89
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,900
Get on, all of you!

90
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,400
If we let Caesar escape, the entire plan will be ruined!

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,470
What're you talking about?

92
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,000
Some of my crew-members haven't arrived yet!

93
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,760
Corridor Between Building B and R

94
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,760
{\an8}Hurry up, Chopper!  Brook!

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,570
Alright, Usopp!

96
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,710
We're the ones doing all the running, you know!

97
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,910
You have to outrun the gas!

98
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,800
{\an8}Hurry!  Just 50 more meters!

99
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,100
Building R, 2nd Floor - The Secret Room

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,450
{\an8}The gate's about to close!  You have to slip through!

101
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,490
This building is done for!

102
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,790
I can't stay here either!

103
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,690
The gate's closing!

104
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,990
Luffy!

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,100
There they are!

106
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,430
We made it!

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,820
Alright! Everyone's here!

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,900
Don't make us worry so much.

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,430
I'm so glad you made it in time.

110
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,310
Yeah, and it's all thanks to you, Usopp!

111
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,150
We're the ones who ran our asses off, you know!

112
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,390
Anyway, this place is gonna blow!  Everyone get on!

113
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,650
Hurry!

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,000
We're getting out of here, guys!

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,670
Yeah!

116
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,470
Whatever shall we do?!

117
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,430
What shall we do about Kin'emon-san?!

118
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,880
What?!  Kin'emon?!

119
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,110
What can we do, with him like that?

120
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,400
K-Kin'emon!

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,840
Joker...

122
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,180
Can you hear me?

123
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,010
This is...

124
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,880
Monet.

125
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,620
Monet, I'm glad you're alive.

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Vergo was defeated.  As was Caesar.

127
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,370
But Baby 5 and Buffalo
should be able to recover Caesar.

128
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,330
This is all a mistake on my part.

129
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,630
I apologize for putting you in this position.

130
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,700
But I'd like to make the most of this situation.
I want you to kill all those youngsters now.

131
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:47,710
The Third Laboratory holds a weapon that's identical
to the one that destroyed the island four years ago.

132
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,300
If you just press the self destruct button...

133
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,990
then only one person will be left alive.

134
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,940
The only person who can survive the lethal gas...

135
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,160
will be Caesar.

136
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,160
The button is located at-

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,180
Say no more, Joker.

138
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,300
That was my plan all along.

139
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,090
I'm right in front of the self destruct button.

140
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,930
The explosion will even reach the tanker they're planning to escape with.

141
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,440
One of our ships will go to waste.  Is that alright?

142
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,950
Forgive me.

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,650
Please, take it all down with you, and die for me.

144
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,150
Understood...

145
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,290
young master...

146
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
Die, Smoker!

147
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm sorry, partner.

148
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,140
I've known you longer than any of the others.

149
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,020
You've done well, until today.

150
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,560
Did you enjoy that? My Missile Girl's...

151
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,900
flaming passion.

152
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,850
Hey, Baby 5!

153
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,750
Why do you need this weapon when you're a weapon woman? {Xemnas has a "your/you're" disease}{I noticed this as well. -E9}

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,180
Thanks for picking it up for me, Buffalo.

155
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,150
That weapon is blessed.

156
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,130
Whoever owns this weapon will become happy.

157
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,540
And if you buy it, I'll be happy too.

158
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,090
I am...

159
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,940
needed!

160
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,190
No, you were being used!

161
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,810
Look out behind you -dasuyan!

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,750
I don't know who sent you, but...

163
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:17,060
I am the invincible Iron Pirate,
and I don't protect the peace of the seas!

164
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
Iron Pirate!

165
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,660
He's persistent!

166
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,320
Weapon Metamorphose!

167
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,740
Revolver Girl!

168
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,110
As if that'd work!

169
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,850
This is so fast! {Starfish: Funny how THAT's the first line of this episode, which is anything but.}

170
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,890
Why is a dragon riding with us?

171
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,490
Fath- {Xemnas: He kinda doesn't say the whole word}

172
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,510
What is with you?

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,270
Father!

174
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,230
The eel is attacking me!

175
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
Hey, Momo!

176
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,720
Farewell, young master. {copy paste from 619}

177
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,090
You are the man...

178
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,060
who will become the Pirate King.{end copy paste from 619}

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Are you okay?

180
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,410
Yes.

181
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,510
There must have been an explosion somewhere, right?

182
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,780
It was most likely Building D.

183
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,570
More specifically, it came from the SAD manufacturing room that I was in.

184
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,650
Monet?

185
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,380
What's wrong, Monet?

186
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,160
Hey, Law.

187
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,140
My heart was supposed to be in Caesar's hands.

188
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,480
Why did you have it?

189
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,400
He'd gotten the wrong idea, that's all.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,390
I want your heart! {copy and paste from 601}

191
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,870
And this seals our deal.

192
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,200
After that, I took your heart, when you came to the laboratory.

193
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,140
The heart of Smoker.  Vice Admiral of Navy Unit G-5. {copy paste from 591}

194
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,280
What a thoughtful present, Law. {End copy paste}

195
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,360
I just kindly returned the heart of his attendant Monet to him.

196
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,630
Answer me.

197
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,530
As they all say, when you do something good,

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,240
something good will happen to you.

199
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,530
This is not good!

200
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,280
The place is starting to collapse even faster!

201
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,900
Watch out!

202
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,020
The corridor is collapsing!

203
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,090
This tunnel is built in a mountainside.

204
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,790
If it collapses, we'll be buried alive. {Tenses, guys. -E9}

205
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,760
Why are you talking about it so calmly!

206
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,690
This is bad!

207
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,860
The rubble's blocking the path!{Starfish: Okay seriously, I'm starting to feel like Xemnas has a period-addiction. A comment about their only way out of a collapsing building rapidly filling with poison gas MORE than justifies an exclamation-point, I dare say.}

208
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,920
Where are the brakes? {I seriously felt some Water 7 Nastalgia at this part. -E9}

209
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,150
Awesome!  We're safe now!

210
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,400
I sure wouldn't want him as an enemy!

211
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,380
Even though he is our enemy. {I'm not sure if you guys use italics, but I used it here. Also, I'm not sure if the statement of this marine meant something else, but I changed it to make more sense. Is he was saying he'd want him as a friend and not an enemy, or is he simply saying that he wouldn't want him as an enemy? Feel free to change it back if it's contradictory in any way, but you might want to make the statement a bit more clear. -E9}

212
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,360
There should be gas surrounding the exit as well.

213
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,670
Can anyone here control the wind?

214
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,550
As if you'd find someone with that special ability so easily!

215
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,550
I can control it.

216
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,980
You can!?

217
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,670
I can see the exit!

218
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,840
Alright, just a bit further.

219
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,030
Let's go!

220
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,020
Young master! {BAAAAKAAAA!!!}

221
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,220
The young master isn't here.

222
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,560
He's probably in his room on the 4th floor.

223
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,800
No, he wasn't in there.

224
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,930
And the window was open.

225
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh. Is that so?

226
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,700
Then I have no idea.

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,060
He left without taking any
 subordinates with him again.

228
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,990
{\an8}A-An iron security guard is in our way!

229
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,040
The Sea

230
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,650
So, the island and everyone on it haven't disappeared?

231
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,430
Make sure you kill him.

232
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,040
I'm on my way!

233
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,340
Punk Hazard Shoreline

234
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,300
What is that iron soldier?

235
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,010
None of our attacks do any damage.

236
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,050
It's because you tried to steal my cola.

237
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,120
Cola?

238
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,820
What's he talking about?

239
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,160
Bring it on, Hurricane-man and Weapon-girl!

240
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,210
He's wasting our time!

241
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,080
Let's go, Baby 5.

242
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,790
No one has ever been able to block this attack.

243
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,110
No matter what you try, it's super useless!

244
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,940
We're gonna bore a hole in that body of yours!

245
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,750
This weapon that spins around is...

246
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,920
Huh?

247
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,730
Sickle Girl!

248
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,080
Okay, I'll give you credit for that one.

249
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,440
It's impressive that you have the force to pierce through my General Body!

250
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,470
But you're basically like a mantis trying to fight a warship.

251
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,340
Even though it's wasted on you guys,

252
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:49,400
I'll show you the ultimate secret weapon 
of the pirate ship that will one day control these seas.

253
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,860
The land-based, mobile version of the Gaon Cannon!

254
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,950
Its name is...

255
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,710
General Cannon!

256
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,950
What is this -dasuyan!?

257
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,390
Why is this guy stopping us from getting Caesar back?!

258
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,070
Isn't that Caesar lying down there?

259
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,850
What's he doing here?

260
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,820
I don't know who you're working for,{Read the comment below}

261
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,570
but we can't afford to lose!

262
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,890
Hey hey, now this is a surprise.

263
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,180
These guys aren't your average pirates.

264
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,070
Don't lump us in with that garbage!

265
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,370
In the name of Joker...

266
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,190
we'll be taking Caesar, by any means necessary. {Ellipses don't require a capital after them, regardless of the sentence being split between two people (even though that's not a normal circumstance). I will eventually hammer proper grammar into you all! Also, two clauses require a comma between them. E9}

267
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,060
Now I see!  So your goal...

268
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,800
is Caesar, huh?! {Starfish: I took the liberty of splitting this into two lines to emphasize the pause and to further underline how to Franky this blindingly obvious fact is apparently a shocking reveal.}

269
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,510
We're almost at the exit!

270
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,040
Keep on blowing that wind, Nami!

271
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,460
The outside is flooded with poison gas too!

272
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,880
We made it out!

273
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,940
You guys finally made it.

274
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,840
I was tired of waiting.

275
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,680
Look at that!

276
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,110
It's Shogun!

277
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,930
Super!

278
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,520
It's a robot!

279
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,240
How amazingly cool!

280
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,310
Buffalo?  And you're Baby 5!

281
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,520
Law?!

282
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,900
Are you really going against Joker?

283
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
You traitor!

284
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,420
Joker was saving the Seat of Hearts for you!{Starfish: It'll make sense later.}

285
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,300
Who're they?

286
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,010
Are they your friends?

287
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,020
No.

288
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,140
They're enemies!

289
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,860
The entire Straw Hat Crew and the Navy's G-5 unit!

290
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,240
We can't defeat them all.

291
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,180
What is going on, Baby 5?

292
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,500
In any case, we need to take Caesar to the young master.

293
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,020
They just took Caesar and ran away.

294
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,770
Alright, leave it to me! {Missing TL...}

295
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,990
Flying enemies are the sniper's job.

296
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,730
Those guys!

297
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,560
Hey, hey.

298
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,320
Usopp said to leave it to him.

299
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,240
Don't underestimate our sniper just because his nose is long. {Zoro's right. It's like Ussop has a built in ironsight--seems advantagous to me. E9}

300
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
Don't be an idiot.

301
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,430
If they somehow got away, the plan would...

302
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,930
You made an alliance with us, right?

303
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,790
Weren't you watching just now?
I wish you'd put a bit more faith in us.

304
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,810
What alliance?

305
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,650
All I've been doing is running.

306
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
I want to start attacking.

307
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,270
I'm not afraid of an enemy that's far away and has lost the will to fight.

308
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,910
Furthermore, if the enemy's injured and has their back turned, I can handle him!

309
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,730
Just hurry up and get it done.

310
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,340
Okay, I'm gonna give you some water.

311
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,180
Let's do this.

312
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,440
Grow Up!

313
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,850
Black Kabuto Chomping Grass!

314
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,270
Now, eat and store some ammo.

315
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,370
Be careful, Buffalo.

316
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,390
They're going to attack.

317
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,580
Watch my back, Baby 5.

318
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,060
I'm the one who can fly.

319
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,560
We'll definitely complete our mission.

320
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,680
Understood.

321
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,570
You need me, right?

322
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,920
I'll stop the attack, even if it costs me my life!

323
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,410
Go!

324
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,320
Weather Egg!

325
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Something's flying at us!

326
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,430
Now hatch from your egg, lightning-chan!

327
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,090
Thunder clouds?

328
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,390
Buffalo, I've got a bad feeling about this!

329
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,330
I'm already flying at full speed!

330
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,230
You're not getting away.

331
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,250
It's weather science! {Sev: It's a really really REALLY long story as to why I changed this.}

332
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,470
Thunder Breed...

333
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,520
No way!

334
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,160
Tempo!

335
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,840
Baby 5!

336
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,200
Dammit, she's unconscious.

337
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,570
Here's the finisher.

338
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,960
Come on, chomping grass.

339
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,980
Deadly...

340
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,370
Shooting Star Rush!

341
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,840
Hey, Buffalo!  Protect me!

342
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,470
I can't move!

343
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,710
O-Of course.  Who do you think I am?

344
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,940
I am part of the Donquixote Family!

345
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,700
I will fulfill my...

346
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,850
What a useless idiot.

347
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,870
Do you really think that'll work, you fool?

348
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,340
I'm made of gas!

349
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,400
I-I have to get to Dressrosa, even if it means going there alone!

350
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,520
It's futile.

351
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,380
The last bullet was...

352
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,140
What is this? {Missing TL. WHAT THE SHYT ARE YOU DOING XEMNAS!?!?!?}

353
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,160

You can leave any enemy who's facing away to-

We get it already.

358

362
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,760
Now, which way to Punk Hazard?
