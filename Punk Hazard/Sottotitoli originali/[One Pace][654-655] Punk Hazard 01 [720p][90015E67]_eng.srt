1
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:38,270
Having left Fishman Island, the ship is finally ascending toward the New World.

2
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,300
Things are going great!

3
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,510
It's going so well, it's almost scary!

4
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,110
Ah, this feels great.

5
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,690
What do you think of my Shower Tempo?

6
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,280
Want to join in?

7
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
Who, me?

8
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,530
I'm fine.  I washed myself two days ago.

9
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,370
I'm more interested in that cloud that looks like cotton candy.  It looks delicious!

10
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,210
It isn't edible.

11
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,960
Really?  You mean it isn't sweet cotton candy?

12
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,960
What?  There's something sweet and tasty
in the shower room?

13
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
It's true.  It really does look sweet and delicious!

14
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,550
Please, Nami-san!

15
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,890
Turn this way!

16
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,100
Chopper, don't get too close to that cloud.

17
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,650
Scary!  I don't want to eat that cloud after all!

18
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,740
This is so relaxing...  
How I've missed Sunny's bath for the past two years!

19
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,920
Taking a bath and looking at the deep sea,
which looks like the night sky...

20
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,090
This is the life!

21
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,510
Will they be alright on deck without you?

22
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,130
I'll get out of the bath
before we enter the rising currents, so it'll be fine.

23
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,920
If any sea monsters appear,
I'm sure they can handle them.

24
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,930
Hurry, Usopp!

25
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,180
Now, wait just a minute!

26
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,470
We're up against giant fish!
A weak rope wouldn't be able to hold 'em!

27
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,120
Oh my, you seem to be having fun.

28
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,530
I didn't think of it on the way down
because I was too excited about Fishman Island...

29
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,320
but if we catch a deep sea fish and pull it up to the surface...

30
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,630
Sanji can cook it up for us, right?

31
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,450
I hope it'll go well with cola!

32
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,250
Cooking, huh?  Great idea!

33
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,660
I'm looking forward to having a drink
to celebrate our entry into the New World.

34
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,260
So, which one should we go for?

35
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,580
I want one that looks delicious.

36
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,270
Perhaps we should fry that one and eat it with salt?

37
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,690
Fried fish with salt, huh?  Sounds great!

38
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,590
That one might be nice grilled in sweet soy sauce.

39
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,020
Grilled fish, huh?

40
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,060
Oh!  That looks good, too!

41
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,480
If we put mayonnaise on it, it'll definitely taste nice!

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,770
Huh?  Which one?

43
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,000
No, there's no way.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,490
That one will taste nasty no matter how you cook it.

45
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,370
Really?  Well, any one will do.

46
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,960
Sanji can cook anything and make it tasty!

47
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,220
You want to eat that one after all?!

48
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,390
Wait, isn't it a bit too big?!

49
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,020
Quick!  Get it!

50
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,600
{\an8}Sure-Kill Capture Star

51
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,020
Alright!

52
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,320
We caught ourselves a deep sea fish!

53
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,780
I wanna eat it soon!

54
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,780
Still, is that even a fish?

55
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,200
Maybe it's just some old guy?

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Old guy?

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,870
It got turned into bait!

58
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,420
Hey hey hey!  Again?!

59
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,290
They just keep coming!

60
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,710
Hurry and reel it in, Usopp!

61
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,090
Huh?!  No way!

62
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,750
The ship's gonna capsize!

63
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,350
The fish just keep coming!
They're like matryoshka dolls!

64
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,510
Did something happen?  The ship's swaying.

65
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,140
And they're really noisy out on the deck.

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,020
I guess leaving them alone was a bad idea, after all.

67
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,400
{\an8}One Sword Style

68
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,900
{\an8}360 Pound Cannon/Phoenix of 360 Earthly Desires

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,570
Great job, Zoro!

70
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,860
What's all the fuss about?

71
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,240
Hey, Sanji!  Look at this!

72
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,620
I see, great idea!

73
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,910
Cooking a deep sea fish, huh?  I'd love to try it.

74
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,710
More importantly... Why are you cooked?

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,090
And you should be even more excited!

76
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,630
Because there are two more fish inside it!

77
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,340
Anyway, are we still moving up toward the surface?

78
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,060
I have a bad feeling, like we're sinking.

79
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,340
You're probably just imagining it.

80
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
W-What's that?

81
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,730
A giant sea snake!

82
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,820
Right!  Move us closer!  We're gonna eat that too!

83
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,240
We can't pull that with the ship!

84
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,440
Wait!  Could that be...

85
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,540
The Whitestrom?!

86
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,830
A giant white maelstrom, which appears underwater out of nowhere, just like a living dragon!

87
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,670
What?!

88
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,010
An underwater maelstrom?!

89
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,920
Sheesh, those guys are just...

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,010
What?!  This is bad!  Is that the Whitestrom?!

91
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,600
From what I've heard,
any ship that gets caught in this vortex...

92
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,520
reappears days later in an unbelievably distant sea,
with no trace of the crew!

93
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,820
That must mean that everyone dies!

94
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,070
This is really bad after all!  Let's get out of here!

95
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,950
The ship is carried to an unbelievably distant sea?

96
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,410
So... this is like one of those super cool warp zones?!

97
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,330
No, you moron!

98
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,500
Everyone!  Get us away from that vortex, quickly!

99
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Hey!  Here comes the navigator!

100
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,050
We're getting out of here, you idiots!

101
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,580
What's with that fish?!

102
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,220
Oh, we caught it!

103
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
What are you doing?!

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,140
We can't move with that thing attached to the ship!

105
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,560
See?  The fish is getting sucked into the vortex!

106
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,730
Crap!  Get it out!

107
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,440
Aye!

108
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,650
No!  Cut it loose!

109
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,770
What?!  But what about our cooked deep sea fish?!

110
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,940
Which is more important, the fish or our lives?!

111
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,070
I only left you alone for ten minutes!
How could you get us into this much trouble?!

112
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,240
Franky!  Use the Coup de Burst!

113
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,750
No, it's super-too late!

114
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:42,910
Right? { def: i'm not sure what Franky means here }{ tlc: Franky: Nope, it's way too late!  Franky: Isn't that right? Nami: I told you to do it! }

115
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,450
I told you to do it!

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,540
We're getting sucked into the vortex!

117
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,880
This is quite the predicament!

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,170
This is awesome!

119
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,510
Nooo!  We're done for!

120
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,510
I don't wanna die!

121
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,760
Grab on to the ship!

122
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,710
We stopped!

123
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,460
What's this black wall?

124
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,640
That wailing... Is it...

125
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,910
Oh, that scar!

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,990
I'll come see you again!

127
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,590
And when I do, let's have another fight!

128
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,970
Laboon?!

129
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,400
Laboon!

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,360
We will definitely sail around the world
and come back here!

131
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,740
Wait for us!

132
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,330
Laboon!  You've grown this big?!

133
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,540
Don't be ridiculous!
Laboon is in the first half of the Grand Line!

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,130
He's so big, he couldn't even make it through
the hole in the Red Line!

135
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,880
Amazing!

136
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,350
It's like a miracle.
I never thought we'd see a pod of Island Whales.

137
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,640
That one has wounds on its head that look just like Laboon's.

138
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,560
Yeah!  The scars are exactly the same!

139
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,100
What a shock!  It really isn't Laboon?

140
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,140
We're going to deliver Binks' brew...

141
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,570
Laboon!  Stop!

142
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,070
Listen to me!

143
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,490
It's me!  I was part of the Rumbar Pirates!

144
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,030
It's me, Brook!

145
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,080
Come to your senses!
I told you, that's a different whale!

146
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,330
Laboon!

147
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,200
This is no time to be calmly admiring them!

148
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,210
Even if we're out of the maelstrom, we're still in danger!

149
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,080
First of all, we have to do a headcount to make sure nobody got thrown overboard in the vortex!

150
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,340
Nami-san!

151
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,260
Yes!

152
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,300
Robin-chan!

153
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,010
I'm here.

154
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,180
Okay.  We've gotta get out of here in a hurry!

155
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,420
If we collide with these gigantic whales, the ship will take major damage!

156
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,390
Count us too!

157
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,480
Sanji-kun!  It is my shame to admit that the other six crewmates have not yet received honorable deaths!

158
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,030
Nami-san, what are your orders?!

159
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,150
We can stay where we are.

160
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,070
That's right, we're doing just fine, you idiots!

161
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,740
Resume whale watching immediately!

162
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,990
What the hell?!

163
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,110
This enormous pod of whales
is creating its own ocean current.

164
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,160
Trying to resist it will just put us in more danger.

165
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Make sure the sails are open!

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,710
Turn the ship in the same direction that the whales are moving!

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,040
Aye!

168
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,590
Of course... This must be Laboon's homeland.

169
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,680
Are any of his relatives here?!

170
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,890
That's dangerous, Brook!

171
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,310
If anyone here is looking for a small whale
who got separated from the pod fifty years ago...

172
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,390
then don't worry!  He's doing fine,
in a sea on the opposite side of the world!

173
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:41,070
According to Luffy-san, he has grown big and strong!

174
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,320
Please, don't be concerned!

175
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,580
Ride the ocean current!

176
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,280
Right!

177
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,230
{\an8}We're going to deliver Binks's brew,

178
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,150
{\an8}entrusting ourselves to the whims of the ocean breeze and waves.

179
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,820
{\an8}Beyond the tides, even the evening sun is cheerful.

180
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,950
{\an8}The song of birds, drawing circles in the sky.

181
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,400
{\an8}Farewell to the port, to the old hometown.

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,670
{\an8}Let's sing a song with a DON, a song for our departure!

183
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,920
{\an8}The waves of gold and silver turn to splashes of water,

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
{\an8}as we set off for the edge of the sea!

185
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,350
{\an8}We're going to deliver Binks's brew.

186
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,550
{\an8}We are pirates, crossing the seas.

187
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,930
{\an8}The sea is our pillow and the ship is our mattress.

188
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,360
{\an8}The skull is emblazoned on our sail and flag.

189
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,450
{\an8}A storm is coming from the distant sky.

190
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,030
{\an8}The waves are dancing, beat on the drums!

191
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,530
Hey!  You're letting us ride you!

192
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,040
We can let them carry us like this.

193
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,290
{\an8}If you're caught by a treacherous wind, this could be the end,

194
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,500
We all seem to be riding the same rising current.

195
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,710
{\an8}but the sun will always rise in the morning!

196
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,650
Luffy?

197
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,370
I see it!

198
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,450
Let's go, men!

199
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,460
Ten!

200
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
Nine!

201
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,410
Eight!

202
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,330
Seven!

203
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,330
Six!

204
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,510
Five!

205
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,290
Four!

206
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,210
Three!

207
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,160
Two!

208
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,300
One!

209
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,520
We're here!

210
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,270
In the New World!

211
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,060
We did it!

212
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,310
We finally made it here!

213
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,180
The weather's the worst!

214
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,490
Thunderclouds in the sky!

215
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,500
The wind blows fiercely!

216
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,200
The sea is raging!

217
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,160
The compass needles are out of control!

218
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,240
Go!

219
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,460
Yahoo!

220
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,420
What's that?

221
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,340
What?!  Impossible!

222
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,130
A red sea?

223
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,180
Look!  A volcanic eruption!

224
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,390
Listen up, Luffy!

225
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,270
None of the three compass needles point to that island!

226
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,980
It's an anomaly, even in the abnormal New World!

227
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,850
Another eruption!

228
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,980
We can see it right there!

229
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,780
Who cares about the needles?

230
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,440
We're dropping anchor, no matter what you say!

231
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,200
No way!  We can't get any closer than this!

232
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,870
I mean, it's a sea of fire!

233
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,250
I don't get you!

234
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,290
The fire...

235
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,040
It's only a matter of time before the ship catches fire!

236
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,080
No!

237
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,840
The Sunny is super-fireproof!

238
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,630
Even if it shouldn't burn,
there's something wrong with this sea!

239
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,380
Look, the fish are nothing but bones!  Bones!  Bones!

240
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,050
What?  Did you call me?

241
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,850
Hey, what's this?

242
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,600
The Snail Phone is crying.

243
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,270
Hey, what's wrong?!  Does your stomach hurt?

244
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,860
You idiot, that's an emergency signal.

245
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,030
Someone's calling for help.

246
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,900
So, if I pick up the phone,
we can communicate with them?

247
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,690
Wait, Luffy!  Less than fifty percent of emergency signals are real!

248
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,660
The Navy uses this kind of trap all the time,
so that's probably what this is!

249
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,990
If you pick it up and they've got the line bugged, then they'll know we're in the area!

250
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,050
Good point, Robin!

251
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,760
Listen, Luffy,
we ought to think this through carefully bef-

252
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,590
Hello?  My name is Monkey D. Luffy!

253
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,710
I'm the man who's gonna be the Pirate King!

254
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,260
You answered too soon, and you're saying too much!

255
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,180
Please, help me!

256
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,340
What's wrong?!

257
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,690
It's freezing... Is that you, boss?

258
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,650
No, I'm not your boss.

259
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,860
It's cold, you say?

260
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,650
My companions keep getting cut down.

261
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,410
The samurai's gonna kill us all!

262
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,490
Samurai?

263
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,870
Hey, what's your name?! { 8:19, 10:32 }

264
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,700
Where are you?!

265
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,500
It doesn't matter who I am, just save me.

266
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,460
I'm on...

267
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,290
Punk Hazard! { 8:27, 10:40 }

268
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,930
He was killed!

269
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,940
I-Is this...

270
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,430
I suspect foul play.

271
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,480
Of course it's foul play!  He was just murdered!

272
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
The New World is scary!

273
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,450
He could have been acting.  It still might be a trap.

274
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,120
She keeps her composure!

275
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,030
C'mon, Robin-san!

276
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,080
He said samurai, Brook.

277
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,630
Yes, it must be one of those samurai...

278
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,800
The name of the swordsmen from the Wano Kingdom.

279
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,930
The Wano Kingdom is an isolated nation, which never lets outsiders enter.

280
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,390
It doesn't even have any ties to the World Government.

281
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,850
Apparently the swordsmen called samurai
are so strong, even the Navy won't approach them.

282
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,980
The Named Sword Shuusui,
once wielded by a legendary samurai.

283
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,860
If you are its master, this blade should be satisfied.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,670
How frustrating, for this samurai body to fall.

285
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,090
A kingdom like that exists?

286
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,100
But he said he was in Punk Hazard, not the Wano Kingdom.

287
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,770
Did he mean that flaming island?

288
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,980
If he was using a Baby Snail Phone,

289
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,350
then that island is the only one within range.

290
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,520
Alright!  Let's go save that guy!

291
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,570
No!

292
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,280
Luffy, think about it!

293
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,570
Chances are, we're already too late!

294
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,450
Samurai are scary!

295
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,290
I'm scared too!

296
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,170
It doesn't matter who I am, just save me.

297
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm on...

298
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,420
Punk Hazard! { 8:27, 10:40 }

299
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,250
Smoker-san, wasn't that...

300
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,060
Damn it!  What route did they take?!

301
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,520
First there was the incident on Fishman Island,
then the uproar after that...

302
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,020
and if I project their route from that point...

303
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,360
Punk Hazard, huh?  Makes sense.

304
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,650
P-Please stop!  I'll do anything!

305
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,540
I'll do whatever you want!

306
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,000
We want you to burn!

307
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,840
Hot!

308
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,790
Stop it, you brutes!  Stop torturing the pirates!

309
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,880
Tashigi!  We're heading for Punk Hazard.

310
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,590
But Smoker-san, Punk Hazard...

311
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,600
has been uninhabited since it was sealed off
after the incident four years ago!

312
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,810
It makes no sense for people to be there!

313
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:56,610
True, it shouldn't be possible
for any creatures to live there.

314
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,520
But it's worth a look, regardless.

315
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,740
We're setting sail for Punk Hazard!

316
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,150
Huh?  But Vice-Admiral Smoker...

317
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,070
That place is forbidden, didn't you know that?

318
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,070
Don't try to tell to me about the rules, scum!

319
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,000
Right!

320
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,120
That settles it.  The ones who'll go are...

321
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,550
Us.

322
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,050
How exciting.

323
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,500
How depressing.

324
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,850
Oh, you won?  Lucky you!

325
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,020
No, I lost!  Someone trade with me!

326
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,110
Here, have my special giant shellfish lunchbox.

327
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,020
Can't wait to taste it!

328
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,280
Awesome!  She made a pathway of clouds!

329
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,460
Did you learn to make that stuff
 they used back on Sky Island?

330
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,130
It's just clouds,
so you better cross it while it's stable.

331
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,260
Got it!

332
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,430
Alright!

333
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,520
Here goes the scouting party!

334
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,930
We're counting on you, Mini Merry!

335
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,770
Hang in there, you all!

336
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,060
You're so lucky at drawing straws!

337
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,190
We'll be able to go later.

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
Take care!

339
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,150
Usopp, good luck!

340
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,070
Trade places with me!

341
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,950
This giant shellfish is delicious!

342
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,290
Hey, why are you eating that already?!

343
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,820
Oh, we've climbed above the flames!  This is fun!

344
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,000
Now we can get past the sea of fire!

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,590
Will these clouds last until we head back?

346
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,040
Good thing the rain stopped.

347
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,720
Perfect weather for scouting.

348
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,710
But it's so hot!

349
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,930
Nami-san,
does that cloud reach all the way to the island?

350
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,600
I don't know.

351
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,270
I'm so glad I didn't have to accompany Luffy.

352
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,850
I can't stand the heat!

353
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,070
I couldn't let him go alone, after all.

354
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,990
They'll come back
once they see that there's nothing there!

355
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,610
You've thought this through, haven't you?

356
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,620
I'll make a cold dessert out of the giant shellfish for our kind Nami-san right now!

357
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,240
Yay!

358
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,500
See?  That's definitely the entrance!

359
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,590
Now listen, people might have lived here before...

360
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,960
but there's no way they could live here now!

361
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,550
The Snail Phone must have
picked up a transmission from some distant island!

362
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,010
Right, Robin?

363
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,060
It doesn't look pretty, but this is surprisingly tasty.

364
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,890
You too?!  Why are you eating it now?!

365
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,310
Aren't you not gonna eat?

366
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,930
I couldn't swallow anything right now!

367
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,640
Ah, I'm having an unexpected relapse
of my disease from two years ago!

368
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,320
Hey, you guys... Honestly,
I've got the "I can't enter that island"-disease!

369
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,820
I know.

370
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,960
No doubt about it.  This is the right place.

371
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,630
So this is Punk Hazard?

372
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,760
Let's get the Merry onto the island.

373
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,460
So the emergency signal
came from this place after all?

374
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,170
Looks like it's forbidden to enter this island.

375
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,100
Luffy, look at that!

376
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,360
Danger... Keep out?

377
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,400
See?  The logos of
the World Government and Navy are here!

378
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,530
So basically, even if someone is inside,
it'll be someone on the Government's side!

379
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,200
This was a waste of time.  Let's go back!

380
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,750
Gah, so hot.

381
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,130
Hey, you guys!
Breaking and entering is a crime, you know!

382
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,220
Oh wait, pirates are criminals.

383
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,180
Don't blame me if you end up
in a fight with the World Government!

384
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,850
Oh wait, we already did that.

385
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,270
H-Hey, wait!

386
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,400
It's so hot... But, anyway...

387
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,730
This whole place is on fire.

388
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,950
It doesn't look like this was always a burning island.

389
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,070
Was there some kind of disaster?  Or an accident?

390
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,040
Hey, Luffy!

391
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,550
Those probably weren't people's houses.

392
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,550
This must have been a government facility.

393
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,060
So was this place sealed off
after it caught fire and became too dangerous?

394
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,690
Or was it a dangerous facility to begin with?

395
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,610
The fact that the Log Pose
isn't pointing to this island bothers me.

396
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,810
Hey!

397
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,690
Guy from earlier, are you here?!

398
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,580
We've come to save you!

399
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,380
Hey!

400
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,540
Come out!

401
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,630
Samurai!

402
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,050
Don't call the murderer!

403
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,430
Did your appetite return?

404
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,590
Shut it!  I'm drowning my sorrows!

405
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,050
Oh yeah, and this has been bothering me for a while...

406
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,020
The guy on the Snail Phone said he was freezing, right?

407
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,470
It's freezing... Is that you, boss?

408
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,740
You've got a point.
It's so hot here, yet he said it was cold.

409
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,610
Maybe he was an idiot?

410
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,570
What kind of reasoning is that?!

411
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,240
Could there be any cold places on this burning island?

412
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,500
Or did he mean that he was so scared that he was getting the chills?

413
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,370
Nami, is something wrong?

414
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,210
Well, the clouds...

415
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,430
The sky above this island is really weird, now that I take a closer look at it.

416
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,350
It almost looks arctic on the far side.

417
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,140
That's impossible!

418
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,440
A giant!

419
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,110
No.

420
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,400
This is way bigger than a giant!

421
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,280
Is that...

422
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,710
W-What?!  D-Do these things really exist?!

423
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:43,430
No, they're fictional creatures!
How could they exist for real?!

424
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,510
But just look at it!

425
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,430
What else could you call it?

426
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,160
A dragon?!
