We drift forward, riding the waves,

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,360
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,630
all under this flag...

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,740
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,290
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

33
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,920
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,840
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,750
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

36
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,460
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

Always step up!

42
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,830

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,160
Hey, open the doors!

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,490
Give us Smokey and Tashigi-chan back!

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,590
What's that?  An airship?

51
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,500
Now then children, time to get off.

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,320
This is your home.

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,080
Don't just wander off again.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,700
Thank you, Master.

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,240
Mister Sheep, candy please...

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,690
Please give us the candy now, Master!

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,050
My head hurts!  Master, please give us the candy...

58
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,560
You'll get the candy soon, of course.

59
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,340
Go straight back to the Biscuits Room.

60
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,930
There's lots of candy waiting for you there.

61
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,130
I have to go to the research room.

62
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,550
So relax and savor it.

63
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,630
The delicious, delicious candy.

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,100
Let's go to the room!  Show us the way, Mister Sheep.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,150
This way, children.

66
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,160
The Biscuits Room.

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,670
Candy... now...

68
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
You!  Listen carefully.

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,400
Once they're in the room, lock them in tight
so that they can't escape again, got it?

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
Roger that.

71
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,570
This place is scary!

72
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,200
What is it, you smelly brat?

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,360
Uh, I mean, young lady?

74
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,010
How about you go with the other children
and eat your delicious candy back in your room?

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,780
What?  What's wrong?

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,760
You don't want to go back to the laboratory, do you?!

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,050
Get out of my way!

78
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,220
Usopp!

79
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,910
Master... please give me candy...

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,930
That's right.  Come on home, children.

81
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,300
Please, stop!  You can't go to him!

82
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,740
You wanna go back to your homes, don't you?

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,230
Heave-ho!

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,540
No!  I really want to leave!

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
What are you talking about, kid?

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,040
It's cold outside,
and didn't you see what floor you're on?

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,490
Now, go back to your room.

88
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,310
No!  Save me, lady!

89
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,430
Mocha?

90
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,890
Let's go get the candy now!

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,940
Oh, right!

92
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,450
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you!

93
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,790
Mister!  Lady!  Save me!

94
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey, you! Get away from the door!

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,570
Geez, what a troublesome brat!

96
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,300
Save me, lady!

97
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,510
Lady!

98
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,270
The Ruins of Laboratories One and Two

99
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,160
Sanji-kun's body took a lot of damage...

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,470
but it's so sturdy.

101
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,330
Usopp!

102
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,220
Hang in there, Usopp!

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,940
You came here to save me, Sanji?

104
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,540
I'm Nami!

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,140
Why are you acting so disappointed?

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,090
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vergo.

107
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,260
Don't worry.  I had some coffee and cookies.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,460
That's strange, where are the cookies?

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,560
I didn't give you any.

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,390
Oh right, I didn't have cookies.

111
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,520
When are you going to begin the experiment, Caesar?

112
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,770
Shortly... Monet, begin the transmission.

113
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,440
Yes, sir.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,700
I really wish that you would keep
your subordinates under control, Vergo.

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,400
I broke into a cold sweat when Smoker came here.

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,320
You're right.  He's a wild dog that can't be leashed.

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,590
But that's all behind us now, isn't it?

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,320
Serves you right, Law!

119
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,180
You were helpless against Vergo, weren't you?

120
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,380
The deal I had with you was useful.

121
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:31,060
In return for being allowed to stay here, you'll give my subordinates legs.

122
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,590
I'd be very thankful.

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,820
However...

124
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,090
You're stronger than me,
but I'm the boss on this island.

125
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,160
If you want to stay here,
we'd better weaken your position somewhat.

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,820
I will not cause you any harm.

127
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,290
What must I do to make you feel safe?

128
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,760
I have a proposition, Trafalgar Law.

129
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,680
I want you to take care of
my dear secretary Monet's heart.

130
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,970
Are you okay with that, Monet?

131
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes, I don't see any problem.

132
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,630
And in exchange... I want your heart!

133
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,960
That's the deal.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,430
As long as we've got each other by the neck, you won't be tempted to do anything funny.

135
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,880
And I can feel secure, too.

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,560
I've always believed that you can't trust anyone.

137
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,980
You reap what you sow, as they say.

138
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,870
You must have already found out...

139
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,990
that now, Vergo has your heart.

140
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,470
Hey!

141
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,570
I suppose that even you couldn't have expected...

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,990
that Monet's smart enough to change her appearance and follow you.

143
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,790
Hey, are you alright, Traf?

144
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,290
She overheard everything that you guys are planning.

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,310
I'm disappointed, Law.

146
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,390
I thought we'd finally become very good friends.

147
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,550
So you were saved by your exceptional secretary?  I should've paid more attention to her.

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,220
I let myself become sloppy
because you're such a blundering idiot.

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,630
Watch your mouth, brat.

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,020
That's amazing.  You're still alive
even though that guy's got your heart?

151
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,970
At the mercy of your own power, Law?

152
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,260
I'd like to know what you did with my heart.

153
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,970
Over here! Smo-

154
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,040
Master, we're ready to start the broadcast.

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
Oh, really?

156
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,700
You escape death, for now.

157
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,420
Okay, begin.

158
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,690
Something's being projected!

159
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,800
What's this?  Where is that?  Is that...

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,090
a candy?  A huge candy!

161
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,000
Little Smileys were scattered from the Blazing Lands...

162
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:25,210
Various New World Locations - Underworld Brokers

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,210
and will soon gather in the middle of the Frozen Lands.

164
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:33,220
Once they all join together again
and become the complete Smiley,

165
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,900
the experiment will begin.

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:57,940
Four years ago, an explosion utterly devastated
this island.  It was a poison gas bomb, called H2S.

167
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,410
That is what Smiley is.

168
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,860
But last time there was a problem.

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:19,210
People who inhaled the poison were weakened
but they were able to find safe places to take shelter.

170
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:27,050
So I plan to give the weapon
from four years ago, Smiley, a huge treat.

171
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,310
One that will supplement the poison gas
to become a flawless weapon of mass destruction.

172
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
Today marks the birth of a new weapon.

173
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,780
Its name will be...

174
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,460
Shinokuni!

175
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,460
{\an8}Land of Death

176
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,900
Frozen Lands - Central Area

177
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,890
It's coming!

178
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,110
Can't we get away from it?

179
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,520
It has completely merged together on this side!

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,050
Just what is that thing?

181
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,940
No time to worry about it.  Just focus on running.

182
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,970
Excuse me, everyone.
There appears to be a huge ball ahead!

183
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,240
What's that?

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,300
It's in the shape of a candy?

185
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,350
There are people next to it.

186
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,720
Vegapunk's Dragon (Miniature)

187
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,060
Master, I can confirm a giant, gelatinous creature.

188
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,290
We think that it's Smiley.

189
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,740
Well then, we'll proceed as planned
and project Master's broadcast onto the mist.

190
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,050
Good.

191
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,610
Once you finish the job,
you have to escape or you'll be in grave danger.

192
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,280
Get on the dragon sleigh and hurry-

193
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
What happened?

194
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,150
We...

195
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,550
We've got a problem with the sled.  It appears to be melting!

196
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,490
We can't use it like this!

197
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,750
Why'd this happen now?!

198
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,590
Is this some kind of chemical reaction?  It's completely useless now.

199
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,320
The dragon is running away!

200
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,900
One thing after another!

201
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,830
What?!

202
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,160
What a terrible thing to happen!

203
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,090
Not very convincing.

204
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,970
Guys, just run!

205
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,220
Your protective suits are useless now!

206
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,770
Throw them off and run to the laboratory!

207
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,870
U-Understood.

208
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,420
Take off our suits?

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,760
Master's orders are absolute!  He must have some plan!

210
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,730
Do what he tells you!

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,580
H-Hurry up!

212
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,530
Turn on, damn you!

213
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,570
What?  Now someone's image is being projected into the air!

214
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,160
Ignore it.  Just ignore it.  Anyway, just run!

215
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,120
Smiley!  I missed you!

216
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,540
It's been three long years!

217
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,030
Oh, yes, Smiley!

218
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,830
This brings back so many memories! 
I've prepared a very, very tasty treat for you!

219
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,010
Stay!  Stay now, Smiley!

220
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,740
Just a little bit longer!

221
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,320
Your Master's orders are absolute!

222
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,040
That's how I trained you.

223
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,310
Stay!  I told you to stay!

224
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,980
I have so much I want to talk to you about!
Do you remember?

225
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,250
It all started, yes, four years ago...

226
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,220
A-Alright!

227
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,000
Alright then!  You can eat now!  Good boy!

228
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,280
He isn't listening to you.

229
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,600
He ate it.

230
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,370
He ate it!  He ate the treat!

231
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,950
You ate it, didn't you, Smiley?

232
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,470
Be reborn.

233
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,970
So it'll become something even more terrifying?

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,460
A perfect weapon of mass destruction.

235
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,720
That's one big frog!

236
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,530
It's starting.  Something's starting to happen!

237
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,240
But what exactly will happen?

238
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,740
Hell if I know!  But it ain't gonna be good!

239
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,440
Whatever, we just gotta run to the lab,
like Master said.

240
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Dammit!  Why did the sled have to break now?!

241
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,920
Master!

242
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,690
He's acting weird since he ate that candy.

243
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,650
Was the candy really so delicious?

244
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,410
We must make haste!

245
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,950
Even those who defend this island are running for their lives.

246
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,080
It does not bode well for things to come.

247
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,740
I agree.

248
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,940
Well done, Smiley.

249
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,980
Farewell.

250
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,390
Greetings to the newborn...

251
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,550
The weapon of mass destruction, Shinokuni!

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,600
Change the landscape of this island forever!

253
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,070
Hey! Wait for m-

254
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,680
My legs!

255
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,790
What's going on?

256
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,490
Save me...

257
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,360
What happened to him?!

258
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,550
Does it matter?!  Just run!

259
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,410
My body...

260
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,030
won't... mo...

261
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,770
Run!  Just run!

262
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,980
Master!

263
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,530
Yes!  It was a success!

264
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,150
Not a single soul can escape!

265
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,940
This is perfect.

266
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,020
The problem with the previous experiment was that there were survivors.

267
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,150
The poison worked but they could still move a bit
so they managed to escape.

268
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,660
But!

269
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,920
It would've worked much better
if I had been able to freeze them!

270
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,330
This gas coats the body like ash.

271
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,360
It is absorbed through the skin and paralyzes the entire body.

272
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,090
Now, my perfect weapon of
mass destruction, Shinokuni!

273
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,460
Show me more!  Show me the ultimate hellscape!

274
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,780
What is this?

275
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,870
The people are...

276
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,060
Save me!

277
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,900
...freezing solid!

278
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,730
Hey... what is this?

279
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,100
What is this terrifying video?

280
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,950
The ones who died looked like Caesar's subordinates.

281
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,390
What the hell is that purple smoke?

282
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,910
By the way, what country are they showing?

283
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,720
Well, you better not look behind you.

284
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,880
No way!  It was happening on this island?!

285
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,250
Master!

286
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,050
Crap!  If we don't run, we'll end up like them!

287
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,330
It doesn't matter!
There isn't anywhere on this island we can run to!

288
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,990
Oh, I see!  That's why they sealed the laboratory!

289
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,770
To keep the gas out!

290
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,200
Open up!  Caesar!  Dammit!

291
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,460
I ain't gonna die out here like that!

292
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,810
Dammit!  Dammit!  Quit messing around!

293
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,720
Open up!

294
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,050
Run away!

295
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,980
Things don't look good!

296
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,060
You guys run as fast as you can!

297
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,740
If you get caught, I'm leaving you behind!

298
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,020
Zoro-san!  At this rate, we're all going to...

299
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,540
Unidentified object spotted at 12 o'clock!

300
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,430
What is that?!

301
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,780
It's a...

302
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,150
dragon!

303
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,470
A dragon?!

304
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,790
A dragon?!

305
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,530
Don't be stupid!  Dragons aren't real!

306
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,170
They have them on this island!

307
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,590
But this one is a lot smaller than the first one.

308
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,910
Hey.  Maybe we can capture it and fly away!

309
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,440
That's a splendid idea!

310
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,520
It's decided!  We can't keep this up forever!

311
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
We're gonna capture him!

312
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,020
Hold it right there, Dragon!

313
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,700
It's my crew!  They're being chased by the smoke!

314
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,610
Dragon!

315
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,730
What are they doing out there?

316
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,470
And what kind of running do they call that?

317
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,110
It seems the samurai's body is complete again.

318
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,360
Hey, you're right.

319
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,800
So I guess he won't be giving me his legs again.

320
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,170
Hey Robin!  This isn't the time for that!

321
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,180
Hey, you guys!  That smoke's bad stuff!

322
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,050
Run awa...

323
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,550
It's impossible.  If I try to yell...

324
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,390
Damn Sea Stone.

325
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,570
Oh, are they your friends, Straw Hat Luffy?

326
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,330
As I'd expect from the great
Straw Hat Pirates, they're quite tough.

327
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,350
But they're just seconds away from
being killed by the gas.

328
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,900
And it'll continue to spread...

329
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,230
until nothing can live on this island.  A land of death!

330
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,060
Nobody outside of this laboratory will be able to survive.

331
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,120
Of course...

332
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,930
that will include you, too!

333
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,290
What?!

334
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,790
Now, let's show the world...

335
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,390
that against my weapon of
mass destruction, Shinokuni...

336
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,960
a 400 million bounty,

337
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,780
a Navy Vice-Admiral,

338
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,070
and even one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,

339
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,890
are all helpless to save themselves from dying!

340
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,690
What should I do?  What should I do?

341
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,410
He's doing something with Luffy and the others!

342
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,000
What should I do?

343
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,910
I want to save them, but with this injured body I'd just get captured.

344
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:28,040
If that happens, then all my efforts to investigate the drug and get the sedatives, will be wasted.

345
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,600
What should I do?  What should I do?

346
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,240
That was dangerous. I was almost spotted.

347
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,750
Hm?  Paper?

348
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,100
"Don't do anything"?

349
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Who threw this?

350
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,000
Could it be?

351
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,540
Smokey!

352
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
Tashigi-chan!

353
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,870
Thank goodness you're okay!

354
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,850
No... They're still captive!

355
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,230
Dammit!  We're all gonna get killed after all!

356
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,330
Smokey!  Tashigi-chan!

357
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,260
Our men?

358
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,990
But more importantly,

359
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,850
That really is a well-equipped laboratory.

360
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,830
You're right.

361
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,920
I bet a facility like that would have
the means to transport large machinery.

362
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,150
Why would you discuss
such things at a time like this?!

363
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,420
Hm, alright!  At any rate, we're stuck.

364
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,670
I hadn't anticipated Vergo's arrival, but nonetheless...

365
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,980
Straw-hatter.

366
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,800
We don't have time to dawdle about in here.

367
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,190
The plan hasn't changed.

368
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,270
Make sure you don't mess up from here on out.

369
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,320
It's time for our counterattack.
