Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,320
So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,730
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:30,690

Always step up!

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,880
Fly over the waves!

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,470
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,700
Now let's head for the future!

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,090
We drift forward, riding the waves,

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,330
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,600
all under this flag...

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,710
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,240
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,890
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

30
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,780
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,730
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,410
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

Now let's keep moving forward!

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,240
Always look up!

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,550

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,930

Alright! Let's go, G-5!

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,870
Obey Captain-chan! Move your asses and save the kids!

44
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,800
I thought Caesar was the only Logia here.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,170
We don't stand a chance against her.

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,110
Black Leg bro, why didn't you help us when she attacked?

47
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,130
Don't be spoiled brats. I would never kick a woman!

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,410
What if a woman was going to kill you?

49
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,770
Then I choose death.

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,380
That's just crazy!

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,560
There's all kinds of people in your crew, isn't there?

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,390
Yeah, Pirate Hunter bro looked like he was attacking her without mercy.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,100
He's actually quite the softy, but he'll get the job done.

54
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,670
We can leave it to him.

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,930
We don't have to worry about Tashigi-chan, either.

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,770
Anyway...

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,890
Nami-san, Robin-chan and Tashigi-chan will praise us...

58
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,820
if we go save those damn brats!

59
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,450
Yeah!

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,470
Biscuits Room
In Front of the Exit

61
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,800
{\an8}You should get out of here too.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
{\an8}I'm free to do what I want.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,010
{\an8}I'm saying that you're in the way!

64
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,820
{\an8}You're free to believe whatever you want.

65
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,620
Okay, then...

66
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,890
Is a pirate like me free to cut you down first, female marine?

67
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,550
I don't think so.

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,900
You're not going to cut me down.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,850
And you're not going to cut her down, either.

70
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,070
You don't know that!

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,820
I was thinking the same thing.

72
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,970
It must be true.

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,740
Why won't you finish the job?!

74
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,280
Is it because I'm a woman?!

75
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,140
I can't stand the fact that you exist!

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,060
Listen! It's that face of yours!

77
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,250
It looks exactly like my friend's who died a long time ago!

78
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,690
And now you're even saying the same things she said!

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,990
Quit imitating her, you copycat!

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,930
What a childish thing to say!

81
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,650
You think women are weak, so you don't use your full strength, and won't finish them off!

82
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,830
You might not lose, but you can't win either!

83
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,080
That's why I stayed here!

84
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,790
If this Logia user went after my subordinates, the casualties would be enormous!

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,370
Are you mocking me?!

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes.

87
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,640
Do whatever you want.

88
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,730
It was my job to stop this woman from attacking my comrades, as well.

89
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,200
So as long as this corridor is protected there's no problem.

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,150
How can you be so carefree?

91
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,270
We're running out of time. You should run as well!

92
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,280
Don't let your guard down.

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,120
The enemy's trying to kill you.

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,550
That's right!

95
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,400
Thank you for telling me his weakness.

96
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,780
You may be able to use a little Haki but my bite will still kill you easily!

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,250
How annoying!

98
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,430
But even if Haki lets you wound a Logia,

99
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,280
it won't mean anything if I'm too fast for you to catch me.

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,100
Isn't that right?!

101
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,270
You're a cold man.

102
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,710
I don't want to hear that from a snow woman.

103
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,400
Don't look away!

104
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,240
Do you like snowball fights?

105
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,640
Snow Rabbit!

106
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,330
Shave!

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,480
You are Smoker's right hand woman.

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,660
Perhaps I underestimated you.

109
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,630
Blizzard!

110
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,300
Hey, hey.

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,220
I'll be sure to let your subordinates know...

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,950
all about your pathetic death.

113
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,330
What's happened to my shoulder?!{From 612}

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,450
What are you doing?!

115
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,960
Let go of me!

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,230
If I let go, she'll rip my shoulder off.

117
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,740
I can just crush your shoulder, if you prefer!

118
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,250
For all your boasting, you're sure taking a long time to finish this.

119
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,610
You're out of time.

120
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,570
I'm heading on ahead.

121
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,170
I thought that he wouldn't attack a woman...

122
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,650
but he just attacked with the intent to hurt me!

123
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,970
You really underestimated me, snow-woman.

124
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,540
You should have run away earlier...

125
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,360
when you realized that you couldn't defeat me.

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,980
There are some things that I don't want to slice up.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,240
But...

128
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:53,860
have you ever met a wild beast who promised that they wouldn't bite?

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,410
Because I haven't.

130
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,860
W-What is this?!

131
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,460
My body won't move!

132
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,040
One Sword Style...

133
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,770
He's going to cut me down!

134
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,850
Great Dragon Shock!

135
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,600
Are you two satisfied now?

136
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,400
He cut her!

137
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,070
Are you... mocking me?!

138
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,990
She's still alive!

139
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,440
Don't tell me he didn't use Haki?

140
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,440
She can't control her own body.

141
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,680
She knows she'd have died if he had used Haki, and she's overwhelmed by fear of his strength.

142
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,470
I've never seen someone win a fight like this.

143
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,380
What could the Straw Hat Crew have been doing for the past two years while they were hiding?

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,180
Just how strong have they become?

145
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,780
I won't let you escape!

146
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,070
Cutting Autumn Rain!

147
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,400
You have lost this fight!

148
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,190
What was the meaning of that?

149
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,340
You didn't deliver the finishing blow.

150
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,160
It's just like I said, you think-

151
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,470
You butted in, so you can't talk.

152
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,020
If you hadn't done it then I would have.

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,790
Stop lying! You're only saying that because I've already done it.

154
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,580
Your help was not needed.

155
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,490
Well...

156
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,220
Good job Captain Glasses. You didn't let her go after anyone.

157
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,150
You can have all the credit.

158
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,660
Why do you always talk like you're superior to me?

159
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,500
Because you're inferior to me.

160
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,740
Mocha! Give us the candy!

161
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,880
Lady!

162
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,810
Now let's go!

163
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Let go of me! What are you doing?!

164
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,890
Stay still. I'm giving you a sedative.

165
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,870
Huh? Where am I?

166
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
This won't stop us!

167
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,650
Oh no! We have to chase after the kids!

168
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,420
Alright.

169
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,220
Give us the candy!

170
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,590
Wait!

171
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,930
Milky Ball!

172
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,700
Not again!

173
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,960
This isn't going to work forever.

174
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,760
How long do I have to hold them off?!

175
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,260
What is this place?

176
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,870
I don't know which way to go anymore!

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,470
The killer gas is leaking into the Biscuits Room?

180
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,410
What now?!

181
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,900
This isn't the way to the exit!

182
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,750
Please put me down before we catch up to my men.

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,970
Why are you always so prideful?

184
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,240
Do you want me to drop you right now?!

185
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
What now?!

186
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,450
Isn't this the legendary named sword, Shuusui?!

187
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,450
{\an8}Shuusui: Clear Autumn Water

188
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,590
Don't touch it!
Just shut up and let me carry you, you sword geek!

189
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,530
No!

190
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,320
Mocha?

191
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,270
Konbu, Biyo, stop it! Please listen to me!

192
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,510
Mocha!

193
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,580
Oh no! Some of the children cut her off!

194
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,870
This is terrible! If they get the candy, they'll fall right back into their addiction!

195
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,100
We have to get those kids away from Mocha!

196
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,440
I wanna go home!

197
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,460
Mocha ate all of it!

198
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,350
Mocha!

199
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,680
How could she be so stupid?

200
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,250
Give it back, Mocha!

201
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,730
You gotta be kidding me!

202
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,600
Don't hog it all, you idiot!

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,240
Mocha!

204
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,910
Don't do it! Spit it all out!

205
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,200
Mocha, can you hear me?!

206
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,380
Mocha!

207
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,530
I told you what that drug was, didn't I?!

208
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,870
Chopper-chan.

209
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,030
They're all...

210
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,350
my friends!

211
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,990
Don't do it!

212
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,360
I promise!

213
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,050
Once we grow up...

214
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,550
When we're all grown up, we should go out to sea.

215
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,690
The sea?

216
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,030
You mean become fishermen?

217
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,400
Don't be stupid, I mean we should go on an adventure.

218
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,180
Let's go find stuff like islands made of gold!

219
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,050
Sounds fun!

220
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,280
Once we've recovered and we go back to our islands,

221
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,540
we'll all be apart.

222
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,030
If we go out to sea when we grow up, we can meet up again.

223
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,070
Oh, I see.  Great! I don't want to leave my friends.

224
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,370
So when are we gonna go?

225
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,430
Hmmm, how about...

226
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,630
When we turn twenty!

227
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,590
That's so far off.

228
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,550
That'll just make it more exciting, right?

229
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,480
I see!

230
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,710
Then let's promise!

231
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,310
So, Master is a bad guy?

232
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,880
Yeah. He's as bad as they come.

233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,140
But he's always so nice to us.

234
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,010
The candy he gives us every day is so tasty!

235
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,150
It's all part of his trap.

236
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,830
No way, but...

237
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,520
You're... his test subjects.

238
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,570
T-Test subjects?

239
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,590
Mocha, open the door!

240
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,510
We're going to Biscuits Room!

241
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,050
You were never really sick!

242
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,360
T-That's impo-

243
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,690
Your big bodies are proof.

244
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,510
Turning humans into giants as a tool of war...

245
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,430
is something scientists all around the world have been trying to do for centuries.

246
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,410
In other words, their experiments have failed over and over for centuries. Nobody has succeeded.

247
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,640
There's no easy way to say this...

248
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,510
This experiment...

249
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,580
will also fail.

250
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,360
Caesar knows this. All he cares about is gathering data for his next experiment.

251
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,430
So... what's gonna happen to us?

252
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,600
You'll die. None of you will make it home.

253
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,120
That delicious candy is a lethal poison.

254
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,710
It causes your body to break down without you even realizing it!

255
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,040
And yet, if you eat one you'll want another.

256
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,730
The more you eat, the harder it'll be to escape from Caesar's grip!

257
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,540
When you saw the children on the other side of this door, you could see how terrifying it is, right?

258
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,400
I've given you a sedative, but the side effects of the candy and the experiments...

259
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,240
will most likely...

260
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,150
claim your life long before you grow up.

261
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,940
Mocha!

262
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,390
We won't grow up?

263
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,750
We... won't ever get to see our moms and dads again?

264
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,060
That's right. Not unless we get you out of here now.

265
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,060
We never thought that we could die.

266
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,180
We wanted him to help us because we wanted to go home!

267
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,230
We were afraid he might break his promise and keep us for another year because of the unknown disease!

268
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,330
But...

269
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,120
We didn't think we were gonna die!

270
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,080
We thought we were going to grow up!

271
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,200
This isn't what they promised us!

272
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,490
We only ate the candy because they gave it to us!

273
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,760
Nobody thought they were going to die!

274
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,520
I know! You've done nothing wrong!

275
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,190
That's why we're gonna get Caesar, no matter what!

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,030
I can't forgive him!

277
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,640
I'm sorry!

278
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,460
I'm so sorry... that we didn't find you sooner!

279
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,260
Chopper-chan, we...

280
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,680
don't want to die!

281
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,250
I won't let you die!

282
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,740
I swear I'll save you!

283
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,070
Caesar is a strong, evil, terrifying man...

284
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,810
but, you know...

285
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,450
our captain is much stronger!

286
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,780
He'll be the king of these seas someday!

287
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,140
Luffy will definitely beat Caesar!

288
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,160
So listen up... Mocha, right?

289
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,390
We can't let the other kids have the candy, ever again.

290
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,870
I'm going to stay here and do my best to give them the sedative.

291
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,970
So Mocha, will you go to the Biscuits Room and protect the candy there?

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,770
Yeah!

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,260
I understand! I'll never let them eat the candy again!

294
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,590
We're all going to go home together!

295
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,330
Exactly!

296
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,090
Mocha just coughed up blood!

297
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,500
Why'd the delicious candy make her do that?

298
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,990
I can't believe this!

299
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,510
The children have stopped.

300
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,960
See? This is because you were so selfish!

301
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,180
Why?

302
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,860
This is what the candy does to you!

303
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,570
Mocha wanted to save you!

304
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,630
Even if it meant... sacrificing herself!

305
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,350
Chopper, this might be our only chance to calm them down!

306
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,790
But I have to treat Mocha first!

307
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,050
There's no time.

308
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,420
The kids are standing still!

309
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,610
Go!

310
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,590
No violence, alright guys?!

311
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,560
Yeah!

312
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,060
Fight numbers with numbers!

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,440
Hold them down!

314
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,230
Alright!

315
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,360
Sanji-kun?!

316
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,070
The Navy?!

317
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,040
Bro! Does kicking them in the balls count as violence?

318
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,370
It's a little over the line.

319
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,370
Roger that!

320
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,850
Medical team, up front!

321
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,500
Yes, Sir!

322
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,340
Chopper, let these guys help you!

323
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,660
They can handle an injection or two, at least!

324
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,410
Right!

325
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,150
Alright, you're gonna hafta calm down now!

326
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,690
Forward!

327
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,220
I'm pretty sure the examination room is around here somewhere.

328
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,320
Carry her there!

329
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,040
She doesn't have long. You know that, right, Racoon Dog?

330
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,080
I know!

331
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,340
Mocha...

332
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,100
Dammit, this is my fault!

333
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,330
Chopper-chan...

334
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,740
Mocha, are you alright?

335
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,620
I...

336
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,290
I didn't give them the candy!

337
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,430
Yeah! You protected your friends!

338
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,540
Thank you.

339
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,950
Thank you!

340
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,910
Thanks to you, everyone can go home!

341
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,160
Mocha, I promise I'll save you too!

342
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,630
I swear...

343
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,300
you will grow up!

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,300
Thanks!

345
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,080
Building C - Dust Box

346
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,080
{\an8}What?!

347
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,450
Straw Hat Luffy!

348
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,670
Where is Caesar?

349
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,250
H-He's right down this corridor, in Building R!

350
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,320
I see.

351
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,110
I got it.
