Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

So many obstacles are already behind us!

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,770
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

Fly over the waves!

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,480
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,720
Now let's head for the future!

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,130
We drift forward, riding the waves,

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,350
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,630
all under this flag...

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,720
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,270
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,910
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,820
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,770
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,450

One of you little brats turned into a dragon?

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,990
Ah! I mean, little kids!

46
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,390
Missy, where did you hear about that?

47
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,320
I saw it myself.  I was hiding.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,490
It was in the secret room, so I never told anyone.

49
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,360
We came here together on the same boat,
so I'm worried about him.

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,780
Oh, I see. But he's fine.

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,160
This laboratory is huge.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,920
There's plenty of infirmaries,
so he's just been moved somewhere else.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,650
But is he eating now?

54
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,060
Why wasn't he eating?

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,700
No, he's eating. You don't need to worry.

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,490
He's fine.

57
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,860
Listen up. You can never talk about him,
or the secret room, to anyone else.

58
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,700
Building C, 4th Floor - Caesar's Office

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,020
Hey, bird-lady! What're you doing?!

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,200
Ten Layer Igloo!

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,380
It's ten igloos nested one inside the other.

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,580
I can make them one after another,
so it won't break easily.

63
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,850
So what, you're just wasting time?

64
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,480
In that case, I'll break them all at once!

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Stop doing pointless things!

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,390
I'm not planning on losing to you!

67
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,930
I'm sure you're not.

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,010
I'm also sure that I'm not as strong as you.

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,350
But...

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,610
the strongest fighter doesn't always win, do they?

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,290
Cold...

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,760
You're like ice.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,270
Lemme go!

74
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,930
I'm not going to let you go.

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,730
Once in my embrace,
you no longer have the strength to resist.

76
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,450
Already, this cold body of mine
has started to drain your vitality.

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,600
Look, we're surrounded by this thick snow.

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,440
You're irresistibly sleepy, aren't you?

79
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,820
Feels good, doesn't it?

80
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,560
That's right, forget your worries and close your eyes.

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,990
Let it all go.

82
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,110
Jet Spear!

83
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,180
The floor?!

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,990
What a surprising reserve of hidden strength.

85
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,850
But from here you'll just fall into the ducts
and end up deep underground in the garbage dump.

86
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,460
Unless you can fly, you'll never get back up.

87
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,450
You put yourself into your own grave.

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,420
Farewell.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,630
Building B, 3rd Floor - Near Biscuits Room

90
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,860
You must never eat that candy again.

91
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,410
Shut up! Get out of the way!

92
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,100
Don't you want to go home?

93
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,330
I know it's hard, but you have to be strong!

94
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,740
I won't let you past me.

95
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,640
I won't let you into the Biscuits Room!

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,450
Candy!

97
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,470
Stop!

98
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,350
Ow! It hurts!

99
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,070
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you...

100
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,980
Out of the way, you monster!

101
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,540
The candy is ours!

102
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,200
It's over. I can neither fight nor stop them.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,170
Now's our chance!

104
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,860
Let's go to the Biscuits Room!

105
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,360
You can't! You can't go there!

106
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,410
Oh no! The effect of the Rumble Ball is fading.

107
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,920
We can eat the candy!

108
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,250
Candy!

109
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,130
Go to the Biscuits Room!

110
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,810
We can eat candy!

111
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,520
Hey! Wait!

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,220
It's no use. My body won't move, damn it.

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,110
Chopper, what's happening?

114
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,330
Momonosuke! Where are you?!

115
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm so happy you came for me.

116
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,950
Tell us the situation, Chopper!

117
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,960
Just as we thought, Caesar is turning them into giants to create fearsome soldiers.

118
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,900
It's too much for me to handle by myself.

119
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,600
At any rate, please stop the children, quickly!

120
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,290
The Biscuits Room is down the corridor and on the left.

121
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,000
That's where the candy is.

122
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,910
A girl named Mocha is there, all alone.

123
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,130
She's still sane and has been helping me.

124
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,550
Somehow the two of us
managed to hold everyone back for a while...

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,360
but we couldn't stop them.

126
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,910
She's guarding the candy in the Biscuits Room now.

127
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,340
We've made it to the Biscuits Room!

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,250
Candy!

129
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,970
Mocha's in danger!

130
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,270
Mille Fleur...

131
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,270
{\an8}Thousand flowers

132
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,820
Gigantesco Mano!

133
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,820
{\an8}Gigantic Hand

134
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,260
You're in the way!

135
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Stopping them is not gonna be easy.

136
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,810
If they're gonna be like that, they're forcing our hands.

137
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,410
Mocha, give us the candy!

138
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,980
No, you can't! I can't give this to you!

139
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,230
Candy!

140
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,620
This is bad candy!

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,420
Candy!

142
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,570
Pull yourselves together!

143
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,800
We asked Chopper-chan to save us!

144
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,940
Give it!

145
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
No!

146
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,440
If you don't listen to them, we won't be able to go home!

147
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,830
That won't work. Run away! Now, Mocha!

148
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,190
Hey, wait! Hogging it is unfair!

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,320
Get her!

150
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,750
Stop! Are you going to keep it all for yourself?!

151
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,990
What?!

152
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,250
The exit's sealed.

153
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,980
It's Monet-san.

154
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,590
Who's that chick?

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,330
It's her!

156
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,680
Hey, see?! It's the bird-lady I told you about!

157
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,730
Mocha, you shouldn't be selfish.

158
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,590
Split it up and share with everyone.

159
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,550
Building D - SAD Manufacturing Room

160
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,290
Room!

161
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,130
Heart, return!

162
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,880
Counter Shock!

163
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,090
I have a message from Joker.

164
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,560
He says that it's a shame.

165
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,980
It didn't work?

166
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,140
Snatching my heart back from Caesar would have gone according to plan.

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,310
The only thing I didn't expect was your arrival,

168
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,150
Vergo.

169
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,380
It's san!

170
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,010
I'm rather busy at the moment, but I guess you won't wait...

171
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,570
Vice-Admiral Smoker.

172
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,580
I was planning to silence you either way.

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,040
Get it over with, then. I don't think I can stand looking at this trash before me for much longer...

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,820
Pirate Vergo.

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,010
What is this dangerous looking room?

176
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,030
It's something you don't need to know about.

177
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,490
Vergo, I don't want my subordinates to find out about this.

178
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,470
They love you like a father.

179
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,200
To find out that you're Joker's dog...

180
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,640
Oh, it's too late to do anything about that.

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,450
I already met them a few minutes ago.

182
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,950
What did you do?

183
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,340
What indeed?

184
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,880
Vergo!

185
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,820
You seem pretty upset, Smoker-kun.

186
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,540
Are you seriously worried about those misfit Marines?

187
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,260
As base leader I can do whatever I want to my useless subordinates.

188
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,870
And since you guys know too much, I'm gonna have to make you disappear.

189
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,420
It doesn't matter how long you've been with them,

190
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,130
or that you're their base leader.

191
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,140
Since you left the base, they've become my subordinates.

192
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,630
Don't you lay a finger on them!

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,880
Building B, G-5 Group

194
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,020
What happened here?

195
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,600
Hot, hot it's damn hot!

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,170
There's nowhere left to walk.

197
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,590
Just what on earth happened here?!

198
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,980
Hurry it up, bring the injured people to the front.

199
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,080
And protect Tashigi-chan!

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,990
Please stop acting so friendly! We're enemies!

201
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,310
That's only according to society's rules, pirates are free to do what they want.

202
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,040
The way you kicked that fake Vergo is enough to even make a man fall in love with you.

203
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
That was really cool, bro.

204
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,680
Shut it! I said I don't want any cheers from the men!

205
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,790
Please stop calling that pirate "bro"!

206
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,120
A tank exploded!

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,320
This is bad. It punched a hole through the wall.

208
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,390
On the other side too. Damn it all!

209
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,950
Run, you guys!

210
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,130
The gas is leaking in from outside!

211
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,330
It's the killer gas from earlier!

212
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,040
If you don't want to die then start running!

213
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,220
Even this huge space in Building B will be flooded with gas in no time!

214
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,390
Stop whining and get moving!

215
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,020
Tashigi-chan, run!

216
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,570
You'll die if you hesitate! Just focus on going the right way!

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,530
Black Leg!

218
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,070
Hurry up, you guys! You're gonna die at that pace!

219
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,600
Building R, 2nd Floor - The Secret Room

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,870
Those guys are such idiots.

221
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,850
Who would've thought that they'd let in the Shinokuni themselves?

222
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,670
But if they die where they are, it won't be on my experiment broadcast.

223
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,360
Hey, close the gates to Buildings C and D.

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,090
Okay, but what about Building R?

225
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,760
Leave that one open.

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,040
I'm gonna set a trap for those idiots on the first floor of Building R.

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,220
They are heading for Gate 66 in the R-Building.

228
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,010
I'll lead them there to make sure that they don't get sidetracked.

229
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,600
I really hate this room.

230
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,150
The second floor of the Building R - The Secret Room.

231
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,570
I never wanted to use this room.

232
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,310
But I can't let the Straw Hats get away.

233
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,370
They've gotten far too confident.

234
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,030
I have Joker backing me.

235
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,140
Once they're in that room, I'll kill them all.

236
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,180
Master, we finished our preparations for battle a long time ago.

237
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,410
Why did you call us here to the old office of that despicable Vegapunk?

238
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,640
Vegapunk created that incident four years ago, so he is our enemy as well.

239
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,060
Are you sure we should be sitting here doing nothing?

240
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,250
Shouldn't we go and fight them?

241
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,230
Nope, it's fine.

242
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,150
You guys are my special forces,

243
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,570
I don't wish for your blood to be spilled in vain.

244
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,150
M-Master!

245
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,710
Now then, it's time to explain my plan.

246
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,190
I've closed the doors leading to Buildings C and D.

247
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,810
so now all open corridors in the laboratory lead to the room below us,

248
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,060
the first floor of the Building R.

249
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,420
The Straw Hats, G-5 and the children...

250
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,360
All the survivors will end up in this room.

251
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,350
And the first floor of Building R has air vents.

252
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,090
Of course, those air vents will flood it with Shinokuni.

253
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,390
There will be nowhere for them to run.

254
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,340
That way, no one can survive.

255
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,940
With all the gates closed, it will become one big gas chamber.

256
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,110
The video feed from that room is already being sent to all the brokers in the New World.

257
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,880
That way I can show my skill to the entire underworld.

258
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,930
If I may, Master Caesar...

259
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,360
Were you the one that created that horrifying poison gas?

260
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,120
But it looks like the poisonous gas that Dr. Vegapunk released four years ago.

261
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,800
It really creeps us all out.

262
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,060
This is...

263
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,580
a scientific battle for vengeance!

264
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,600
Listen, my subordinates...

265
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,750
On that day, I tried to stop him.

266
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,400
The mad scientist Vegapunk.

267
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,090
"If you lost control of that weapon,

268
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:10,540
just what do you think would happen to all the people on this island? Stop it, Vegapunk!"

269
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,170
But still, the accident occurred.

270
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:23,690
And he continues to lead the Navy's top scientists,

271
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,220
as the world's greatest scientist!

272
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,730
I can't stand it!

273
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,840
Can we really allow the cruel man who hurt all of you...

274
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,320
to keep being praised as the greatest scientist in the world?!

275
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,750
Master!

276
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,780
That's why I have have to prove that I'm better than him!

277
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,780
By creating a weapon of mass destruction even though I didn't want to!

278
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,970
To prove that I am the world's greatest scientist, not him!

279
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,750
When the Navy accepts that, and I'm the science division's lead scientist,

280
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,680
then my dream to use science to bring about world peace can come true!

281
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
Master!

282
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,740
I'm sorry Master. We're ashamed to have ever doubted you.

283
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,800
You really are our god of salvation!

284
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,510
Stop it, Caesar!

285
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,520
Stop the experiment right now!

286
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,340
If you lost control of that weapon,

287
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,000
just what do you think would happen to all the people on this island?

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,870
Silence, you brainless fools!

289
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,280
Where do you think we are?!

290
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,500
It's the Navy's research facility.

291
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,960
They want us to create a weapon that could kill many pirates at once.

292
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,900
They don't want a weapon that would kill innocent civilians as well!

293
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,400
You idiot.

294
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,450
That's what we call acceptable losses.

295
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,240
It's their own fault for being in the line of fire.

296
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,420
If we destroy everything, the world will truly be at peace.

297
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,810
You are so...

298
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,320
Cruel?

299
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,450
Now, isn't that funny!

300
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,940
How is this any different from you experimenting on the prisoners here, like they were garbage?

301
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,310
The current Fleet Admiral Sengoku is naive,

302
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,150
but Admiral Akainu should see the value of my weapon.

303
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,170
Now if you understand, get out of here.

304
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,520
You're in the way!

305
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,880
Vegapunk is just jealous of my genius.

306
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,510
I heard that he failed at gigantification again.

307
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:53,710
This is science, not magic! Humans aren't going to grow into giants without effort!

308
00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:00,110
I told him to kidnap a bunch of growing kids and shove different drugs down their throats.

309
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,660
Wh-

310
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,530
W-What are you doing?!

311
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,890
Stay quiet and come with us.

312
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,230
Vegapunk, what is the meaning of this?!

313
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,940
You have been expelled from the science division.

314
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,170
Your research is far too dangerous.

315
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,410
I can no longer overlook it.

316
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,080
Don't you screw with me!

317
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,700
Stop it, Caesar!

318
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,030
The passageway between Buildings C and B has been sealed.

319
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,850
The passageway between Buildings B and D has been sealed.

320
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,780
It is now impossible to enter Buildings C or D from the Building B.

321
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,160
Run like your lives depend on it!

322
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,690
Building C - Garbage Dump

323
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,180
You just spoke now, didn't you?

324
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,510
What are you?

325
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,830
I...

326
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,870
I would ask that you identify yourself first!
