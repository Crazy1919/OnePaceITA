1
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,160
Don't let up!  Fire!

2
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,160
Punk Hazard Island, Central Lake

3
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,160
-Luffy's Group-

4
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,330
They won't listen to us!

5
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,080
What are you doing now -pooh?!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,500
Legson isn't helping at all!

7
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,060
Oh, a Devil Fruit user, is he?

8
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,150
That makes things easier!

9
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,510
Fire!

10
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,790
Aim directly below their boat!

11
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,640
W-We've gotta retreat!

12
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,030
What are you talking about, Usopp?!

13
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,630
Forward!

14
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,890
You don't understand the situation at all, do you?!

15
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,010
Those guys are trying to sink us into the lake!

16
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,440
You cannot escape from me, Brownbeard-sama!

17
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,140
I'm a former pirate
whose bounty was 80,060,000 beli!

18
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,070
Take my attack of rage!

19
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,280
Dammit!  They...

20
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,160
We're falling!

21
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,680
Oh no!

22
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,830
Alright!  We did it!

23
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,030
That's Boss for ya!

24
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,340
He capsized their boat!

25
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,470
Have you learned your lesson?

26
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,690
Now you can struggle all you like,
until you sink to the ocean floor!

27
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,850
Aaaah!  It's so cold!

28
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,490
More than a few minutes here and we'll become icicles!

29
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Y-You had plenty of time to fight back, Luffy!

30
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,960
But you kept on saying such dumb things.

31
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,580
So... you should be more careful what...

32
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,460
Sowwy... It'th awright...
I dun' wanna make'em my friendth anymo'...

33
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,470
Alright, finish them off!

34
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,010
Hey, Usopp!

35
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,650
Take both of them for me!

36
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,350
I'm gonna slice'em up!

37
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,150
H-Hurry... I'm almost...

38
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,140
I'll finish this quickly!

39
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
Hey!  What's wrong, Zoro?!

40
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,250
Sharks!  Why are there sharks in the lake?!

41
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,200
You fool!  This is technically the ocean!

42
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,070
This hole was ground zero of the fight
between Aokiji and Akainu.

43
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,750
Cracks tore right through the island,
so sea water flowed in and made this lake!

44
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,270
Of course there are ocean creatures here!

45
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,920
Zoro!

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,040
Sharks!  Scary!  Sharks!

47
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,060
Zoro got eaten by sharks!

48
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,040
Aim carefully!  They can't do anything now!

49
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,740
They're everywhere!  We're doomed!

50
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,200
Blast them to smithereens!

51
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,610
Why?!  I never imagined my life would end like this!

52
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,010
This is the end!

53
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,500
Fire!

54
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,350
What?!  What happened?!

55
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,210
Brook!

56
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,230
Most frigid of winds,

57
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,160
cuts colder than the arctic.

58
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,920
Feel the underworld.

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,500
Damn you, you filth!

60
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,940
Ah, I did not have time to warn you.

61
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,970
I froze your gunbarrels...

62
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,580
so if you shoot, they will explode in your faces!

63
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Who are you, skeleton-mask?!

64
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,760
You are unworthy to hear my name.

65
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,870
It's Brook.

66
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,190
You still told it to me?

67
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,250
I returned from the underworld,

68
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,200
and dedicated my second life
to my captain with the straw hat!

69
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,820
I am known as the Soul King!

70
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,180
When did he pull that trick with our guns?!

71
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,840
We won't let you get away with this, you damn-

72
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,250
"Won't let you get away with this?"

73
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,990
That's my line!

74
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,830
Damn you!

75
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,150
How dare you?!

76
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,170
I will not lose my crewmates a second time!

77
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,170
Only ice!

78
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,810
Damn he's fast!  He's too strong!

79
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,520
The sharks have all been killed!

80
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,030
Hey!  Where did they go?!

81
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,370
Here!

82
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,530
You came at a perfect time, Brook.

83
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm glad you're alright!

84
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,250
As it happens, I was chased here by a strange fellow...

85
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,450
You've really done it now,
you half-man half-beast freaks!

86
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,900
Do you really think my training was so weak...

87
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,770
that I'd die to something as trivial as sharks?!

88
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,790
But... the human body... can't train against the cold...

89
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,700
Freezing... I'm turning into ice!

90
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,880
I told you... you guys...

91
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,700
that trying to cross the frozen lands...

92
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,440
in these clothes...

93
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,950
But look... We're in luck.

94
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,650
We should be thankful... that we met them.

95
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,090
Boss!  We won't let them take another step!

96
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,520
Wait!  There's something familiar about these guys!

97
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
That one will do...

98
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,230
I'm going with the fourth guy from the right!

99
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,430
I've decided...  I'll take the one next to him!

100
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,310
I'll take that one...

101
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,730
The one that girl at the far left is wearing...

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,130
What are they saying?

103
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,940
Those clothes look so warm!

104
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,790
Alright, go!

105
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,630
Get one for me, too!

106
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,840
Are they... coming for our coats?!

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,130
How crude!  What are they, highwaymen?

108
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,990
Now I remember!  It's that hat!

109
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,110
That's one of the rookies
from the Worst Generation two years ago!

110
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,580
That's right... He's Fire-Fist's little brother!

111
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,820
The pirate worth four hundred million, Straw Hat Luffy!

112
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,490
F-Four hundred million?!

113
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,590
Help me!

114
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,510
Hurry!

115
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,680
This way, children!

116
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,640
We've gotta find the back door!

117
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,260
Wait!

118
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,430
Go back!

119
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,680
It was that man!  It was he who cut me down!

120
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,620
What?  Really?!

121
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,520
So does he have your body?

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,610
No... he most likely does not, however...

123
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,630
Then this can wait until later!

124
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,780
Please, wait!  He might know something!

125
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,200
Our first priority is to find a backdoor!
We're not going back to meet the Navy!

126
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,630
The samurai was with them.

127
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,050
Hurry!

128
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,320
I can't let the Straw Hats escape, either.

129
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,200
What's this?!

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,850
It's like some sort of thin film or something.

131
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,680
What was that?  It felt weird...

132
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,880
I guess that's not important right now!

133
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,020
Now hurry and run, damn kids!

134
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
Huh?  Did I drop my cigarette?

135
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,640
Follow me!

136
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,650
Sheesh, what are you doing now, Sanji-kun?!

137
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm particularly super this week!  Finding a backdoor will be easy!

138
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,410
Guys?

139
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,980
Pull back, Vice-Admiral!
His power is just too damn creepy!

140
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,280
We can't fight this guy!

141
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,160
I can't allow a single one of you to escape.

142
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,680
He attached it to the bedrock of the island?!

143
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,550
He reshaped the ship into some weird object!

144
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,850
Dammit!  Without the ship, we can't get back to base!

145
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,360
The Warlords report to the Government!

146
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,960
Attacking us is against the rules, you know!

147
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,110
Trafalgar!

148
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,900
I'll report this to HQ!

149
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,910
You'll be stripped of your position!

150
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,910
No need to worry.

151
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,890
What's this?!  Cut it out!

152
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,710
Huh?  Snail Phones?

153
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,640
What?  It's gone!

154
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,800
No way... Mine too?!

155
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,310
Those are ours!

156
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,680
He took all our Snail Phones!

157
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:16,190
I cannot let you report anything you've seen
on this island, not to the Government or HQ!

158
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,960
Do you think we're just going
to let you act like the pirate you've always been?!

159
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,530
Smokey!

160
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,100
Even if you are a surgery-man who ate
the Ope Ope Fruit, and can operate on everything!

161
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,620
Don't get in the way of his attacks, men!

162
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,340
He cut me!

163
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,550
Huh?  I'm alive...

164
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,650
You're in my way!  Get out of the circle!

165
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,530
Circle?!

166
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,880
As long as you're inside the circle that Law created,

167
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,820
you're like patients strapped to his operating table!

168
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,940
This is his operating room.

169
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,500
He can freely control and operate on
anything within this space.

170
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,160
He is the Surgeon of Death!

171
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,790
Trafalgar!

172
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,370
If that's what you're trying to do...

173
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,000
Stop it, Tashigi!

174
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,290
Your Haki is no match for him!

175
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,140
Captain-chan!

176
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,190
C-Captain-chan got cut in half!

177
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,780
Hey!  You're still alive, right, Tashigi-chan?! {Normally I would point out the absurdity of that question... But then again, there's a dude holding a still-living detached head in this shot.}

178
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,970
What...

179
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,820
What a disgrace!

180
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,500
To lose a swordfight without fighting to the death.

181
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
If you're going to cut me, then kill me, Trafalgar!

182
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,650
You have the attitude of a master swordsman,
if nothing else.

183
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,600
Remember this, Miss Marine!

184
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,120
The weak don't get to decide anything, not even how they die.

185
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,620
Damn you!

186
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,220
That sword...

187
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,620
can't even reach me.

188
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,970
But if this is what you want, I will gladly cut you again.

189
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,870
You bastard!  Don't humiliate Captain-chan!

190
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,550
Captain-chan, leave this to us!

191
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,520
That messed up bastard is gonna be filled with holes!

192
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,550
Bullets?!

193
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,000
Where'd those bullets come from?!

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,960
Where'd our bullets go?!

195
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,650
Those were the bullets you fired.

196
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,460
I swapped them with the snow over there.

197
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,490
Is he invincible?!

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,940
Get down! He's planning to cut us again!

199
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,960
There's no way to block his attacks!

200
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,350
That bastard!

201
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,380
Captain-chan, run!

202
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,420
Captain-chan!

203
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,850
Smokey!

204
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,110
Surgeon of Death... Trafalgar Law!

205
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,540
I can sense a nasty energy.

206
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,380
The tip of that jutte is made of Sea Stone, isn't it?

207
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,420
Watch out!  That crazy thing he made...

208
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,560
The ship's falling!

209
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,020
Let's get out of here as fast as we can!
We're just in the way!

210
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,160
Captain-chan, we've gotta get out of here!

211
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,030
But...

212
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,830
They're way out of our league!

213
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,980
Run!  Get out of the circle!

214
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,260
The frozen lands

215
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,260
- Luffy's Group -

216
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,300
That was really loud.  Maybe it's Sanji and the others?

217
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,100
Hey, Crocotaur!
You sure you don't know anything about my friends?

218
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,680
Shut up!  I'm not telling you anything!

219
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,190
Fine!  Then run faster!

220
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,180
How humiliating, he's just a kid...

221
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,440
and he cruelly stole my underlings' coats!
You damn highwaymen!

222
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,210
This crocodile-guy
doesn't seem to regret his actions at all.

223
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,510
Anyway, Brook...
You've got no skin, so it can't be cold for you, right?

224
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,920
Why did you take a coat as well?

225
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,010
I do have feelings.

226
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,590
I feel sorry for Nami and the others.  They didn't change clothes before they were kidnapped.

227
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,210
I hope their arms and legs haven't fallen off from frostbite.

228
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,440
Stop it, Robin!  Don't worry in such a cruel way! {No really. That is literally how he phrased it. "Cruel way of worrying".}

229
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,980
Master, what do we do?

230
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,230
Sir Law and Smoker are fighting a huge battle.

231
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,800
What is Law thinking?

232
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,030
The plan was to just chase them away.

233
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,300
Well, the pirates who had escaped earlier...

234
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,200
took the kids from the Biscuits Room...
and ran into Law and Smoker at the entrance!

235
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,250
Did the Navy see the kids?!

236
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,620
Yes.

237
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,650
So the worst has happened.

238
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,020
This means that the island will be investigated!

239
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,160
Even if we wipe out Smoker now,
the Navy would surely become suspicious!

240
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,100
Those pirates are in here, after all.

241
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,750
Why are you back so soon, Monet?

242
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,740
This is them, no doubt about it.

243
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,690
Perhaps we should have been more careful?

244
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,820
Oh, right, I forgot to mention...

245
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,450
Vegapunk's dragon and Brownbeard's Centaur squad
have both been defeated.

246
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,950
What?!

247
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,910
Impossible!

248
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,040
In other words, the crew you kidnapped, ship and all, had other members...

249
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,050
who had found their way into the burning lands.

250
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Now they've crossed the lake, and are almost here.

251
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,860
I thought they seemed oddly strong, and what do you know...

252
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,730
{\an8}Newspaper: The Straw Hat Pirates Back at Full Strength

253
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,730
It's really them, isn't it?

254
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,360
The Straw Hat... Pirates?

255
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,370
The ship's flying around like a leaf!

256
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,750
Captain-chan, how's your body?

257
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,120
Did we manage to reattach it properly?

258
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,480
Hey, that right arm of yours... That's my left leg!

259
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,780
Whose feet are my arms?!

260
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,960
This is awful!

261
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,800
We can't contact HQ, and we have no ship!

262
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,470
I thought the Seven Warlords were our allies!

263
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,980
Tashigi, remember this.

264
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,370
No matter what, pirates will always be pirates.

265
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,700
Pirates... will be pirates.

266
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,370
I never trusted you Warlords to begin with.

267
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,340
That may be wise.

268
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,780
Law!

269
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,620
Is this place important to you?!

270
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,580
You must be getting orders from someone!

271
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,420
What are you scheming... on this island?!

272
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,220
First answer me!

273
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,180
What are your schemes?!

274
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,080
You can't see the whole picture
until you look at it from the outside.

275
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,420
Smoker!

276
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,280
My heart...

277
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,940
I don't have to tell you anything.
