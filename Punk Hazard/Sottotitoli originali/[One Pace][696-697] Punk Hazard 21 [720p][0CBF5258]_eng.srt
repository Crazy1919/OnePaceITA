Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,840
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,370
So many obstacles are already behind us!

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,780
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,740
"I'm almost there, just a little further and I'll have the answer."

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:54,020
We're connected by unwavering bonds, let's head for a bright future!

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,690
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,470
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,860
So many obstacles are already behind us!

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,880
Now let's keep moving forward!

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
Always look up!

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,600
Keep your head held high!

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,040
Always step up!

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,940
Fly over the waves!

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,510
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,750
Now let's head for the future!

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:31,150
We drift forward, riding the waves,

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,390
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,630
all under this flag...

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,770
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,300
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,940
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,840
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,780
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,470
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,750
So many obstacles are already behind us!

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,910
Now let's keep moving forward!

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
Always look up!

38
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,600
Keep your head held high!

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,980
Always step up!

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,830
Fly over the waves!

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,540
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,020
Now let's head for the future!

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,070
{\an5}The Alliance's Target and the Departure!

44
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,080
Listen up, you damn pirates!

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,750
You pirates can have the tanker!

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,810
And this is the line between good and evil!

47
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,690
Don't you dare cross this line!

48
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,930
You get that, Straw Hat Pirates?!

49
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,650
That's right!

50
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,480
Who told you to do something so ridiculous?

51
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,960
All I said was to not get too friendly with the pirates.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,510
If we're gonna do it, then we should do it properly,
Vice-Admiral Smo.

53
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,230
But the line doesn't count for medical teams.

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,230
I already made contact with the G-5 base.

55
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,800
We wait here until a ship comes to pick us up.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,070
Yes, sir!

57
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,480
Really?!  You're giving yourself up, Brownbeard?

58
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,010
We just became friends!

59
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,220
Apparently, the experiments that were performed on us
were a little poisonous. {Sev: SD raw, showing as 3line for me but I won't touch it socky}

60
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,590
We'll be treated if we turn ourselves in.

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,390
I get it now.

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,230
Hey hey, Straw Hat!

63
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,140
I just told you not to cross the line!

64
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,510
Were you even listening to me?!

65
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,940
Like I care!

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,530
That's something you guys just made up!

67
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,270
Besides, prison will be an improvement
after having Caesar use me as a guinea pig.

68
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,990
And I don't have a crew anymore.

69
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,250
It felt really good to see you send Caesar flying.

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
Thanks a lot.

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,550
Heave, ho!

72
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,590
Alright, keep pulling.

73
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,090
You should have told me earlier
that we were gonna take this tanker.

74
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,720
I would've fought somewhere else if I knew I'd have to fix it.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,690
There we go!

76
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,970
What's the ruckus?

77
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,040
What's going on?

78
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,270
Luffy!

79
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,190
P-Please stop him!

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,350
H-H-He's a murderer!

81
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,550
Murderer?!

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,170
Who's a murderer?

83
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,320
It's Law!

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,890
Traf?

85
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,390
What's going on over there?

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,150
I killed someone too!

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,560
No, Kin'emon-san was already dead...

88
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,530
but I broke him!

89
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,510
Not only is he dead, now he's broken!

90
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,400
He's dead smashed!

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
W-W-What do we do now?!

92
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,280
Will he be alright if we glue him back together?!

93
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,910
As if that would work, you idiot!

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,060
Momonosuke!

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,720
Why are you still alive?!

96
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,920
Why did you do that, Sanji-san?!

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
He freaked me out!

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,790
You were the one shouting about him being dead
when he's perfectly fine!

99
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,640
Hey, take a look at that.

100
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,030
Someone who was
supposed to be killed by the gas is still alive.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,770
Isn't it great, Kin'emon-san?  I had thought...

102
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,200
Father!

103
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,580
Mo-Momonosuke?

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,130
Father!

105
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,400
Momonosuke!

106
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm so glad that you are alive!

107
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,920
F-Father!

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,180
Momonosuke?

109
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,040
Now that I think about it,
he did say that he was originally human.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,080
My son, you are stark naked.

111
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,540
Transform!

112
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,780
Child of the Wano Country (Son of Kin'emon) Momonosuke

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,780
{\an8}I would expect no less from a child of the Wano Country.

114
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,840
You look good in a kimono.

115
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,990
But father, how did you find...

116
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,260
Momonosuke!

117
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,630
Law!

118
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,590
Get out here, Law!

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,810
You...

120
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,080
Just what were you doing to the children?!

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
If anything has happened to them then I...

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,910
That's why I told you not to look.  I was just...

123
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,570
slicing up their bodies.

124
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,710
They've been fed narcotics.  Their recovery
will be long and hard, there's no way around that.

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,550
Oh, Raccoon Dog-chan!

126
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,820
Raccoon Dog-kun!

127
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,810
A-Are you all okay?

128
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,130
That guy with the fluffy head...

129
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,430
just took all the bad stuff out of our bodies.

130
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,130
Huh?

131
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,740
It was scary, but I feel much better now!

132
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,750
It was fun having our bodies in pieces.

133
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,490
Now I'm hungry.

134
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,610
I see.

135
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,580
But Mocha hasn't woken up yet.

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,980
Mocha was fighting to help us, right?

137
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,780
I didn't know that Master was such a bad guy.

138
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,420
It's a bit fuzzy, but I remember
Mocha coughing up blood and collapsing!

139
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,730
Hey, Raccoon Dog-kun.

140
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,040
Uh, I'm a reindeer.

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,830
Mocha's gonna be okay, isn't she?

142
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,460
We're gonna go home together, right Raccoon Dog-kun?

143
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,160
Of course.

144
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,230
You're getting out of this nightmare.

145
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,000
Where's the orange-haired lady?

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,570
She's the one that's going to take us home, right?

147
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,030
We want to thank her!

148
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,130
Let's save these children!

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
How am I supposed to turn my back...

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,220
On children who are crying for help?!

151
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,390
Hello.

152
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,160
From now on, the Navy will take care of you.

153
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,030
No way!

154
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,460
What about the robot?

155
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,730
What about the rubber-man?

156
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,120
What about the guy with the curly eyebrows?

157
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,740
That smells great!

158
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,710
I wonder what Sanji's making.

159
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,560
I can't wait.

160
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,010
Nami?

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
Have you worked things out with the Navy?

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Yeah.

163
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm going to leave everything to the Navy.

164
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,610
I may have told them that I'd save them...

165
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,290
but we're pirates
and that would probably make things difficult.

166
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,250
Yeah, we'd probably wind up
being blamed for their abductions.

167
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,630
It's best to leave them
with people on the justice side of the line.

168
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,590
You're right.

169
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,090
Also...

170
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,950
I am begging you...
Allow me to take care of the children!

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,280
I just have a weakness for the eyes of a female marine.

172
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,650
Female marines?

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,850
Yeah.

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,150
They're reassuring to me.

175
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh yeah, your mom was a marine, wasn't she?

176
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,820
It's always best to be saved by a strong, kind-hearted female marine.

177
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,250
I think so too.

178
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,460
I don't want to hear that from you.

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,530
Well, you're the one that said it!

180
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,110
Newkama Kenpo Secret Technique, 99th Vital Recipe!

181
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,500
Let's revive your cold and tired bodies!

182
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,070
Hormone Soup with Sea Pig!

183
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,210
If you haven't eaten for several days...

184
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,440
then take your time and savor the meal,
starting with the soup.

185
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,130
It looks so good!

186
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,360
You're really hungry, right?

187
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,590
Momo, Sanji's food is the best.

188
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,460
I have no need for it!

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,860
I am not hungry in the slightest!

190
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,670
Hey, wait you brat!

191
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,720
What are you gonna do with that dish?!

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,710
I won't forgive anyone that wastes food,
even if they're a kid!

193
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,110
I shall eat.

194
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,280
H-Hey.

195
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,160
Delicious!

196
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
What is this?

197
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,570
I feel stronger!

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,860
What delicious food!

199
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,520
Delicious.

200
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,710
Father...!

201
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,780
Let us accept their food.

202
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,480
The truth is that they saved my life.

203
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,340
You may trust these people.

204
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,960
You've had nothing to eat until now, right?

205
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,180
You have done well to endure.

206
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,630
It must have been hard.

207
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,800
It's alright now.

208
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,270
Let us believe that the others have endured as well.

209
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,910
Now, we shall continue to live, Momonosuke!

210
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,780
Yeah.

211
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,640
What happened?
Is it so delicious that it makes you cry?

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,650
No you idiot, they've clearly been through a lot.

213
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,260
Just what happened to these guys?

214
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,470
Hmm?

215
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,960
What happened to
the line between good and evil, you jerks?!

216
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,820
It's a truce, bro.

217
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,390
Okay then, why don't you guys
go get some booze from the tanker?

218
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,250
With pleasure.

219
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,220
Some juice as well!

220
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,050
Hey, Straw Hatter.

221
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,740
We need to leave this place quickly.

222
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,900
If we stay and eat, new enemies will arrive.

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,240
Really?

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,210
Tell everyone else.

225
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,480
Right, got it.

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
Let's party!

227
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,670
Cheers!

228
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,770
Father...

229
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,210
A warrior shouldn't let anyone see their tears.

230
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,280
What's that supposed to be, Luffy?

231
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,500
Cheers, bro.

232
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,820
Yeah!

233
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,300
Wait for it...

234
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,250
One, two, three!

235
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,410
Here you go.

236
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,430
Thank you.

237
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,670
Mocha!

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,520
Vice-Admiral Smokey!

239
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,040
We're gonna go back inside.

240
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,990
What's wrong?

241
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,220
We made Caesar spill the weakness of the poison gas.

242
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,150
Our comrades are still alive and we can still save them!

243
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,570
Why are you still alive, Smoker?

244
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,280
Law...

245
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,120
There's no way that you would believe
that I'd keep a promise to a pirate like you.

246
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,260
But if you really wanted to silence me,
then you had plenty of chances to kill me.

247
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,260
What are you planning on using Straw Hat to do?

248
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,010
Use?

249
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,950
Who's the one being used?

250
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,780
Which of the Four Emperors are you talking about? {copy paste from 594}

251
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,850
The target is... {end copy paste}

252
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,910
Kaidou of the Beasts.

253
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,910
As long as the first one isn't Shanks, I'm fine with it.

254
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,080
Because I plan on defeating all of them!

255
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,500
You want to defeat all of them?!

256
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,390
While that may coincide with our goals,
you're underestimating them too much.

257
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,120
They are the emperors of this sea,
and battled Whitebeard himself for their turf.

258
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,370
Among them, Kaidou of the Beasts
is known as the most powerful creature in the world.

259
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,910
What?!  He's not even human?

260
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,860
The purpose of our alliance is to take down Kaidou.

261
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,310
The probability of our plan succeeding is...

262
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, it's best to assume it's extremely low.

263
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
What, really?!

264
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
We shouldn't accept his offer, Luffy.

265
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,620
I see.

266
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,980
Alright, let's do it.

267
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,080
Hold on, now!

268
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,110
There was no real reason why I let you live, White Hunter.

269
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,010
By the way, I plan on heading to Green Bit.

270
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,900
I wonder if the Straw Hat Crew is too much for me to handle? {I'm a bit iffy with this translation. Starfish-kun?}{I can't think of anything better... Translation-wise it's accurate and I can't think of a better phrasing. -Starfish}

271
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,510
Rubber...

272
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,860
Gluttony!

273
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,130
You're amazing!

274
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,450
He stretches!

275
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,700
Cool!

276
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
We're G-5.
Even crying kids shut up when they see us!

277
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,400
I thought you guys were gonna use the tanker?

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,570
Nah, that isn't what we were doing.

279
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:43,490
Nami and Chopper said that they refuse to set sail
until they've made sure the kids are off safely.

280
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,560
And I can't be bothered to wait for
another Navy ship to come here,

281
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,030
so use that to take the kids.

282
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,880
Get on the ship, kids!

283
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,300
We're taking you home!

284
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,560
Hey, hey, Straw Hats!

285
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,990
If the tanker is ours then...

286
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,340
this is the new line!

287
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,800
Don't even think of crossing it.

288
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,110
This is the line between good and evil.

289
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,300
Understand?  Don't come any closer!

290
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,660
Again?

291
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,870
Weren't we just partying together?

292
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,300
Don't be an idiot!

293
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,640
In regards to that, we are really grateful for the food.

294
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,070
But, you guys are pirates!

295
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,500
A shame on all humanity!

296
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,010
Heave, ho!

297
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,970
What's this?

298
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,800
Big sis Nami? { def: i forget what they actually call her.  'nice lady'? }{Well we've been translating it as "Lady" before, but... "Lady Nami" gives a slightly different feel compared to what they're actually saying here, doesn't it? So I'm just gonna let this slide. -Starfish}

299
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,570
Chopper-chan?

300
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,680
Where's the robot?

301
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,740
Huh?  Where'd all the pirate guys go?

302
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,750
Get out of the way, you guys.  You're being annoying.

303
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a barrier!

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't look at the pirates!

305
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,580
You guys are pretty much pirates yourselves, G-5.

306
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,290
But, it looks like they're all safely on board.

307
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,260
We are justice!

308
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,810
We kill all pirates who endanger civilians!

309
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,370
Pirates are the scum of the world!

310
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,540
We are justice!

311
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,590
Don't let the kids lay eyes on them!

312
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,330
Run, you guys! {copy paste from 610}

313
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,610
If you don't want to die then start running!{end copy paste}

314
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,750
They said that Vegapunk is gonna help them
with the candy problem.

315
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,800
Really?!

316
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,790
That's reassuring.

317
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,920
Swirly guy!{Doing a quick search it seems this was what we translated this as earlier. -Starfish}

318
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,510
You're in the way, Navy!

319
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,390
Please move!

320
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,070
Any of you who want to say goodbye to a pirate is a bad kid!

321
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,070
Anyone who says thanks will be
thrown off the boat and left on the island!

322
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,870
Listen up!

323
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,570
Pirates are evil and the Navy is good!

324
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,070
Pirates are unforgivable!

325
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,750
We stand against all pirates!

326
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,320
But they said they would save us...

327
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,550
and they did!

328
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,320
Even though they knew nothing about us...{I might be wrong, but I don't think this qualifies as a complete sentence. -Starfish}

329
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,180
We're so big and would only get in their way, but they took us with them anyway!

330
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,620
I want to go home.

331
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,160
We'll go back soon.

332
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,100
Just a bit longer.

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Even though this is an deserted island
that no one ever comes to...{I might be wrong, but I don't think this qualifies as a complete sentence. -Starfish}

334
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,940
They came for us!

335
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,880
I'm sorry! {copy paste from 614}

336
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm so sorry... that we didn't find you sooner! {end copy paste}

337
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,150
Pirates are dirty and rotten!

338
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,530
But the Navy...

339
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,690
If you won't even let us say thank you
when we leave...

340
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,330
then the Navy can just...

341
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,300
Wait!  I'm sorry!

342
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,110
Say no to pirates!

343
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,500
Say yes to the Navy!

344
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,520
And even more than that!
The Navy is righteous and brave and-

345
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,790
Stop this at once!

346
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,040
How disgraceful!

347
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,360
B-But Tashigi-chan, if we don't keep insulting them...

348
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,850
We'll end up...{I feel that since the "like"-part is the keyword here, and also the one part he's clearly having trouble getting out of his mouth, it really should not be in the first part of this line. -Starfish}

349
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,750
actually liking these outlaws! { def: fade out? }

350
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,910
E-Even though they're pirates!

351
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,370
What weird marines!

352
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,150
Hey everyone!

353
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,160
Thanks for saving us!

354
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,570
When we grow up we're definitely...

355
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,490
gonna become pirates!

356
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,740
No you won't!

357
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,950
Well then, let's get going.

358
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,160
Hey, is that guy coming with us?

359
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh yeah, we haven't told you about the alliance.

360
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,420
Straw Hat, prepare yourself!

361
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,460
Next time we meet, we'll be enemies!

362
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,270
See you later!

363
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,440
We'll definitely catch you!

364
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,890
You brats seem to have the devil's luck.

365
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,490
To think that the sky path would end here. {I know this doesn't make sense, it's not supposed to. But using forseight into how Doflamingo travels I think it fits.}{ manga: To think that the "sky path" would be cut off }{The quoted manga-translation is accurate... I just don't like how it's phrased there, so I tried modifying it a bit. Though I'm not really happy with my own modification either... But I think that's what he's getting at, that he didn't really have a backup plan for how to get to Punk Hazard if his "sky-path" wouldn't take him all the way. -Starfish}

366
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,770
Young master!

367
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,180
Damn it!

368
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,370
That bastard Law really did betray us!

369
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,240
I'm sorry -dasuyan.

370
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
I wanna apologize with my death.

371
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,510
I was needed and I couldn't help!

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,210
Isn't this the life boat from our tanker?

373
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,970
I'm so ashamed -dasuyan.

374
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,940
We did everything we could.

375
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,680
It's alright.  No need to say anything.

376
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,820
You were just following my orders.

377
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,090
Now this is surprising.

378
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,200
I didn't think that the boss would come out himself.

379
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,980
Is that you, Law?  Long time, no see.

380
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,470
Couldn't you have stayed so we could meet in person?

381
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,790
If you're searching for Caesar, then he's with me.

382
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,080
J-Joker, please save me!

383
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Where are Baby 5 and Buffalo's bodies?

384
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,720
Who knows.

385
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,190
That isn't what we're talking about.

386
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,920
Let's make a deal.

387
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,820
Hey Law, don't try to be so tough.

388
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,030
A brat shouldn't try to act like an adult.

389
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,770
Where are you right now?

390
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,540
You shouldn't anger me. { def: upset }

391
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,160
Anger?

392
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,650
Your most important trading partner is...

393
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,320
one of the Four Emperors.
The great pirate, Kaidou of the Beasts.

394
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,590
You're the one who shouldn't anger him.

395
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,880
What do you think would happen
if he found out you couldn't make Smiles anymore.

396
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,390
He isn't a man you can negotiate with.

397
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,550
There would be a brutal battle.

398
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,060
Young master, your face...

399
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,270
You would be killed. { def: utterly annihilated }

400
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,900
You're taking this joke too far, Law.

401
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,150
What do I have to do for you to give back Caesar?

402
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,910
What are your demands?

403
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,790
Give up your position as a Warlord.

404
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,000
What an insolent brat!

405
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,570
Then we won't be able to stay on Dressrosa!

406
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,730
Throw away everything you've gained these
past ten years and return to being a normal pirate.

407
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,110
Of course, if you do that
then the Admirals from Navy HQ will hunt you down.

408
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,780
You have until tomorrow's morning news.

409
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:27,720
If I see that you've retired from the Warlords then I will contact you again.

410
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,620
If there is nothing, then all negotiations are off.

411
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,130
Later.

412
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
Hey wait, Law!

413
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,930
Young Master!
