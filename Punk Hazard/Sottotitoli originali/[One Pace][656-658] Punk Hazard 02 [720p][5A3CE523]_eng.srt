1
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,330
Who goes there?

2
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,910
Hey!

3
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,710
This thing just talked!

4
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,760
D-D-Don't be ridiculous!  You must have imagined it!

5
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
Really?

6
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,100
It's hard enough to believe
that this is actually a dragon!

7
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,520
Is it really a dragon?

8
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,690
Yes, as hard as it is to believe.

9
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,900
A lizard's body with giant wings...

10
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,780
No matter how you look at it,
it's exactly what the legends describe!

11
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,500
Don't tell me...

12
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,840
I-I-I-

13
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,810
It breathed fire!

14
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,230
How could a creature like this possibly exist?!

15
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,600
Am I dreaming?!

16
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
How interesting!

17
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,080
It wasn't effective?!

18
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,630
He sure is tough!

19
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,010
Behind you!

20
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,060
Luffy!

21
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,530
It's looking right at us!

22
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,240
Bring it on!

23
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,990
It can hear you!

24
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,960
I can sense your presence!

25
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,960
So it's true.  The dragon definitely just said something!

26
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,230
{\an8}Ultimate Tiger Hunt

27
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,210
Damn it!  How can it be so strong and tough?!

28
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,970
Bastard!

29
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,400
Luffy!

30
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah?

31
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,070
He spoke.

32
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,650
Told you so!

33
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,240
I heard it too!  Why?!

34
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,170
It's flying!

35
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
Pffft!  Are you companions of that Warlord?!

36
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,150
Hot!

37
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,330
It's so hot... and that dragon just spoke again!

38
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,540
He said "Warlord", right?

39
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,250
Does he have some grudge against the Seven Warlords?

40
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,050
Luffy.

41
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,100
Leave him to me.

42
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,310
This time, I will cut him in half!

43
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,760
Right, I got it!

44
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,200
In that case...

45
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,280
Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

46
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,780
I'll knock him down to the ground!

47
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,280
Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

48
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,590
Even his body is hot!

49
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,900
Poooh- I must say, this is pleasantly cool!

50
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,860
Poooh- The flames are quite refreshing -pooh!

51
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,660
Ah... Stop that...

52
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,870
That tickles, it does!

53
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,000
Cease this!

54
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,420
I command you to cease this, I do -poooh!

55
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,920
I knew it!

56
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,130
Hey!  This is incredible!

57
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,170
There's a human sticking out of the dragon's back!

58
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,890
Huuuh?!  What's going on?!

59
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,310
So the one speaking earlier was...

60
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,020
You bastard!

61
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,530
Eat wings, why don't you!

62
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,830
Dumbass!

63
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,680
Zoro!  He's falling to you!

64
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,320
Usopp!

65
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,400
Alright!

66
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,860
{\an8}Sure-Kill Green Star

67
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,330
{\an8}One-Sword Style

68
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,010
{\an8}Draw-and-Resheathe Technique

69
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,390
{\an8}Death Lion Song

70
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,920
Incredible!

71
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,420
This dragon looks delicious!

72
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,840
We can barbecue it on the island's flames!

73
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
Great idea!

74
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,610
Nami-swan!

75
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,700
This time, I thought I'd make us a cold shellfish crÃªpe!

76
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Along with some champagne!

77
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,210
Huh?  Are you sleeping?

78
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,050
Mist?

79
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,770
No...

80
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,020
Damn it!  I've already inhaled a lot of it!

81
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,770
They've all been knocked out by the gas!

82
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,650
Is this a natural gas unique to the New World?

83
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,610
Or has someone boarded the ship?

84
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,490
I hope those four on the island...

85
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,620
have a Baby Snail Phone with them.

86
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,470
I have to... tell them...

87
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,790
Two humans.

88
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,960
One iron man.

89
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,380
And one pet.

90
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,300
Tie them all up!

91
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Yes, Sir!

92
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,890
Pirates are ideal for our purposes.

93
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,890
Even if they go missing, nobody will care.

94
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,880
Let's take them straight to the Master.

95
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,800
Punk Hazard Island

96
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,500
The Burning Lands

97
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,430
Let's pull him out!

98
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,060
I say, who are you?!  Unhand me, now -pooh!

99
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,980
Hey!  I'm gonna get you out of there!

100
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,380
Hold still!

101
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,520
Heave, ho!

102
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,860
I tore him in half!  Sorry!

103
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,780
Idiot, you think apologizing will fix this?!
You've killed him!

104
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,290
Pooh- Am I free now?

105
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,930
The legs are speaking!  What's going on?!

106
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,550
Zombie!  Monster!

107
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,890
Hang on.

108
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,960
What could this mean?
There's no sign of his body being torn off.

109
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,560
What's up with that?

110
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,730
So... does that mean he was just a pair of legs all along?

111
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,440
What a weirdo!

112
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,110
He's pretty tall.

113
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,950
Who goes there?  What are you doing?

114
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,580
I sense your presence,
but I have neither eyes nor ears.

115
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,040
You sure are unique!

116
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,340
Poooh- Though I know not who you are,
you will let me pass!

117
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,380
What?

118
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,630
I will not die here!

119
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,470
He's running away!

120
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,380
You shall not get away with this!  Foolish Warlord!

121
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,980
Hey, wait!  Join my-

122
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,410
Cut it out, Luffy!

123
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,990
And... that's how it happened?

124
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,150
Yeah, that's right!

125
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,330
This dragon meat is delicious!

126
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,490
What are these things called, Usopp?

127
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,370
Huh?

128
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,830
I guess...

129
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,100
a centaur, right?

130
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm a centaur!

131
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,300
This is awesome!

132
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,350
First he was stuck to the dragon, and now to Luffy?

133
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,470
What's up with this guy?!

134
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,810
You give up?

135
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,230
Damn!
I have been attached to something again -pooh!

136
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,940
Grrr... I could just... Let me go -pooh!

137
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,610
That isn't very polite, Luffy.

138
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,320
Really?

139
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,240
What now?

140
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,870
See?  Of course he won't just become part of you!

141
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,040
Nobody would be that obedient!

142
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,540
His upper half must be in trouble somewhere!

143
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,790
Give those legs back to their owner!

144
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,590
Don't you have any imagination, Usopp?

145
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,340
This is just the way he is.  See?

146
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,270
I see, so he's supposed to be a Legman?

147
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,760
Yeah right!  Like hell I can just accept that!

148
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,510
What's your name?

149
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,860
And about this dragon meat...

150
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,020
You're gonna eat most of it anyway,
so you carry it!

151
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,900
Hey, you guys!  Come over here!

152
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,820
Oh, Zoro!  Did you find them?

153
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,660
The samurai and the guy who got killed?

154
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,830
Look.

155
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,090
Huh?  What is it?

156
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,420
A-A snow covered mountain?!

157
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,370
No... a whole mountain of ice?!

158
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,890
The other half of the island, across the lake,
has snow covered mountains!

159
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,430
Yet this side is scorching hot
and covered with active volcanoes!

160
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,560
What's up with this island?!

161
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,770
This solves one mystery.

162
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,230
Mystery?

163
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,730
Oh, right!

164
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,610
The voice on the Snail Phone said it was cold!

165
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,140
Please, help me! {Copy-paste from 579}

166
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,950
What's wrong?!

167
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,990
It's freezing... Is that you, boss?

168
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,160
My companions keep getting cut down.

169
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,710
The samurai's gonna kill us all! {End copy-paste from 579}

170
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:10,460
So the killer samurai and his victims are over there.

171
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,820
This island is so interesting!
It's snowing on that mountain, right?!

172
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,720
And it's so hot here... I wanna eat a snow cone!

173
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,430
Idiot, you're actually going there?!

174
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,060
It'll be way too cold!

175
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,560
Besides, it's too far away!
Let's head back to the ship now.

176
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,200
How troubling.  It looks rather cold.

177
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,360
If there are beasts there, we can take their fur coats.

178
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,860
We'll manage somehow.

179
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,500
No we won't!  Why are you guys set on going?!

180
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,990
Snow cones!

181
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,910
H-Hey, wait, Luffy!

182
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,680
Ow... What are you-

183
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,930
I saw it!  I saw it!  I saw it!

184
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,860
A bird!  No, a person!  Huh?!

185
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,690
It was a person yet a bird!

186
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,520
A bird?  A person?  Which was it?!

187
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,480
Huh?  What're you talking about?

188
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,650
A bird?  A person?  Which was it?!

189
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,770
Huh?!  Was it a bird or a person?!  Zoro?

190
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,770
There's nobody there.

191
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,710
Sanji, what're you so worked up about?

192
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,540
Oh, you're awake?

193
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,610
Take a look around, and you'll understand.

194
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,780
This is terrible, Franky!  We've been locked up!

195
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,540
Hey!  What is this place?!

196
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,210
Where are we?!

197
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,800
I was on deck eating that giant shellfish dessert,
and then... I can't remember!

198
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,890
This is just a guess,
but it seems likely that someone used sleeping gas...

199
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,730
and captured us while we were unconscious!

200
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,950
What?!

201
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,240
The ship was gassed, there's no doubt about that.

202
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,530
I'm so sorry.  If only I'd noticed it sooner...

203
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,430
This is not good.

204
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,550
Are we gonna be sold off?
Are they human traffickers?

205
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,300
But if they got everyone who was on the ship,
where is Brook?

206
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,020
I don't know.  We are the only ones here.

207
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,660
They're human traffickers,
so they wouldn't bother with a skeleton, right?

208
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,950
You can't really be called a human either, you know.

209
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,330
Neither can you!

210
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,880
Whatever!

211
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,030
You there.

212
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,000
Did someone just... say something?

213
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,290
No, it wasn't any of us.

214
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,590
You there, do you enjoy a challenge?

215
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,250
In particular, a puzzle!

216
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,630
Did this thing just speak?

217
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,850
What is this?

218
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,150
This thing?  How insolent!

219
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,320
What's this?

220
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
Huh?  An insect?

221
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,840
Is it some new kind of Snail Phone?

222
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,030
There are eight of them!  I didn't notice!

223
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,450
I am no pathetic insect!

224
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,780
You do not seem like bad folk...

225
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,080
These are all bits of my face.

226
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,790
Forgive me,
but could you put them back together for me?

227
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,630
Face?  Now that you mention it...

228
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,650
This is a mouth, and this is an eye.

229
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,800
Like this?

230
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,720
How's that?!

231
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,560
It's true!  It became a face!

232
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,020
No, there are quite a few parts left over!

233
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,190
Isn't it like this?

234
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,820
Well?

235
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,650
Completely wrong!

236
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,740
No no no... This should work.

237
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,870
We're making progress!

238
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,790
Wrong!  Wrong!

239
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,510
I wanna try!

240
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,210
You...

241
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,050
Don't play around with other people's faces!

242
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,380
It's done!

243
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
It's become a proper face!

244
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,010
I feel some slight discomfort in my jaw and forehead...

245
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,830
but, very well.

246
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,680
I thank you!

247
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,880
A detached head is talking!

248
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,640
Now you notice?!

249
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,850
How can you be alive?!  Are you an evil spirit?!

250
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,150
I do not understand either.

251
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,560
I was not reduced to a head by choice.

252
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,990
That fellow used some queer technique.

253
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,490
I thought I would die upon being cut to pieces,
yet I found myself in this state.

254
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,070
To be cut up by the enemy and yet remain alive...

255
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,350
is a disgrace to a warrior!

256
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,560
One.  Two.

257
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,850
Three.

258
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,850
And four.

259
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,190
Hello?  Did you find them?

260
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,860
Yeah, I did.  I'm about to take them out.

261
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,030
Four intruders.

262
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,660
I see.

263
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,870
How exciting.

264
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,380
Be careful, now.

265
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,630
Roger that.

266
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,810
You were cut down by the enemy,

267
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,350
and you're still alive, even as just a head?

268
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,480
How?!  I don't get it!

269
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,240
He's like Buggy!  How strange.

270
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,910
I wish I could slice open my belly and let my body decay,

271
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,360
but there are things I must do,
even if my greatest failure must be known!

272
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,540
By the way, you... Do you know where we are?

273
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,890
"You"?!

274
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,390
How dare a female address me, a warrior, in such an informal manner?!

275
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,690
Women shall walk three steps behind men and address them with a modest grace! {Gil : Nami says 'Huh?' or something after this line. Maybe add this in?}

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,510
What was that, you bastard?

277
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,710
You've got some nerve, for a severed head!

278
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,320
You're talking to the ones who put your head back together!

279
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,070
C-Cease this violence!

280
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,120
You're still talking?!

281
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,660
Cease this, woman! {Gil : Originally 'Lass'. Makes me think of a scottish accent more than something a samurai would say. Maybe something like 'Girl' or just 'Woman' would be better. Alternatively, if we want to make him sound old-fashioned a bit more we could use 'Wench' or something... }

282
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,460
What kind of country do women like this come from?

283
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,960
So rude and self-centered...

284
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,800
However,

285
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,630
you must be deeply grieved 
to have been robbed down to your underwear.

286
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,090
I offer my sympathy.

287
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,030
I haven't been stripped!

288
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,510
What?!

289
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,720
This is just fashion!

290
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,310
How lewd!  That is nothing but a breast-band, is it not?! {lol this piano music...suddenly this is a saloon! -Fadeout4}

291
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,760
What, you don't like it?

292
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
I daresay I do.

293
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,860
Why, you...

294
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,150
Those lecherous eyes!

295
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,160
It is a trap, it is!

296
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,930
I think his skull's been cracked!  Doesn't it hurt?

297
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,680
It hurts... It hur... It hurts not!

298
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,550
It is... merely itchy!

299
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,140
I see, so women from other countries wear only breast-bands?

300
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,010
In that case, I quite like it.

301
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,280
Incidentally, who are you people?

302
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,570
I heard that you were dragged here from your ship.

303
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,490
We're pirates.

304
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,860
Pirates?!

305
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,070
You people are pirates?!

306
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,120
That explains your savagery!

307
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,670
I loathe pirates.  They make me vomit!

308
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,560
I thought that perhaps it was fate that brought us to this island of ice at the same time,

309
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,840
and that maybe we could escape together.

310
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,520
But regrettably, since you are pirates,

311
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,290
Hey, wait a second.
What do you mean "island of ice"? {should we add an "oy, oy" to the beginning of this? -Fadeout4} {Gil : I'd rather not. It sounds okay when spoken but is kind of retarded to write.}

312
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,990
This is a burning island, isn't it?

313
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,300
Yeah, that's right!  It's a scorching hot island where even the ocean is on fire!

314
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,240
No, wait.

315
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,790
You...

316
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,130
say that this is an island of ice, right?

317
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,080
Haven't you heard the volcanic eruptions?

318
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,370
I have heard the sound of explosions from time to time,

319
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,590
but I came to this island via a sea of ice floes.{tlc suggested "but I came to this island of ice via a sea of ice floes.", but I'd have shortened it anyway as redundant. -kae}

320
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,600
Cease talking to me, you abominable pirates!

321
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,740
So the winter sky I saw from the ship...

322
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,390
was real after all.

323
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,860
The burning island Luffy and the others went to is an arctic island from the other side. {3 line madness!! Also, not sure if this line and the next should be "Main" or "Thoughts" style}

324
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,480
Basically, we've been taken to the arctic side!

325
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,080
Though if we want to know who brought us here, and why,

326
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,200
we'll have to get out of this room and see for ourselves.

327
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,360
But Nami-san, the door is solid.  
It doesn't look like we'll be able to...

328
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,630
Out of my way!

329
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,630
I've got a full tank of cola!

330
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,470
Hey!  Hey, hey, wait a second!

331
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,110
It's open.  Let's get out.

332
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,700
I see that weird body isn't just for show.

333
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,460
I wanna shoot beams too!

334
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,100
So what are you gonna do?

335
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,610
You'd want to escape with us if we weren't pirates, right?

336
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,940
Silence!  Be on your way, pirate!

337
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,160
There's no way for you to escape alone without a body.

338
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,570
What are you doing?!

339
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,330
Am I right, samurai of the Wano Kingdom?!

340
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,370
He's a samurai?!

341
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,130
This topknot is a hairstyle unique to the Wano Kingdom. {And how the hell would Sanji know this? -Fadeout4}

342
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,760
Does that mean that the murderous samurai they mentioned on the Snail-Phone was him?!

343
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Scary!

344
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,810
I heard a blast from over here!

345
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,640
Hurry!

346
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,730
Could it be the pirates we captured?

347
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,060
Sanji-kun, hurry!  They're coming for us!

348
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:44,820
We came here after receiving an emergency signal from someone you attacked, samurai! {3 line madness PART 2!! -Fadeout4}

349
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,720
Sanji, let's hurry!

350
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,620
Just leave that scary samurai behind!

351
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,620
I would never bring dishonor upon myself by committing murder!

352
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,300
I came to this island to rescue my son!

353
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,010
I will kill all who get in my way!

354
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,120
There they are!

355
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,600
Fire!  Don't let them get away!

356
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,990
Stop right there!  I'll take you on!

357
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,410
How did they get out?!

358
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,910
Contact Master immediately!

359
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,170
Who are they?! {Gil : Nami's face looks like a plastic mask}

360
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,090
Sanji-kun! {Gil : And now an ugly plastic mask}

361
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,740
You brought him with you?!

362
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,170
He's dangerous!

363
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,430
You can blame me if anything happens!

364
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
There's a door!

365
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,650
Who are you?

366
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,640
What?!

367
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,990
Gigantic... children?

368
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,440
C-Children?!

369
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,620
What's going on here?!

370
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,960
Who are these kids?

371
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,940
Perhaps this is some sort of nursery?

372
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,670
They're absolutely huge.  Are they giants?

373
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,330
Did we drop anchor at an island of giants?

374
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,600
But there are some smaller kids too...

375
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,970
Then, maybe this facility
doesn't discriminate between races?

376
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,230
I don't see any adults, though.

377
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,050
Hey, who are you?

378
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,070
I don't know them...

379
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,240
Ah, could you be the frozen people?

380
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,150
Did you make it out?!

381
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,400
Frozen?

382
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,820
What's she talking about?

383
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,740
You're a robot!

384
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,860
W-What?!

385
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,160
It's a robot!

386
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,670
So cool!

387
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,430
I love robots!

388
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,590
They're the best!

389
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,130
What do you mean, best?

390
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,840
Sanji-kun?!

391
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,130
Robot!  Robot!  Robot!

392
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,890
Oh my, you...

393
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,980
like armored me that much?!

394
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,560
Hey, what did she mean by frozen people?

395
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,070
Oh, look!  It's a stuffed animal!

396
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,520
What?

397
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,490
A stuffed raccoon dog!

398
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm a reindeer!

399
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,400
How cute!

400
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,280
Help me!

401
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,780
I want one!

402
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,790
Franky is ridiculously popular with these kids!

403
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,960
Swirly eyebrows!

404
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
Shut up, you damn brat!

405
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,790
You're right!

406
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,790
I say, all of you!

407
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,580
Do any of you know of a child named Momonosuke?!

408
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,590
He is a young man, he is!

409
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,760
Scary!

410
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,800
The head spoke!

411
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,760
Run!

412
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,600
Hey, you guys!  Can you tell us-

413
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,470
Wait!

414
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,230
Shut up, idiot!  We can't ask them anything!

415
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,070
You're just scaring them whenever you speak!

416
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,990
The door to Biscuits Room is open!

417
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,540
Here they come!

418
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,790
Anyway, let's just get to the far side of the room!

419
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,080
It must be the pirates from before.

420
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,540
Don't let them escape!

421
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,680
What kind of facility is this?!

422
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Please tell me!

423
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,170
I seek a child named Momonosuke!

424
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,850
Just stop talking!

425
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,100
A woman raised her hand against me!

426
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,640
This is a shame for a warrior, it is!

427
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,980
I want to slice open my belly!

428
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,150
Go ahead!  You're getting on my nerves,
you chauvinist pig!

429
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,320
Damn escapees!

430
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
You're not getting out of here!

431
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,110
Wait!

432
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,660
Calm down.  Guns and explosives are forbidden here.

433
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,620
We can't use anything stronger than gas bullets.

434
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,420
If we hit the children, we'll answer to the Master!

435
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,130
Alright, children, out of the way.

436
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,210
Out of the way!

437
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,670
That's dangerous!

438
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,810
Hey, Robot-san.
You aren't fom this island, are you?

439
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,140
Of course not.  But, boy... I am a cybor-

440
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,390
Do you have a ship?

441
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,990
Of course we do!  Our Sunny is the world's-

442
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,190
Save us!

443
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,530
What does he mean?

444
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,480
Please, save us!

445
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,790
What do you mean, save you?

446
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,740
This isn't a nursery?!

447
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,970
We're not sick any more!

448
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,580
We're all fine!

449
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,040
Sick?  With what disease?

450
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,600
Those damn brats!

451
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,690
Please, wait!

452
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,810
Let us out of here!

453
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,190
Please, Lady!  Help us!

454
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,480
Now, wait up, children!

455
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,950
Sorry... we're being chased, so...

456
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,470
What's going on?!

457
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,130
Hey, let's take them with us!

458
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,710
Idiot!  We don't even know where to go ourselves!

459
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,470
What good would come
from bringing all those kids along?!

460
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,070
But why...

461
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,770
am I feeling so sad?!

462
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,070
In that case...

463
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,000
come save us later!

464
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,510
I know, even though
I haven't gone outside the building!

465
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,840
This island is empty, right?!

466
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,800
There's no town here and no people!

467
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,310
That's why nobody has come to help us!

468
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,510
I wanna see Mommy and Daddy!

469
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,550
Lady!  Please come back!

470
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,180
Come back to save us!

471
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,980
Let's help these children!

472
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,580
What are you saying, Nami-san?!  There's no reason to do that!

473
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,530
They even said they were sick!  This might be a hospital!

474
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,160
We only just met them, 
and we don't know what's going on here!

475
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,380
It's not like we're a charity that rescues children!

476
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,680
Do you think I don't know that?

477
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,110
But when children are crying for me to save them...

478
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,630
how can I turn my back on them?!

479
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,800
Lady!

480
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,860
Quickly, they're getting away!

481
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,440
Those kids are in the way!

482
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,360
Who cares?!  Kill them aswell!

483
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,610
But Master will...

484
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,360
It's still better than letting them get away!

485
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,410
Sanji-kun! {OMG SANJI HAS TURNED INTO A SUPER-SAIYAN!!!}

486
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,950
Swirly bro!

487
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,170
Awesome!

488
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,940
That man...

489
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,040
is incredibly skilled!

490
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,890
Damn it!

491
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,970
Raccoon Dog-chan!

492
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,490
A rocket punch!

493
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,910
T-They're...

494
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,920
not running away anymore!

495
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,510
When Nami-san is kind... (only ever to children)...

496
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,430
When Nami-san is kind... (only ever to children)...

497
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,380
she is truly wonderful!

498
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,230
I'm falling for her all over again!

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,350
Chopper.  You go on ahead with Nami-san.

500
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,170
Sure, leave it to me!

501
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,240
Hey, kids!  Follow the beautiful lady and the Kung Fu raccoon dog!

502
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,500
I'll hold back the pursuers!

503
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,550
But don't get the wrong idea!

504
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,820
I'm only responding
to the longing in Nami-san's heart to save you.

505
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,340
If anything,
I hate you for stealing Nami-san's affection!

506
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,050
Thanks, swirly bro!

507
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,060
Shut it, you damn brat!

508
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,270
Now, bring it!

509
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,360
I see.  This door can absorb any impact, and yet...

510
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,110
Master!

511
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,160
...there are burn-marks.

512
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,790
Just who are those people?

513
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,790
I thought he was the only one with the technology to make lasers.

514
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,920
This reminds me of that despicable Vegapunk's Pacifista!

515
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,350
You still haven't captured the escapees?

516
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,180
They should have them cornered in the Biscuit Room by now.

517
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,310
The Biscuit Room?

518
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,940
Master, are you there?!

519
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,270
Yes, I am here.

520
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,270
A warship from G-5 is approaching the Northwest side of the island!

521
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,490
A warship?!  Drive it off at any cost!

522
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,530
Release a large volume of poison gas!

523
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,920
Just don't kill them.  If you do, the Government might figure out what we're up to.

524
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,790
Roger!

525
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,130
What?!  Nami and the others are gone?!

526
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,130
Punk Hazard Island, The Burning Lands

527
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,210
You mean you're alone?!

528
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,510
And when you woke up, there was snow and ice all around you?

529
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,350
Indeed!

530
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,390
I was so surprised!  I felt like a bone in a thunderstorm! {The phrase he uses is literally "like my bones were hit by a pigeon-bullet". I looked it up, and it appears to be a play on the Japanese proverb é³©ãè±éç ²ãé£ã£ããã, (literally "Like a pigeon being shot by a bean-bullet") which is apparently an expression of being extremely surprised, and it says that the English equivalent of this term is "Like a duck in a thunderstorm".} {Gil: Oh god...}

531
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,600
Huh?

532
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,400
No wait, like thunder in a duckstorm...

533
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,280
No, a duck in a bonestorm? {Gil : This is horrible...}

534
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,360
Well, whatever!

535
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,200
Ah, pardon me!

536
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,950
Were they trying to steal the cargo on the Sunny?  Who were they?

537
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,910
Well, I really don't...

538
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,970
By the way,

539
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,970
who are you fellows?

540
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,170
I took them out before I got a chance to ask.

541
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,300
They all appear to be wearing some kind of gas masks.

542
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,230
Gas masks?  Perhaps they used some sort of sleeping gas?

543
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,320
And then those people took the Sunny to the opposite side of the island.

544
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440
Dammit, I lost!

545
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,990
You sure are fast!

546
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,440
You did quite well yourself!

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,080
Alright, let's go again!

548
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,460
No matter how many times you try-

549
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,080
Hello?

550
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,920
What are you goofing around for?

551
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,930
Well, I just can't find them.

552
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,050
Are there really intruders here?

553
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,850
All I've found are a funny guy with talking hind-legs and his group.

554
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,720
He is the intruder!

555
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,680
Come on!  Let's keep going!

556
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,050
Where are Nami-san and the others?

557
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:16,360
Since they didn't leave behind a message, 
it seems likely they were taken somewhere.

558
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,450
I get it!  Since you're a skeleton,
they must have assumed you were just a corpse!

559
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,410
I see, so that's why I was left behind!  Such luck!

560
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,870
The enemy thinks they've captured all of us.
Are there any buildings or traces of people nearby?

561
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, Robin-san, your reasoning is so sharp.  It's like you can see everything!

562
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,980
There is...

563
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,260
a building.

564
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,270
A truly massive one!

565
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,470
It doesn't look like a restaurant.

566
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,560
Brook, we're hurrying over there, so wait for us.

567
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,620
Robin-san?

568
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,150
When you get here, may I see your-

569
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,570
Is our enemy someone from the Government?

570
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,160
Who knows?  Let's hope they're at least human.

571
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,020
I mean, so far we've seen...

572
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,370
a fire-breathing dragon,

573
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,460
a half-man,

574
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,000
and a bird-lady!

575
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,800
And then there's that centaur Luffy just befr-

576
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Now listen here!

577
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,300
What?!  What's gotten into you?!

578
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,670
You...

579
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,850
I let my guard down.  I thought you were on my side.

580
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,610
Why can't I be?
We're already friends, so don't attack me!

581
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,490
Die, intruder!

582
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,790
There's another one!

583
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,790
{\an8}Bellflower

584
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,990
A leopard and a giraffe, huh? {Gil: What is this? Enies Lobby?}

585
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,850
Looks like there are all kinds of centaurs.  How fun!

586
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,310
They're fictional horses!
Their very existence is bizarre!

587
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,070
Look at this Baby Snail-Phone!  It's got "CC" written on it!

588
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,830
They're not wild centaurs.

589
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,910
It must be some sort of organization!

590
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,560
In any case, even if we do return to the fiery ocean, the Sunny won't be there.

591
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,170
We've got no choice but to head for the arctic lands.

592
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,540
Nami, Sanji, Franky and Chopper have all gone missing!

593
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,680
They've most likely been kidnapped.

594
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,060
I just hope they haven't been shot full of holes by a rifle.

595
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,090
Cut that out!

596
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,600
It'd have been faster if we just dropped anchor on the other side of the island!

597
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,440
But then we wouldn't have been able to eat that dragon meat or meet Legson!

598
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,780
And who is Legson?

599
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,650
Oh, that's my back legs' name!

600
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,940
Alright, let's go!  We're changing our objective!

601
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,910
Head for the frozen lands to rescue our crewmates!

602
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,380
I wonder if anyone will be selling winter clothing along the way.

603
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,420
If we go there dressed like this, we'll seriously die.

604
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,210
What do we do?

605
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,380
Vice-admiral Smoker!  We can't!

606
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,340
The Northwestern Shore

607
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,550
I-I can't breathe!

608
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,340
Gas is still leaking out!

609
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:30,350
Ever since that damn Vegapunk's weapon experiments failed four years ago...

610
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,850
the whole island's gone rotten!

611
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,370
More importantly, I can't see Straw Hat Luffy's pirate ship anywhere!

612
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:42,860
There's no way anyone would come ashore with this much poisonous gas around.

613
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,570
That's not it.

614
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,760
It's unnatural for there to be this much gas.

615
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,700
What do you mean?

616
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,180
Two years ago, this was just a deserted island, with no fire or ice on it.

617
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,030
Surprisingly enough, most of the toxic materials had dissipated by then.

618
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,850
That's why Akainu and Aokiji...

619
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,800
chose Punk Hazard...

620
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,550
as the site of their duel.

621
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,410
A battle fierce enough to alter the climate!
