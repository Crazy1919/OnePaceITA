Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,320
So many obstacles are already behind us!

00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,730
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,690

Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

Now let's keep moving forward!

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,330
Always look up!

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,550
Keep your head held high!

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,000
Always step up!

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,850
Fly over the waves!

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,450
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,690
Now let's head for the future!

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,090
We drift forward, riding the waves,

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,350
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
all under this flag...

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,710
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,220
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,890
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,820
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,720
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,390
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,690
So many obstacles are already behind us!

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,860
Now let's keep moving forward!

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,240
Always look up!

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,550
Keep your head held high!

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,940
Always step up!

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,010
Now let's head for the future!

{\an5}The Dragon Named Momonosuke and
the Menacing Snow Fruit User!

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,440
{\an8}Momonosuke?

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,440
Building C - Underground Garbage Dump

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,550
{\an8}That would be my name.

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,090
I've heard that name before...

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,550
Where did I hear it?

47
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,880
As if I'd know.
You have probably mistaken me for another person.

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,100
More importantly, do you...

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,060
Stop drooling!

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,210
I am not food.

51
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,880
I would rather eat you than be eaten by you.

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,010
{\an8}Restrain yourself!

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,520
Momonosuke (Dragon)

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,920
Huh? Momonosuke must be stuck here somewhere, talking with his farts!

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,020
Hey, where are you!

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,160
W-What do you think you're doing?

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,280
Huh?! An eel's talking to me?!

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,650
Stop drooling! I'm not an eel!

59
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,480
You're pretty hungry too, aren't you?

60
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,860
Don't be a fool.

61
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,070
As if a mere ten days without food
would cause a warrior's stomach to growl.

62
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,240
Ten days?!

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,930
Who are you, and what are you doing here?

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm Luffy, the man who's gonna be the Pirate King. { def: i assume this is a little more formal than his usual catch phrase }{Starfish: Nope. He says it exactly the same way he always does.}

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,130
P-P-P-Pi-Pir...

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,030
Stop lying.

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,900
A pirate would be bigger
and weigh at least 300 kg. {I actually had to do a bit of research to convert the weight}

68
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,210
They would be a lot stronger and fiercer as well.

69
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,250
I really don't care. But Eel...

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,180
How do- { def: manga has Luff calling him an eel here, which is necessary for the next line to make sense }

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,500
My name is Momonosuke!

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,480
I see, so you are a fellow outsider.

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,130
All that I have learned about this place
is that it is home to many ill children.

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,860
I don't know what kind of island this is
or what has happened to me.

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,810
This all began when I stowed away aboard a certain ship.

76
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:38,320
I did not want to involve myself with those children, yet they treated me with such kindness.

77
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,340
We're getting fed now. Aren't you gonna eat?

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,080
I am a samurai, I do not accept charity from others.

79
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,480
Even though they were so nice to me, I was on edge so...

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,800
I have your food here.

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,670
I told you I have no need of it!

82
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,510
You should eat something. We've all left our parents behind.

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,090
As if any of you could understand my feelings!

84
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,610
We should get alo-

85
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
I am Master Caesar.

86
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,080
Now, go inside.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,700
From now on, this will be your playground.

88
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,900
Hey, what's your name?

89
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,370
I have... no name!

90
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,570
Here are some snacks. { 8:21, 15:56 }

91
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,050
Help yourself.

92
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,020
I have no need of them!

93
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,380
How about some candy?

94
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,560
I have no need of it!

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,220
What? One of the kids has escaped?

96
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,280
Yeah, but according to the name list,
there's no one missing.

97
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,190
That's weird.

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,310
Hey you.

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,410
Hmm, so you're Momonosuke-kun?

100
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,850
This is the secret room.
You're not supposed to be in here.

101
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,990
Stop interacting with me. You are causing me trouble.

102
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,880
I am searching for a way out.

103
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,160
I am getting out of here.
There is something that I need to do.

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,810
It must be hard, but it's the same for all the kids here. { 10:53, 15:59 }

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,970
They all want to go home to their parents
as soon as possible.

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,330
We've gathered from different islands to get our disease treated. We all feel the same way.

107
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,320
I have a lot of things I want to do when I go home too.

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,840
Everyone gets along
and has heaps of fun in the Biscuits Room.

109
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,740
We can forget about all the painful stuff.

110
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,830
So you have to eat properly too, Momonosuke!

111
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,260
But I...

112
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,890
The door to the secret room is open.

113
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,790
Oh no! Someone's coming!
Let's go, Momonosuke-kun!

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,190
Is someone in here?

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
What's going on?

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,470
Who's that?

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,070
A-A dragon?!

118
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,030
What's going on?{ deftl: Where's it going? }

119
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,160
M-Momonosuke-kun has...

120
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,050
Look at this.

121
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,640
The artificial devil fruit that Vegapunk made
was inside this case.

122
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,420
Wasn't that a failed experiment?

123
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,450
Yeah, that's what I heard.

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,850
In other words, I am human.

125
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,590
So that's it. It's a devil fruit.

126
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,780
An eel-man?

127
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,460
Then why don't you just turn back into a human?

128
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,470
Huh? I can turn back into a human? How?

129
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,400
I dunno. I'm not a Zoan type.

130
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,220
But damn, how high is the roof?

131
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,370
I can't see the hole that I came through.

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,590
I want to get out through that hole
and inform the children of what I know!

133
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,170
I overheard...

134
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,880
...what that man called Caesar is truly planning.

135
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,220
Another bunch of well-behaved, obedient kids!

136
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,320
And the other kids are growing quite nicely.

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,730
However, this experiment tests
the limits of tolerance to this drug.

138
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,120
They won't last much longer.

139
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,200
All of them will probably be dead within 5 years.

140
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,390
Then we'll have to gather some more kids.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,610
But then again,
there are failures in every experiment.

142
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,630
It's an unavoidable sacrifice.

143
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,880
I thought he was a doctor,

144
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,190
but in fact, he is a terrible man who intends to let the children die!

145
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,240
I was on my way to tell the children,
but I fell down here whilst hiding in a trash can.

146
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,780
Caesar!

147
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,010
Alright, Momo!

148
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm getting out of here, and I'm taking you with me.

149
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,030
But how will you get all the way up there?

150
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,490
I'm gonna climb the wall. Hold onto me.

151
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,440
The kids are fine.

152
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,740
My crewmates have already gone to save them.

153
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Is that true?

154
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,990
They'll be able to handle the job.

155
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,220
There's no need to worry.

156
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,980
I see. You clearly cannot be just a mere...

157
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,210
pi... rate.

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,350
What's wrong?

159
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,440
Are you really that hungry?

160
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,700
Hey! Get a hold of yourself.

161
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Get a hold of yourself!

162
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,470
Get a hold of yourself!

163
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,050
We're flying!

164
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,400
Building B, 2nd Floor - Inner Area, Corridor To the Examination Room

165
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,160
Do you think they'll be okay without me?

166
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,900
Then again, Zoro's with them, so they should be fine.

167
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,820
Hey Brook, tell us if you find
those Sea Stone handcuffs that Robin wants. { def: shackles }{Starfish: They're both the same thing, aren't they? So by all means, if you think "shackles" sounds better then I have no objections.}

168
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,080
Forgive me for having to rely
on your sorcery, Sir Corpse!

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,410
Just leave it all to me.

170
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,230
Building D - SAD Manufacturing Room

171
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,540
Building B - Near the Biscuits Room

172
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,090
Everyone, this way to the kids in the Biscuits Room! {Welp, there goes the quality xD -Fadeout4}

173
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,720
That hurts, bro!

174
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,040
Stop being a crybaby!

175
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,360
Stop being crazy!

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Hurry it up! If you want to save the kids, then hurry to the Biscuits Room!

177
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,720
Building B, 3rd Floor - Biscuits Room

178
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,590
It's cold! There's a blizzard in this room!

179
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,720
As soon as I take my coat off
I run into the Snow ability?!

180
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,500
Damn that snow-woman!

181
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,510
Stop, everyone!  You can't eat that candy! {WELP, THERE REALLY GOES THE QUALITY! -Fadeout4}

182
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,320
Run, Mocha!

183
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,090
Stop running and give us the candy, Mocha!

184
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,210
No, everyone come to your senses!

185
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,070
Stop trying to hog it all for yourself.

186
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,370
Stop running!

187
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,370
I only need to slow them down a bit.

188
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,180
Don't interfere.{Starfish: OH NO!  MONET JUST STABBED ROBIN'S HAIR!!!}

189
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,970
Robin!

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,920
You guys go and stop the kids!

191
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,370
The enemy is a Logia.

192
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll fight her!

193
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,930
Are you okay, Robin?

194
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,430
I'm okay, it's just a scratch.{ Btwb: Scratch, piercing, whatever. }{Sev: TIS BUT A SCRATCH}

195
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,700
Let's hurry and stop the children.

196
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,010
Yeah.

197
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,460
Nami, the children are about to leave the room.

198
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,740
Wait up, Mocha!

199
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,140
I promised to stop them,
 and if we don't, it will put Mocha in danger!

200
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,820
Stop running!

201
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,840
Give us the candy!

202
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
I won't give it to you guys.

203
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,470
Chopper-chan told me what kind of candy this is.

204
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,620
You can't eat this candy.

205
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,250
Everyone, please return to normal!

206
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,360
It can't be helped, Mocha.

207
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,140
We're sick.

208
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,790
Adults will die if they catch our disease.

209
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,010
You'd be even sadder if your parents were to die, right?

210
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,310
They said that they'd treat and heal us in one year.

211
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,570
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Caesar Clown.

212
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,840
Call me Master.

213
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,060
You are my first generation of patients. 
I'm happy to be working with you.

214
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,110
I once lost my only son to this disease.{ Btwb: There's only one disease? }

215
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,570
I never want to see a child suffer from this disease again.

216
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:20,020
Nor do I want to see a fellow parent grieving over the loss of their children.

217
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,650
Ah, forgive me. How embarrassing, that you would see me cry.

218
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,400
Are you okay, Master-san?

219
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,630
Thank you, you're such a kind child.

220
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:40,580
That's right, I still haven't introduced you to the other sick children from other islands.

221
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm Uzu, pleased to meet you.

222
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,990
Candy...!

223
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm Doran.

224
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,710
Wait, Mocha!

225
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,850
My name is Konbu.

226
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
Give me some candy!

227
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,290
Some new friends have arrived today.

228
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,630
Make sure you all get along!

229
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,010
If anything happens, you can tell me.

230
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,840
Okay, Monet-san!

231
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,480
Even that kind Monet-san was lying.

232
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,270
It was all a lie!

233
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,870
This is a reward for doing so well in your treatment.

234
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,010
Some candy from Master.

235
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,830
Let's all escape from here,
so please just return to normal, everyone!

236
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,070
We have to catch up to the children.

237
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm counting on you.

238
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,850
You bitch!

239
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,610
What the hell are you playing at?!

240
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,410
Just wait a second!
Why are you coming over here?!

241
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,120
Wait, Nami! Stop!

242
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,440
Stop using me as a shield!

243
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,690
Darn, I missed.

244
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,480
Why are you targeting the weak ones?

245
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,720
Out of the way, Zoro!

246
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,630
Heat Egg!

247
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,220
So heat works.

248
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,890
Don't come over here anymore!

249
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,090
The Cat Burglar, with a bounty of 16 million belly.

250
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,030
Dammit, she dived into the snow again!

251
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you even want to fight, you damn snow-woman?!

252
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,200
The exit!{ Btwb: The "Huh?" was said a while before she says "The exit!", so I just removed it. Someone else can time it back in, if so desired. }

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,240
Oh no!{Starfish: "Dammit" doesn't strike me as the sort of thing Robin would say.}

254
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,370
Snow Fence!

255
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,560
Perpetual Snow!

256
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,700
Nami!

257
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,940
The snow...

258
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,590
It's so cold, I can't move!

259
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,830
She went after them again!

260
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,170
Look out, Chopper!

261
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,830
Cuatro Manos!

262
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,830
{\an8}Four Flowers

263
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,600
Spank!

264
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,420
Nami! {This line is super short but it goes from the end of a scene to the start of the next D: -Fadeout4}

265
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,400
That was scary.

266
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,160
How troublesome.

267
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,190
Those children are Master's precious guinea pigs,

268
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,950
and my mission is to protect Caesar and his experiment.{ Btwb: Just one of his experiments? }

269
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,640
Who was the one who made Mocha rebel against us?

270
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,600
What did you say?

271
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,330
Those children asked us to save them!

272
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,640
Get out of the way, you guys!

273
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,410
Get going.

274
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,220
Let's hurry.

275
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah.

276
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,510
Mocha, just hold on a bit longer!

277
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,500
Such uncivilized people.

278
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,270
Day after day, we treated them kindly,

279
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,800
and gave them a life with no problems.

280
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,270
And here you are, trying to rob us, their guardians, of the very thing that matters the most to us.{Starfish: She literally refers to them as "treasures".}

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,260
You people are just like pirates.

282
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,060
It seems like we're on the same page.

283
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,150
I told you it's uncivilized.

284
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,510
Stop interfering with my mission.

285
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,880
Sword Snow!

286
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,680
Skin Sword!

287
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,020
You've only been blocking my attacks.

288
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,280
Why won't you attack me?

289
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,440
To be honest, I didn't think I could win against you.

290
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,330
But that might not be the case.

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,670
There's another room in the back!

292
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,740
Let's find the kids and get out of here!

293
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,430
Isn't it kinda cold in here?!

294
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,660
The Navy?

295
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,170
Let's go through that door back there!{ Btwb: Sounds like Sanji, so I changed the actor. }

296
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,140
Everyone's trying to steal the children.

297
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,220
I won't let anyone take them.

298
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,920
Charge!

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,560
Why the hell are you leading them?!

300
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey bro, the kids aren't here, but Pirate Hunter Zoro is.

301
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,870
He's one arrogant bastard.

302
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
Alright, guys.

303
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,190
Pull down your lower lip and make fun of him!

304
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,110
They should all slip on the snow, hit their heads and die.{ Btwb: Not a technically correct sentence, but I'll let it slide since it sounds like something Zoro would say. }

305
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,890
Hey, Nami and Robin are through that door.

306
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,610
You're in the way, so hurry up and get going.

307
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,780
Wow, you may be an idiot, but that was some good information.

308
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,870
Alright, let's go, you g...{ Btwb: Added the ellipsis since it sounds like he started trailing off. }

309
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,800
Is what I want to say, but there's a beauty right here!

310
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,740
Seriously?!{These 2 sentences are said by two different people at the same time.}

311
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,740
She's so cute! {These 2 sentences are said by two different people at the same time.}

312
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,370
You guys are annoying! Hurry up and go on ahead!

313
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,190
But take a closer look. She doesn't look human.

314
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,620
A human-faced bird?

315
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,130
It's a Harpy!{ Btwb: Not sure if should be capitalized... }

316
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,940
B-But...

317
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,700
besides that, she's damn cute!

318
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,570
In fact, it makes her even cuter.

319
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,520
Man, she's sexy!

320
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,060
Why are you weak to compliments?!{Starfish: Despite being the one who wrote this, I do not like this phrasing. Plz do something about it.}

321
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,290
So, why is it snowing in here?

322
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,960
No matter who they are, I won't let anyone take the children away.

323
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,990
What's happened to my shoulder?!

324
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,210
You bitch!

325
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,930
S-She's a Logia!

326
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,000
Damn that woman.

327
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,290
A swordswoman that uses Haki?!

328
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,510
Captain-chan!

329
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,980
I temporarily stopped the gas from entering this room.

330
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,660
But, it might leak in from somewhere else.

331
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,390
We don't have much time.
Everyone go after the children!

332
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,410
What are you going to do?

333
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,110
I'm going to stay here.

334
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,270
I figured I'm needed here!

335
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,410
Huh?!
