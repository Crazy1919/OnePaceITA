1
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,860
Oh!  Master!

2
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,860
Ruins of Laboratory #1 and #2

3
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,460
I got all this stuff sticking outta me!

4
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,480
It's a furball!

5
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,250
That's Guard Point!

6
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,640
Just by visualizing them,
you can freely transform between six different forms.

7
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,340
This body ain't very stable!

8
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,930
It takes practice!

9
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,020
Hey!  Don't play on me!

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,650
What did you say?!  The samurai left?!

11
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,470
Yes.

12
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,790
Dammit!  I thought that it's been too quiet!

13
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,700
Just a short while ago, I told him about a fellow I met who's nothing but a torso.

14
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,930
He wanted to know where I had met him...

15
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,400
and I told him that we parted ways near the lake.

16
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,610
Then he ran out of here.

17
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,910
I was distracted by Nami-san's glorious body
so I let my guard down!

18
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,640
Even though it's inconvenient for you?

19
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,280
The one who took him outside
when he was just a head who couldn't move...

20
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,460
was me.

21
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,660
It might have been uncalled for, but it was what I had to do.

22
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,230
If he gets killed now, it'll be my fault.

23
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,640
I see.

24
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,050
Even though he's a samurai, he doesn't have a torso to hold a sword so all he can do is run away from battle.

25
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,470
Well then, shall we go and do what we must?

26
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,220
That goddamn asshole.

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,670
Luffy!  I'm gonna head out for a bit, okay?

28
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,880
Yeah, sure.

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,510
Okay, I'll show you the way...

30
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,340
so may I see your panties?

31
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,850
For sure!

32
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,850
Oh, right!  We need a camera for an opportunity like this!

33
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,880
Stop right there!

34
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,930
Zoro, you're going too.

35
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,640
Huh?

36
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,930
If Zoro is there,
Sanji-kun will be in fight-mode at all times!

37
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,250
Why do I need to search for that farting samurai just because you're an idiot?!  You pervert!

38
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,400
No one wants you here, anyway!

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,780
I can't believe I'm stuck with a dumbass
who I can't even share this happiness with!

40
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,780
I was mercilessly struck.
Do you think my bones were broken?

41
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,520
No, all that's broken is my dream to see those panties.

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,020
Idiot!

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,120
Pervert!

44
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,620
So, what should we do about your bodies?

45
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,180
The most important thing to do now
is get our bodies back.

46
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,470
I don't want to be this pervert for another millisecond!

47
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,310
Are you trying to kill me with praise?

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,690
Please don't make that face with Chopper's body.

49
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,230
Ever.

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,070
The real problem is those damn kids. They're a real pain in the ass.

51
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,720
Franky, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't speak with that face.

52
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,630
Ever.

53
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,370
No!

54
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,480
That's not what I want!

55
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,670
Raccoon Dog-chan, how does it look?

56
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,500
We'll know in a moment.

57
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,250
Huh!  That means...

58
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,610
What happened?  Sind?  Are you hurt?

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,660
Are you okay?

60
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,090
What happened?!

61
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,150
It hurts...

62
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,530
Chopper.  He says it hurts.

63
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,040
Cure him.

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,510
Mocha!

65
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,950
What's happening to all of you?

66
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,130
Doran, too?

67
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,130
All the big kids are collapsing!

68
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,000
What happened?

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,540
Chopper, what is it?  Are the kids really sick?

70
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,560
No.

71
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,100
Sind, is there anything that you want right now?

72
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,570
What do you usually do at times like this?

73
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,400
Usually?

74
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,650
After the examination... then...

75
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,340
Then what?

76
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,900
Then they give us candy.

77
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,760
Candy?

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,510
It's delicious.

79
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,490
Everyone loves the candy.

80
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,790
It's really great.

81
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,060
It's all fizzy and smoke comes out.

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,920
That's right... We eat it...

83
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,720
And when you eat it...

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,930
you get this happy feeling.

85
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,940
It might make me feel better.

86
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,310
Brownbeard, was it?

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,100
What do you know about this?

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,590
These kids aren't sick!

89
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,670
What are you talking about?  I patrol outside,
so I don't know what goes on in the laboratory...

90
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,680
but those kids have a serious disease!

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,990
Hang in there, kids.

92
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,350
Hey, Chopper.

93
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,960
Even the little ones look like they're starting to hurt.

94
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,490
The ever-compassionate Master
went out of his way to gather those kids,

95
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,280
and he's been donating his medical knowledge
to treat them.

96
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,380
He's a tenderhearted scientist!

97
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,650
It hurts...

98
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,740
Ally?

99
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,510
Look, there's your proof!

100
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,290
After missing a single day of treatment,
those kids have already started to collapse from pain.

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,370
No!

102
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,940
Chopper, what have you learned?

103
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,580
NHC-10.  That's what I found in the kids' bodies.

104
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,660
There were only faint traces, but it's...

105
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,100
a narcotic!

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,750
A narcotic?!

107
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,270
Throughout the world, only a few scientists in select countries are allowed to have it.

108
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,660
I know about it because Doctorine used it.

109
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,390
There are some legitimate uses for the drug,
but only in the smallest amounts.

110
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,140
It's extremely addictive if you take too much.

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,380
The children have been taking the drug every day for a long time now.

112
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,560
They've become chronically addicted to it.

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,320
Their bodies crave the next dose in order to stop the pain.

114
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,920
Why?!  Why would they have this in their system?!

115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,060
It's so that they can't run away from the lab, isn't it?!

116
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,610
What is this "god of salvation" of yours really doing to these kids?!

117
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,180
If you speak ill of Master, you'll pay for it!

118
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,150
Chopper, what do we do?
They're all collapsing, one after another!

119
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,290
Candy!  Candy!

120
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,170
You need candy?
Should I go get some from the building?

121
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,230
No!

122
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,700
They must never eat the candy again!

123
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,920
They've been using it to give the drug to the children
without them knowing it!

124
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,260
Strawhat man.

125
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,360
You'll bring me the candy?

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,010
I can't.  If Chopper says you can't have it,
then you can't have it.

127
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,470
He's our doctor.  Trust him!

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,100
Why?

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,720
Why?  Why?

130
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,970
Sind, what happened?

131
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,580
I'm scared.

132
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,200
You said that you'd bring me some!

133
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,430
Didn't you!?  Didn't you say that you'd bring me some!

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,930
What strength!

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Stop it, Sind!

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,780
I've never seen Sind like this before.

137
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,050
What strength!

138
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,700
Giants are pretty strong, I guess their children are too.

139
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,770
This strong?

140
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,820
Why won't you give me the candy?!

141
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,150
Sind's not a giant!

142
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,810
We were all normal size when we came to this island.

143
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,670
I thought the disease was making us get bigger.

144
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,060
Nothing else is wrong with us.

145
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,550
There's no disease
that makes normal humans grow into giants.

146
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,720
Giants are always giant.

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,740
The longer a kid has been here, the bigger they become.

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
That means...

149
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,540
their pituitary glands have started producing an abnormal amount of growth hormone.

150
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,730
Candy!

151
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,170
These kids...

152
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,680
are being experimented on!

153
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,290
Candy!

154
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,930
Hold yourself together, Ally!

155
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,520
I want candy!

156
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,490
What was this "Master" thinking,

157
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,430
using narcotics on such young kids?!

158
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,520
Candy!

159
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,390
The other kids are starting to go wild!

160
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,400
Candy!  Candy!  Candy!

161
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,450
There's nothing we can do.

162
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,770
Nami!

163
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,830
Sind!  Quit it!

164
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,080
Should I fight 'em?

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,040
No!  Outta the way, Luffy!

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,920
Usopp!  Don't hurt them!

167
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,870
Idiot!  Of course I know that!

168
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,640
I knew that they must have been kidnapped.

169
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,900
Let us out of here!{cp583}

170
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,650
I wanna see Mommy and Daddy!{cp583}

171
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,300
Luffy.

172
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,730
It's tragic.  They don't even know that they've been manipulated.

173
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,190
They want to go home!
They want to be with their parents!

174
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,940
We have to help them!

175
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,020
Luffy, I want to save them too.

176
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,320
Well then, I guess we'll take 'em all home.

177
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,530
Stupid, it's not that easy.
There's a mountain of problems!

178
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,140
That's right.  Besides, this is all just our interpretation.

179
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,750
Unless we ask the ringleader directly, we won't know any of this for sure.

180
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,840
Isn't it that Master guy?

181
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,640
But Zoro, Sanji, and Brook
went to go look for that samurai.

182
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,130
Uh... Well, whatever.

183
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,250
Right!  Let's go back to the laboratory...

184
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,470
to find Master.

185
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,930
I should stay here.

186
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,490
I can never forgive Master...

187
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,380
and I want to kick his ass...

188
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,140
but I'm worried about the children.

189
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
I have to look after them.

190
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,350
Ye-Yeah!  That's right!  I'll also have to stay!

191
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,310
Hey Nami!  That's a dirty trick!  You're just scared!

192
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,940
But it'll be pretty bad if the kids get violent again.

193
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,600
We'll tie the big ones up like this.

194
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,430
I don't like it, but...

195
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,540
There's no helping it.
They're heavyweights when they get violent.

196
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,320
And we don't know when they'll wake up.

197
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,940
So, who's going to go where?

198
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,090
The four of us have to get together and meet Trafalgar,

199
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,770
or we won't get our bodies back.

200
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,970
But it's fine the way it is!

201
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,750
This is definitely not fine!  Take it seriously!

202
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,360
The heart of Smoker, Vice Admiral of Navy Unit G-5.

203
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,490
What a thoughtful present, Law.

204
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,450
There's no doubt who won that battle.

205
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:02,160
They'll want to report what happened, and since
they lost their ship they'll come to take one of ours.

206
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,060
Of course, I've already made arrangements.

207
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,270
What about Straw-Hatter?

208
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,140
He's not a problem either.

209
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,020
His crew is being dealt with,
and the children will be brought back.

210
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:23,490
Well, the kids will eventually want to come back
even if they're left alone.

211
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,820
Monet says that we should take appropriate caution when dealing with the Straw Hat Pirates.

212
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,510
That's why I chose to send the duo after them.

213
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,050
The two who never miss their mark.

214
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,140
The hit men of the mountain.

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,570
The Yeti Cool Brothers.

216
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,570
Only six left.

217
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,260
I thought they'd give us more trouble...

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,410
but it's probably best if we finish it quickly.

219
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,850
Just like these three...

220
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,760
Coolly.

221
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,670
It's me.  Right off the top,
we took care of three of them.

222
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,350
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

223
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,270
The Cat Burglar.

224
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,200
The Soul King.

225
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,240
You'll find the corpses
at the bottom of a cliff in zone F-16.

226
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,850
We'll leave the disposal to you.

227
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,810
You killed them?

228
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,280
Isn't that why we're here?

229
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,030
Well... I guess it's...

230
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,200
If you don't want people to die, then don't call us!

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,730
S-Sorry!  Master said either way was...

232
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,850
Hey, hey.  Don't get hot under the collar.

233
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,600
Woops, I slipped.

234
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,060
Let's go, coolly.

235
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,990
Please continue with the contract.

236
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,920
Caesar Clown's Laboratory

237
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,760
Did you hear that?  They're already dead, Monet.

238
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,730
I see.

239
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,840
How unexpected.

240
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,290
The Straw Hat Pirates are members of
the Worst Generation, the same as Law.

241
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,760
The government is keeping just as close an eye
on them as they are on Blackbeard.

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,530
The newspapers made grand claims
that they had completely recovered,

243
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,380
so I thought they'd be more impressive.

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,450
Don't you agree, Law?

245
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,420
You know them, don't you?

246
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,030
Two years ago at Sabaody, and again at Marineford...

247
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,750
You've gotten involved with Straw Hat twice.

248
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

249
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,290
Does this mean that you called them here?

250
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,880
Didn't I already tell you this?

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,670
Until we crossed paths at the entrance,
I had no idea that you'd locked them in the laboratory.

252
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,930
If I had known, I would have warned you.

253
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,450
Don't let your guard down
just because you've locked them in a room.

254
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Because of your naivety,
I wasn't able to bluff the Navy into going away.

255
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,400
I don't want what's going on here to leak out
any more than you do.

256
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,180
Master!

257
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,370
I'm doing an experiment.  Call later.

258
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,250
But a Warlord's here!

259
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,860
What?

260
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,690
You're going to stay on Punk Hazard?

261
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,350
It took a lot of effort for me to get to this island
since it can't be reached with a Log.

262
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,050
I did it because there was
a hidden Government facility here.

263
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,180
What's your objective?

264
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,040
Since Dr. Vegapunk formerly used this lab,

265
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,240
there should still be evidence
of what the World Government is up to.

266
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,240
That is to say, projects that they're working on today
should have started here.

267
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,000
Anyway, as long as I'm free to walk around
the island and laboratory, that'll be sufficient.

268
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,790
I can help you out around here, as well.

269
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,730
Neither of us has to get involved in the other's business.  Of course, don't tell anyone that I'm here.

270
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,590
Not even Joker.

271
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,220
You seem very well informed!  How do you know about him?

272
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,990
Would you prefer it if I was an ignorant fool that didn't know what he was doing?

273
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,650
Well now, aren't we two birds of a feather?

274
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,790
We can't trust each other,
but your proposition seems harmless.

275
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,370
Right, Monet?

276
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,330
From North Blue, the Surgeon of Death.

277
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,760
You have the Ope Ope Fruit ability.  I see that you're a doctor.

278
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,580
On this island, there are many ex-convicts
who lost the use of their legs to the poison gas.

279
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,090
Can you help them?

280
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,470
Well, if you'd actually called for help,
I imagine you'd have been more clever about it.

281
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,920
You went through all of the effort of ingratiating yourself to the Government and becoming a Warlord,

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,030
so I suppose you wouldn't try to expose this island.

283
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,870
Sorry.

284
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,780
A moment ago...

285
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,540
you said that if you left the kids from
the Biscuits Room alone, they'd come back.

286
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,150
What did you mean by that?

287
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,210
Every day I give them a drug-laced candy.

288
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,150
It's sweet and fizzy to the taste...

289
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,820
and releases an intoxicating gas into the mouth.

290
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,800
They're all addicted to it.

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,840
I can't have them going back home, after all.

292
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,390
You're twisted, alright.
Reminds me of a certain someone.

293
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,890
Aren't you going to join the battle with the Navy?

294
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,710
If you need me, call me.

295
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,490
I'll cut the head off of anyone you need.

296
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,440
It's hard to handle people who are so sharp.

297
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,150
There it is again!  What is going on?!

298
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,010
This isn't an earthquake.

299
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,150
Are we under attack?  It's an enemy!

300
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
Was that an explosion?

301
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,000
It's in the direction we came from.

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,970
Could it have something to do
with whoever made this footprint?

303
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,620
There's something out there, alright.

304
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,980
They feel like monsters.  Two of 'em!

305
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,470
Let's go back!  Nami and Chopper are in trouble!

306
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,530
Y-Yeah!

307
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,010
Oh no!  If this place collapses, the children will...

308
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,320
Luffy!  Come back here!

309
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,750
They'll never make it in time!
The two of us have to deal with this!

310
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,440
Can you see them, Chopper?

311
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,550
How many enemies are there?  What are they like?

312
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,230
There's...

313
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,890
nobody out here at all!

314
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,310
There's no way.

315
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,350
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

316
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,240
Oh, I fell asleep.

317
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,500
It's getting noisy out there.
Is somebody here to save me?

318
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,250
Law?  Master?

319
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,390
No, this is the snow mountain...

320
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,850
so it's got to be them!

321
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,320
Hey, Brownie!  You know something.

322
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,830
Who's coming?

323
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,710
You'd better answer, or else I'll do this!

324
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,970
Beam!

325
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,360
Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!

326
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,740
Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!

327
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,860
Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!

328
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,800
Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!

329
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,320
You're disrespecting the beam!

330
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,950
Searching for them is pointless. They never show themselves.

331
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,300
Even we don't know what their faces look like.

332
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,090
But once you hire them
and give them their money, they always get the kill.

333
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,920
All we know about them is that their feet are huge,
but their voices are quiet.

334
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:44,560
Oh, and another thing we know is that
they are giant beast-men covered in fur!

335
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,020
They're the hit man duo
who appear in blizzards on the mountain.

336
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,870
Oh yeah, we also know their names, Rock and Scotch.

337
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,900
People call them...

338
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
the Yeti Cool Brothers!

339
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,690
They were born in an undisclosed snowy country,
and their ages are-

340
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,910
You know loads of stuff about them!

341
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,620
But nobody knows what they look like.

342
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,580
They're both gigantic and powerful!

343
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,180
They've come to save me.

344
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,260
You're already on their hit list.

345
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,000
Brownbeard?

346
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,520
You're on the hit list as well.

347
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,070
What's with this guy?!

348
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,050
He's huge, but I didn't hear him at all!

349
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,220
Wha?!  Are you Rock?

350
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,370
I'm Scotch.

351
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,930
I thought you said something ridiculous.

352
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,880
I must have misheard you.

353
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,430
I nearly had a heart attack.

354
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,450
Master must have contracted you to save me?

355
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,520
So hurry up and free me from these chains,
then kill the Straw Hat-

356
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,350
You didn't mishear me.  Master put a hit on you.

357
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,290
There's no way!

358
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,990
Listen to this.

359
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,280
Oh, and that guy... What was his name again?

360
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,460
That voice!

361
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,220
He went and got himself captured.

362
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,300
That stupid hairy-faced man...
He was famous for being an idiot.

363
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,620
Ohhh right, Brownbeard.

364
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,890
Eh, Master?!

365
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,460
That's him?

366
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,980
He's an idiot so he's easy to use,
but he has become a burden.

367
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,110
We don't need him anymore.

368
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,960
Kill him.

369
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,420
Hey, look!  There's smoke!

370
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,780
Nami!  Chopper!  Are you okay?!

371
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,500
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

372
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,130
You did well to make it this far.

373
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,240
You're all better now.  You can relax.

374
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,460
Good work.

375
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,970
Master!  Today was quiet, as normal!

376
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,710
I see.  Brownbeard, you are a most reliable guard.

377
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,100
Oh, not at all.

378
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,760
I don't believe it.

379
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,270
I don't believe it.

380
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,980
I don't believe it!

381
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,690
Master!

382
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,860
Don't be so hot-headed.  Die coolly.

383
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,190
Hey Scotch.

384
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,210
There's another one!

385
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,840
Quit shooting.
You'll bring this place down and kill the kids.

386
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,260
Oh.  That wouldn't be cool.

387
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,180
Brownbeard!

388
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,940
How terrible!  Their own ally!

389
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,770
Look there, the captain has come back.

390
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,330
Taking them out comes first.

391
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,710
What's that?  They're huge!

392
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,790
Giants?

393
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,660
No, they look a little bit different.

394
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,590
You better not have hurt my crew!

395
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,350
Wha... He's gone!

396
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,520
Luffy!

397
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,120
Are you okay?!

398
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,290
Sorry!  They got Nami!

399
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,860
This is the only one
that we're supposed to capture alive.

400
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,460
A robot with Vegapunk's laser, huh?

401
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,720
Now we can kill everyone else.

402
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,930
Okay.  Let's enjoy the hunt as much as possible.

403
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,620
Coolly.

404
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,420
Laboratory - Backdoor

405
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,740
Huh?

406
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,100
Law-san, where are you headed?

407
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,190
We just ran into the Navy not too far from here!

408
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,730
I don't care.

409
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Where I go... is my business.
