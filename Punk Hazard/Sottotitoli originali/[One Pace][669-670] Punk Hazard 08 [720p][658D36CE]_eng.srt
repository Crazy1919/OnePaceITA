1
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,390
I guess... I must have hit my head when we fell.

2
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,180
Me too, my head hurts quite a bit.

3
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,280
I can't believe we lost him.
I wonder if the samurai's still okay.

4
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,050
Says the guy who took us on a massive detour.

5
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,910
All of us just followed the path, didn't we?!

6
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,590
Sadly we never managed to find
the abominable snowman, even after searching.

7
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,120
But I'll never forget those shadows I saw.

8
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,100
It wasn't the abominable snowman.  Don't get carried away.

9
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,980
You said the whole thing
was just an ambush, didn't you?

10
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,430
I did not!

11
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,550
Well, I'm still not a believer.

12
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,750
I believe they exist!

13
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,630
I believe that I need more evidence before I decide.

14
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,050
Wow, that's a very good position to take.

15
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,040
You really are mature.

16
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,730
Well, I have been alive and dead for many years.

17
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,810
Indecision is a sign of weakness.

18
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,690
What?

19
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,320
Hey!  Samurai-san!  Where are you?{begin cp591}

20
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,900
Don't you dare hurt Nami's beautiful body!{secondary line}

21
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,130
Hey, both of you!  Please come look at this!

22
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,220
Footprints!

23
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,730
Th-This is...{end cp591, continue flashback}

24
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,420
You don't suppose these could be
the footprints of the legendary abominable snowman?!

25
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,900
Hey now, how can you say something so stupid?

26
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,140
Wow, really?!
Mysterious footprints on a snow covered mountain?!

27
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,870
They're huge, aren't they?!  I can't believe it!

28
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,610
And they're fresh!

29
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,460
If we follow them, then...

30
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,530
We'll solve a mystery of the unknown!

31
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,320
A dead end?

32
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,650
What are they?  There are giant shadows behind us!

33
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,070
Could it be the abominable-

34
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,690
What's this gas?!

35
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:05,560
It'sh like I'm drunk or somethin...
Shuddenly my tung feelsh all heavy... An' I'm sleeby...

36
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,320
C-C-Could dis be an ambuth?

37
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,190
No matter how good your alcohol tolerance is, if you breath in KYP gas...

38
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,100
you will experience a drunken state
and overwhelming drowsiness.

39
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,980
And at the bottom of the cliff is zone F-16.

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
You will not be able to escape the ice spikes!

41
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,620
So these three will fall first.

42
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,500
Spikes?!

43
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,270
Hey, guys!

44
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,220
T-That was close.

45
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,080
This is zone F-16.  We found the three Straw Hat
pirates exactly where they were reported to be.

46
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
We'll dispose of the corpses now.

47
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,730
Who're you calling a corpse?

48
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,940
What?!  She's alive!

49
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,110
But it's only one woman against all of us-

50
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,260
I don't care how many
of you third-rate weaklings there are.

51
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,830
It's all the same to me!

52
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,870
I gotta be careful.

53
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,280
After all, this is the body of the delicate Nami-san.

54
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,960
It'd be a crime to leave any scars on it.

55
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,560
Forgive me, Nami-san.  Just one cig.

56
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,690
Now then...

57
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,050
Get up, you idiots!{end flashback}

58
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,750
Anyway, the time
for mysteries of the unknown is over.

59
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,370
So, is this the area the samurai went?

60
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,650
Yes.

61
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,650
I presume he's searching for his torso somewhere around the lake.

62
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,680
Well, we're almost to the lake.

63
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,790
Samurai-san!

64
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,660
Hey!  Samurai!

65
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,430
Get out here, Samurai!

66
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,290
Samurai!

67
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,460
Were you killed in battle?

68
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,360
Get out here!  You okay?

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,870
Samurai!

70
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,650
Do you hear me, Samurai-san?!

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,020
I really wonder where he went.

72
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,760
Do you think he got his torso
and went off to find that kid of his?

73
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,330
Huh?

74
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,930
Isn't this the samurai?!

75
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,560
What the... he's frozen!

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,800
Hey, hey!

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,110
Cold!

78
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,860
Hey, are you okay?

79
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,410
Did somebody attack you?

80
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,650
For some unknown reason,
I was frozen and on the verge of meeting my demise!

81
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,450
You mean you were freezing to death in the blizzard?!

82
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,160
No!  I-I-I-It is not even remotely cold!

83
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,340
Damn you're stubborn!

84
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,710
A warrior does not feel cold!

85
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,740
Man, this guy's a pain.

86
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,500
Put some clothes on!

87
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,170
Isn't your power the ability to create clothes?!

88
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,650
A-Actually, because of that magic, I have a weak point.

89
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,210
I-I can't claim to be a strong swimmer...

90
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,880
You sink!  Everyone knows that!

91
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,690
S-So it seems that my torso...

92
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,310
has f-fallen in water.

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,240
In water?

94
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,430
I-I'm certain!

95
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,360
I can feel that my torso's underwater...

96
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,570
I see.  So that's why you were laying here freezing.

97
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,930
If your body's in the water,
then you can't use your ability.

98
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,950
If it's in water, then do you think
that maybe it fell in that lake, Brook?

99
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,920
I would think so.
I heard that the lake's technically part of the ocean.

100
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,770
If he's still alive,

101
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,740
then that means the sharks haven't gotten it yet.

102
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,850
But we have no idea what else is in that lake.

103
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,870
We'd better pull it out as fast as possible.

104
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,180
Yes, let's hurry.

105
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,060
I-If it's in the lake... then I'll have to dive for it...

106
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,300
We get it!  You swim like a hammer, right?

107
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
Bungling samurai.

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,880
You're pirates, aren't you?!

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,910
Why would you go so far
to help someone you've never met before?

110
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,570
I told you,
I know the difference between right and wrong!

111
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,510
And I wanna settle our fight
after I put you back together!

112
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,570
I'm gonna give you a beating.

113
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,170
F-Forgive me.

114
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,590
I'm indebted to you.

115
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,700
Oh, so I see you learned how to express gratitude.

116
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,890
I guess some people
improve with a little freezing now and again.

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,600
What's that?

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,110
I was wondering myself.

119
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,220
Th-That's...

120
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,250
Brownbeard-san's underling-taurs,
whom we stripped of clothes!

121
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,990
Pull yourself together!  You gotta run!

122
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,420
Get away from the lake!

123
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,320
There's a monster on the other side!

124
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
We have to report it to Master!

125
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,100
Where could something like that have been hiding on this island?!

126
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,910
Just run!  The monster's coming!

127
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,730
Huh?  A monster?  Aren't you guys all monsters?

128
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,710
It's those damned thieving pirates from before!

129
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,170
Dammit, that's my coat!

130
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,210
Leave the coat!  Run!  Just get back to the laboratory!

131
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,840
Those guys took out the boss!

132
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,700
We won't forget!

133
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,270
What was that about?

134
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,920
I have no idea.

135
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,500
Hey, Brook.  They were coming
from the direction of the lake, weren't they?

136
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,130
Whoa!  That's right!  You actually got that right!

137
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,310
That's amazing, Zoro-san!

138
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,680
But why are you looking like that?

139
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,010
Well, I don't quite remember...

140
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,970
there being a mountain there.

141
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,120
Hmm... a mountain?

142
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,030
W-What is that thing?!

143
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,880
Smiley is the explosion that destroyed Punk Hazard
four years ago, a living chemical weapon!

144
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,130
Did they really believe
that I would just destroy all the gas on the island?

145
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,520
No!

146
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,100
Who would waste such a precious thing?

147
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,400
I compressed it and turned it into a monster!

148
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,500
A monster named Smiley!

149
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,640
This island was an unlivable hellscape due to what enveloped it!

150
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,900
People can forget such tragedies all too quickly,

151
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,610
but it hasn't gone anywhere!

152
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,640
It's still right here in the palm of my hand!

153
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,140
They've captured the ship!

154
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,150
Stop the ship!

155
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,860
Quit playing around!  Hurry and wrap it up!

156
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,780
S-Smoker-san!  How do I change back to normal?

157
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,910
You're in the way!  Just sit there and be quiet!

158
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,960
Don't you have the door open yet?!

159
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,450
Our enemy is inside the lab.

160
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,740
We can't just waste time out here until we die!

161
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,090
It's no use!  The door won't budge an inch, Smo-san!

162
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,770
What a load of crap.

163
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,350
If only I had my body,
breaking into this place wouldn't be a problem.

164
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,630
Your power sure is useful!

165
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,230
Did we just teleport?

166
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,620
Get into the bag and stay quiet.

167
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,910
We're already at the back entrance of the lab.

168
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,080
The main experiment room
will have Caesaro and a woman in it.

169
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,170
I'll get them out of there one way or another.

170
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,930
When that happens, you investigate the drugs.

171
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,680
But you're so strong
and can easily get close to Master.

172
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,620
Why don't you just capture him yourself?

173
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,110
Then I could have all the time in the world
to investigate the drugs.

174
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,840
I have my reasons for not doing that.  It's why I need your strength.

175
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,000
Anyway,
the faster you guys can kidnap Caesaro the better.

176
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Then I'll take care of the rest.

177
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,370
Hey!  Look at that!

178
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,210
Something's flying toward us!

179
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,990
It's a giant bomb!

180
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,010
No, it's something else!

181
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,840
Bam!

182
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,350
"Bam!"?  Was that a person?

183
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,430
Damn!

184
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,000
That was a pretty good shortcut!

185
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,030
Master!  Get out here!

186
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,520
I'm gonna kick your ass and kidnap you!

187
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,100
Luffy, you're supposed to keep that a secret.

188
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,330
Straw Hat?!

189
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,860
It's the Straw Hat Pirates!

190
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,990
Go, Luffy!

191
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,910
That idiot.

192
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,420
Who told him to take on the entire Navy?

193
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,790
Where are you Master?!  Get out here!

194
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,060
It's amazing!  I can hardly believe my eyes.

195
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,340
Oh, wait... I don't have any eyes.

196
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,370
Caesar's Laboratory - Main Entrance

197
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,820
Did that bastard just say that he's going to
kick our beloved Master's ass and kidnap him?!

198
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,720
What a joke!  Kill the Straw Hat Pirates!

199
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,650
We got here alright, but where's Master?

200
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,110
I doubt he'd hang around outside.

201
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,490
Then where is he?

202
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,710
Probably inside the lab.

203
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,580
I see.
Then I guess we have to get through that giant door.

204
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,470
Let's go.

205
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,470
Straw Hat Luffy!

206
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,870
What are you plotting on this island?

207
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,700
Smoke-man!  I'm so glad you're alright!

208
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,590
It looked like you took a beating earlier,
so I was worried.

209
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,050
Don't mock me.

210
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,850
Huh?  Does your stomach hurt?  Are you constipated?

211
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,220
It flew!

212
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,420
What's with you, Smoke-man?  You've gotten weak.

213
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,160
N-No, that's not it.  I'm...

214
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,620
And besides,
the way you've been talking has been weird, too.

215
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,410
Hey, give me a damn break!

216
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,470
Don't lose to him in my body!

217
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,170
Huh, that weapon!

218
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,280
So you're back on the seas, huh, Straw Hat?

219
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,020
But I won't let you do as you please!

220
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,290
I got hit!

221
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,890
That's right... There's Sea Stone in that thing!

222
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,800
When did Four-eyes get this strong?

223
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,590
What was her name again?

224
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm Smoker!

225
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Luffy, this is certainly Law's doing.

226
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,730
Oh, they've swapped bodies.  I see.

227
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
No wonder he's so weak.

228
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,920
So that means...

229
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,640
you're...

230
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,080
Smoke-man?!

231
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,700
What're you laughing at?!

232
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,290
Fight me, Straw Hat!

233
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,930
I can't catch him!

234
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,500
Our fight will have to wait 'til next time!

235
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,470
What're you saying?

236
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,540
There's no point in fighting
if you aren't at full strength!

237
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,120
Cocky bastard!

238
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,840
See ya later, Smoke-man!

239
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,320
They blew a hole in the door!

240
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,520
Who is that guy?

241
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,760
Was that a laser?!

242
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,490
Luffy, Robin!  I busted the door open!  Let's go in!

243
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,490
Wow, you work fast, Franky!

244
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,820
Smokey!

245
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,140
Something strange is flying toward us!

246
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,670
Over there!

247
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,570
What is that?

248
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,810
What...

249
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,970
is that?

250
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,740
Luffy, Franky, wait!

251
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,470
Wh-What is that?

252
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,270
It's poison gas!  Get back!

253
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,160
If you cut or shoot it, then poison gas comes out.

254
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,450
Get your gas masks on!  Hurry!

255
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,530
Eh?  What's that?

256
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,570
Is it alive?

257
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,590
What could it possibly be?  I have no idea.

258
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,300
Hey!  What the hell is that?

259
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,460
I don't know.  I've never seen anything like it.

260
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,410
It fell from the sky, right?

261
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,010
Yeah, but it's moving.

262
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,820
Man, how creepy.

263
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,270
Is that thing alive?

264
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,600
Look at that!

265
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,830
They're merging and growing bigger.

266
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,710
We should just push it into the river.

267
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,490
Hey!  Don't do that!

268
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,890
More poison gas!

269
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,640
Pull him out!

270
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,800
Heave, ho!

271
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,010
Oh man...

272
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
My skin!  It hurts!  Do something!  Anybody!

273
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,490
Hey, get a cloth or something!

274
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,830
I knew you shouldn't touch it!

275
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,170
What do we do?

276
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,770
I don't know!

277
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
You guys can fall back!

278
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,260
This thing looks like it'd be weak against fire.

279
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,070
Let's burn it down!

280
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,910
Yeah!

281
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,420
Take this!

282
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,220
There ain't a creature alive that isn't afraid of fire!

283
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,490
Damn, you're smart.

284
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,080
Kill it with fire!

285
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,530
I knew fire would work.  Serves you right!

286
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,130
It's starting to burn!  It doesn't like it at all!

287
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,390
My men!

288
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,700
What was that?

289
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,230
No clue.  First time I've ever seen anything like it.

290
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,610
It's poisonous to touch, and it blows up if you burn it.

291
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,510
I couldn't even tell if it was alive or not!

292
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,590
Well, whatever it was... it's dead now.

293
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,090
Yeah, you're right.

294
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,790
And what's more,
the explosion took out the marines stealing the ship.

295
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,720
It worked out pretty good for us!

296
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,800
It's back!

297
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,880
Look at the sky!

298
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,260
Those are all the same as the first one?

299
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,680
There's so many of them.

300
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,210
They're falling like rain!

301
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,500
Run away!  And don't touch them!

302
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,110
Smoker-san.  It's too dangerous to stay here.

303
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,730
We need to find shelter.

304
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,580
What a good boy!
I'm sorry I had you locked up for three years.

305
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,700
Master!

306
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,460
Why are you out here?  It's too dangerous!

307
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,130
I knew it.

308
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,110
There's no doubt about it.  You're Caesar Clown!

309
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,840
Are you that Master guy?

310
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,660
Indeed I am.

311
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,370
Get a good look at me,
Straw Hat Pirate Crew and Navy G-5 division.

312
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,880
I am the number one scientist in the world!

313
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,640
Master Caesar Clown!

314
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,660
It won't be long now.

315
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,540
He doesn't like the water...

316
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:38,670
so he's launching little pieces of himself over here
so that he can get across the lake.

317
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,050
From the Burning Lands to the Frozen Lands!

318
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,710
Once every single piece has made it over here...

319
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,200
you will get the full taste of...

320
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,670
the living chemical weapon that is the explosion that laid waste to Punk Hazard four years ago.

321
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,830
It turned this island into a landscape of death
where nothing could survive!

322
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,290
Is that thing alive?

323
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,060
I have no idea.  I've never seen anything like it.

324
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,600
A mysterious thing...

325
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,920
...doing mysterious things.

326
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,190
Gotcha!
