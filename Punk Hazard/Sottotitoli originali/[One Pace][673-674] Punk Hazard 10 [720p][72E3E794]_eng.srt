00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,180

{\an8}I won't let anyone take my freedom.

{\an8}Marines!

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,240
Please listen to my request...  Please find our children!

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,140
There was an incident three years ago when our children went missing.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,400
Search just one more time, please!

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,010
Surely you can see that it's absurd to say that children playing in our neighborhood actually died at sea!

51
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,950
We just can't believe it!

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,250
Please!  Search just one more time!

53
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,470
Re-open the investigation!

54
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,250
At least, please tell our story to Captain Tashigi!

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,790
We hear that she's a kind person who will listen to our story!

56
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,620
What a load of crap!

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you trying to insult us?!

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,680
I'll have you know that we're G-5 marines too!

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,180
You say that you doubt the Navy's reports?

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,640
Are you trying to complain
about the way we handle this jurisdiction?!

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,960
You're complaining far too much!

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,310
That's not what...

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,550
This is pointless.  Far too pointless!

64
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,690
Be reasonable!  Far too reasonable!

65
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,490
Your children died at sea!

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,370
Commodore, you go far too far!

Navy G-5 Squadron 06

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,110
{\an8}Yarisugi: Going too far

69
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:07,500
We've confirmed this with the head of G-5, Vice-Admiral Vergo far too many times.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,170
We've investigated it ten thousand times!

71
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,840
But...

72
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,760
If you keep on making a fuss about this,

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,660
then we'll charge you with obstruction of justice, massacre everyone, and torch the town!

74
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,420
Commodore, that's far too much.

75
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,850
Hmph, they want to talk to Tashigi-chan?

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,930
They're far too insolent!

77
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,620
Though, sometimes I wish
she was under my command.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,660
That'd be far too marvelous!

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,250
Your imagination's far too wild!

80
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,150
Unfortunately, that girl's in Squadron 01.

81
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,750
She works closely with Vice-Admiral Smoker.

82
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,780
Far too closely! { def: editor gone rogue on these lines! }

83
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,120
We don't have time to reopen investigations for a three year old incident.

84
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,750
Our free time is far too limited!

85
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,360
Far too limited!

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Damn turds.

87
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,000
You said too much!

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,450
Do you think they really
talked to the head, Vice-Admiral Vergo?

89
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,480
He really did save this island from pirates once.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,460
He was a perfect gentleman.  It's hard to imagine
that he's a member of a group of ruffians like G-5.

91
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,760
Did he really say that this was just a shipwreck?

92
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,750
They're alive!

93
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,520
They have to be alive!

94
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,990
{\an8}They must be out there somewhere!

95
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,040

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,580
My head's gonna split in two!

99
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,870
Usopp!  Hurry up and knock 'em out!

100
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm trying to!  But each time it's less effective!

101
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,330
Take these chains off!

102
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,870
The withdrawal symptoms
must be too strong this time!

103
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,070
Then what're we going to do?

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,410
We have to find some way to hold them down.

105
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,420
I'm counting on you, Sanji!

106
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,890
I'm Nami!

107
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,140
Oh, I forgot.

108
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,320
Damn.  You look so strong on the outside.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Well excuse me!

110
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,270
Misters!

111
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,340
Candy!  Give us candy!

112
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,940
Candy!  Candy!

113
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,920
My head hurts!

114
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,070
The pain!

115
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,980
Just give us some candy... it'll make it all better.

116
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,110
Candy.

117
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,760
Candy.

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,740
Candy.

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,080
Candy.

120
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,420
Give us candy!

121
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,970
Here they come!

122
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,620
Hey!  Hey!  I can attack them now, right?!

123
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,120
They're monsters!

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,970
No!

125
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,960
Idiot!  They're still kids!

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,480
But we can't avoid them forever!

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,140
It's Master!

128
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,110
Are you okay, children?

129
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,290
Now, let's go home.  Back to the lab.

130
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,480
It's too dangerous out here.

131
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,620
Master!

132
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,200
Master?!

133
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Central Lake

134
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,750
The Slime's getting angry!

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,490
Why now, all of a sudden?

136
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,740
Maybe it's because we blew up the mini-slimes?

137
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,030
Mayhaps they're like its children?  But we had no choice.

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,400
Huh, it's changing shape!

139
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,980
What could it be becoming?

140
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,670
What is that, a frog?

141
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,070
Isn't it a lizard?

142
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,150
Run!

143
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,780
Is there no end to the mini-slimes it can create?

144
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,150
No, it appears that
the big one on the other shore is shrinking.

145
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,230
So, the big one will eventually disappear?

146
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,450
Or maybe it's getting smaller because it's launching itself over here piece by piece?

147
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,160
We're done for if something that size
starts rampaging over here.

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,850
Yeah!  Cut it and it spews gas, burn it and it explodes.

149
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,320
And it'll be much much bigger.

150
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
The lab probably isn't even safe.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,240
What?!  Then we must make haste!

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,980
Momonosuke!

153
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,490
What're you two going to do?  I'm heading for the lab.

154
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,580
Then we have to go there too, you idiot!

155
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,230
Who're you calling an idiot?

156
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,810
You're too unreliable!

157
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,010
If you get separated from Kin'emon, then you'll get lost.

158
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,580
Do you expect us to search
the whole damn island for you?!

159
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,520
Zoro-san, Sanji-san, this is no time for fighting...

160
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,450
I'd like to see his sword techniques as well...

161
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,290
Let's go to the lab!

162
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,490
{\an8}Give us back Smokey, Caesar!

163
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,210
In Front of Caesar's Laboratory

164
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,210
{\an8}Give us back Tashigi-chan!

165
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,200
What's with this huge shutter?  We can't dent it.

166
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,140
Even a bazooka doesn't do anything.

167
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,980
Maybe there's a back door?

168
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,070
No good.  These shutters are on every side.

169
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,060
That gas bastard!

170
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,950
You don't think that this is a trap, do you?

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,320
What are you saying?  Don't be stupid.

172
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,250
Those creepy jellies aren't raining down anymore...

173
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,630
but if you pay attention,
you'll see they're merging and getting bigger.

174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,980
There's no chance of stealing a ship anymore.
They're blocking our path.

175
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,050
And they took our Snail Phones,
so there's no way to contact anyone.

176
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,430
What should we do?!

177
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,870
What's Caesar trying to do?

178
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,370
Who knows?  He doesn't tell me everything.

179
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,230
But since he's woken up his pet, Smiley, he might have an experiment in mind.

180
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,570
By the way, Vergo...

181
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,870
did you have a Hamburger for breakfast?

182
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,780
How did you know?  I love them.

183
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,790
You've got some on the side of your face.

184
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,400
I'd really like to see this experiment.

185
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Is everyone outside going to die?

186
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,330
Probably.  It'll be safe in the lab, though.

187
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,610
Hey, Vergo!

188
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,980
The marines outside are from G-5. 
They're your own men!

189
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,480
Are you planning to let them all die?

190
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,970
Yeah, that's about right.

191
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,140
What?!

192
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,690
But what a lovely collection of characters we have in this cage.

193
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,990
It's quite a sight.

194
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,700
Seeing the two of you in the same cage
really takes me back.

195
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,540
Oh yeah, you're right!
You captured me and Smoke-man back in Alabasta!

196
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,210
Shut the hell up.

197
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,630
Even at a time like this,
you don't care what's going on, do you?

198
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,760
Smoker-san, what do these feelings mean?
What should I do?

199
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,040
It seems your worst case scenario was right.

200
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:32,900
A member of G-5 would have to be
covering up the kidnappings by lying to the media.{cp589}

201
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,940
That means that Caesar used Vergo
to change the kidnapping reports into shipwrecks.

202
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,060
In other words,
the corruption comes from the very top of G-5.

203
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,150
You could say that's characteristic of G-5,
but it's a disgrace to the entire Navy!

204
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,840
How could you do this?!

205
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,930
What, is he some kind of bad guy?

206
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,640
It certainly appears to be so.

207
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,120
You shouldn't feel bad for not realizing it.

208
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,660
It isn't like Vergo actually betrayed the Marines...

209
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,990
since he was really a pirate the entire time.

210
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,400
A pirate... What?!

211
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,170
That's right.  Before he was famous,
he joined the Navy on Joker's orders.

212
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,530
He's slipped by unnoticed for fifteen years,
slowly gaining in rank.

213
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,680
Joker has no other Marine
more useful and trustworthy than him.

214
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,510
Vergo's been a member of Joker's crew
from the very start.

215
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,930
How could...

216
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,420
Joker... Wasn't that
the name of that broker from the underworld?

217
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,150
It's pathetic that I couldn't smell this rat.

218
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't be so hard on yourself.

219
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,990
I prefer to think that the rat deserves admiration
when it evades the great White Hunter, Smoker-kun.

220
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,050
I had to be very careful
ever since you transferred in from HQ.

221
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,590
It feels good now that I don't have to worry
about you anymore.

222
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,630
And even if my true nature was revealed,
I have a plan to handle it.

223
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,820
You must know why
I'm not worried about telling you all this, don't you?

224
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,730
Vice-Admiral Smoker and Captain Tashigi...

225
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,890
I'm going to shut your mouths
by making sure that you die here.

226
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,860
Caesar will take care of my subordinates outside.

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,250
It must be done.  This is important turf for Joker.

228
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,630
We cannot allow anyone to return alive
once they've figured out what's happening here.

229
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,430
As always,
we'll be able to make it look like an accident.

230
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,180
Vergo!

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,170
Hey, Traf.  Who's this Joker?

232
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,840
I used to be part of his crew as well.

233
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,050
That's how I know Vergo.

234
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,340
Joker is merely his title as an underworld broker.

235
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,530
You already know him, quite well.

236
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,960
What are you talking about?

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,210
He's one of the seven world-famous pirates.

238
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,640
A member of the World Government sanctioned Seven Warlords of the Sea.

239
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,720
Donquixote Doflamingo.

240
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,150
Master!

241
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,000
So...

242
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,360
you're the one who kidnapped these kids?!

243
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,960
What's he doing here?
Did Luffy and the others go the wrong way?

244
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,480
You've done something terrible.

245
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,700
Terrible?

246
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,730
Why did you take them away?

247
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,320
Can't you see that the children are suffering?

248
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,200
What?!

249
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,600
Hey, don't be an idiot!  Cut it out, Nami!

250
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,580
And whose fault is it that they're suffering?!

251
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,790
Stop it!  Didn't Law say he was
a Logia user with a bounty of 300 million?

252
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,310
What drugs have you
been giving to these young children?

253
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,490
All of them really want to go home!
Their parents must be searching for them too!

254
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,260
We're definitely going to
take the children away from this place!

255
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,070
They don't look like they want to go home.

256
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,100
Master!

257
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,750
Hold on!

258
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,780
Master!

259
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,820
Hey, wait!

260
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,020
Don't go!  You don't want
to go back to the laboratory, do you?!

261
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,930
Get out of my way!

262
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,910
Usopp!

263
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,390
That's right.  Come on home, children.

264
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,580
Please, stop!

265
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,990
You can't go to him!

266
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,650
Don't you want to go home?!

267
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,040
Don't touch me!

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,160
Cockroach!

269
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,190
Get away from me, cockroach!

270
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,190
Nami, are you alright?!

271
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,300
Y-Yeah.

272
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Don't get cocky, you bastard!

273
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,730
No, Usopp!

274
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,610
Let go of me!  We've got to use force to stop them.  It's the only way!

275
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,880
They're hallucinating!  He just called you a cockroach!

276
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,130
But...

277
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,560
these children are victims!

278
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,730
They haven't done anything wrong!

279
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,450
Take these chains off me!

280
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,470
It hurts!

281
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,190
But if we don't do something...

282
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,720
these kids will kill us!

283
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,070
Then direct that anger...

284
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,510
at him!

285
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,910
Take them off!

286
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,870
Take these chains off me!

287
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,460
You've got to be kidding!

288
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,780
They broke their chains?!

289
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,230
Magnificent!  How strong you have become!

290
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,630
That little...

291
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,070
Candy.

292
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,700
Master.

293
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,540
Please...

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,960
Just you wait, damn gas bastard!

295
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,540
The most effective thing against gas would be...

296
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
Deadly...

297
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,640
Fire Bird Star!

298
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,660
Stay back, kids!

299
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,340
Were you expecting me to explode?

300
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,540
So you know that I have gas powers.

301
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,500
But you see,
I can extinguish fire before it touches me!

302
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,870
Poison gas isn't the only kind of gas there is.

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,830
Air itself is a gas as well.

304
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,990
So that means that I can control the air around me.

305
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,110
Remove the oxygen and all flame dies out...

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,860
and you become unable to breathe!

307
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,080
Like so!

308
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,220
Usopp!

309
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,330
Black Ball...

310
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,840
Thundercloud...

311
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,310
Master.

312
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,300
C-Candy.

313
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,080
Candy.

314
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,190
Did I hear you say that
you think Straw Hat missed me?

315
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,210
As a matter of fact, we did meet!

316
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,780
I suffocated him and the other two!

317
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,230
Candy!

318
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,080
Now!

319
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
Master!

320
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,210
Gimme!  Gimme!

321
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,070
Children.  Only good kids
who return to the laboratory get candy.

322
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,090
We'll be good!  We'll be good kids!

323
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,440
Then you can be patient for a little longer, can you not?

324
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,910
Very well, but first...

325
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,570
these demons took you away
and made your disease worse.

326
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,630
Exterminate them!

327
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,040
Take those big pipes...

328
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,360
and smash their heads in!

329
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,270
Yes.

330
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,730
Stop... it.

331
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,070
Head... spinning...

332
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,040
Caesar!

333
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,970
Brownie!

334
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,940
His name is Brownbeard!

335
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,580
Straw Hat Pirates!

336
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,720
I see now!

337
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,250
Who are you again?

338
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,990
Oh, I remember!
My powerful subordinate, Brownbeard!

339
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,500
Did you forget that I even existed?!

340
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,970
Of course not!

341
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,840
What happened to you?

342
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,640
It looks like you were badly burned. It's painful just to look at you.

343
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,710
You were the one who ordered them to do this to me!

344
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,750
Brownbeard?{Copy-paste from 592}

345
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,530
You're on the hit list as well.

346
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,560
He's an idiot so he's easy to use,
but he has become a burden.

347
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,420
We don't need him anymore.

348
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,640
Kill him.{End copy-paste from 592}

349
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,410
The Cool Brothers, am I right?

350
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,960
So that's why you were burned!

351
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,170
I trusted you!

352
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,780
You shouldn't be so upset.

353
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,440
You survived an attack from the Cool Brothers.

354
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,940
You're quite lucky, really!

355
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,490
Silence!

356
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
Caesar!

357
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,870
Children!  It's dangerous here!

358
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,870
Get aboard the gas balloon outside!

359
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,470
Let's get away from this place!

360
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,670
Wait!  Don't go with him!

361
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,870
Caesar!

362
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,620
The fact that you deceived me doesn't really matter.

363
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,390
I... don't care.

364
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,440
But you will return my crew to me!

365
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,470
I will not let them suffer the same fate that I did!

366
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,440
Imbecile!  You have no crew!

367
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,150
All of them, including you,
belong to me now, remember?

368
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,820
How long are you gonna keep pretending that you're a captain?

369
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,660
You're the most pathetic pirate scum
in the New World!

370
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,040
Hey, Nami!  We've gotta chase after the kids.

371
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,750
Yes.

372
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,100
They will continue to obey me,
believing that I am their god of salvation!

373
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,630
They're just too stupid to realize...

374
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,680
that they're merely being kept alive
so I can use them as human guinea pigs!

375
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,390
You filth!

376
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,720
Gastanet.

377
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,630
Brownbeard?!

378
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,830
What happened?!

379
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,600
Gastanet!

380
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,580
Master.

381
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,750
Hey, where did Master go?

382
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,840
Caesar speaking.

383
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,180
I have successfully retrieved the children.

384
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,900
Has Smiley's food been prepared?

385
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,790
All the preparations you ordered us to perform have been carried out, Master.

386
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,760
and the Surveillance Snails are outside, ready to go.

387
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:08,360
So we can begin the live broadcast
of our fun experiment as soon as Smiley arrives?

388
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,460
Indeed.

389
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,570
Good.  Connect me to all receivers.

390
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,360
Understood.

391
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,590
Distinguished underworld brokers from all over the world...

392
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,130
Pardon the abruptness of this experiment,

393
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,740
but you are lucky to get to see this.

394
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,800
The gas weapon I am about to show you...

395
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,030
is even more effective
than the one from four years ago,

396
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,410
and it's an item that the trash
from the World Government could never produce.

397
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,700
Uninvited guests
wandered onto my island earlier today...

398
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,160
and I will be performing this experiment on them.

399
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,750
Conquest.  War.  Dominion.

400
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,770
This weapon has many possible uses.

401
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,710
If it is to your liking, shall we make a deal?

402
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,000
Are you interested
in this weapon of mass destruction?

403
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,520
Nah.

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,540
But... it can't hurt to see it in action.
