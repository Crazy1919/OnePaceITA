Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

So many obstacles are already behind us!

Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,040
Always step up!

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,940
Fly over the waves!

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,510
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,750
Now let's head for the future!

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:31,150
We drift forward, riding the waves,

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,390
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,630
all under this flag...

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,770
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,300
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,940
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,840
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,780
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,470
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,750
So many obstacles are already behind us!

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,910
Now let's keep moving forward!

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
Always look up!

38
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,600
Keep your head held high!

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,980
Always step up!

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,830
Fly over the waves!

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,540
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,020
Now let's head for the future!

{\an5}The Arrival of the Mysterious Man and

44
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,940
The gas didn't work at all?!

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,980
This protective suit was made by Vegapunk, and in fact...

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,080
...it's way beyond Caesar's ability.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,470
Caesar knew that, that's why...

48
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,170
All of you, just run!

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,610
The protective suit won't help!

50
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,400
Take it off and run to the lab now!

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,980
And that's how they all got petrified.

52
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,950
--Let's get going!
--Yeah!

53
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,620
Those who got petrified are still alive!

54
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,480
They're just in a state of apparent death
paralyzed in the shell.

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,800
Yeah, but after half a day,
the poison will spread and kill them.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,620
We have to find them
and break the shell before that!

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,520
Thank you...

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,700
...for allowing us to enter the island.

59
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,350
I'll never forget your name.

60
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,520
I can save my people's lives!

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,670
I promise I'll come 
back to turn myself in!

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,260
This is the only exit anyway.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,580
Just go!

64
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,880
Okay!

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,440
What should we do with these?

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Are they pirates?

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,610
I don't know. It's just creepy.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,170
Isn't that somebody's head?!

69
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,840
Huh? Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Y-You were right!

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,930
Heads are...

72
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,460
flying toward us!

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,650
That guy is...

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,990
D-Doflamingo!

75
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,560
Why is he here?!

76
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,970
The Conqueror's Haki!?

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,560
Why did you do that?!

78
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,180
They're not here.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,650
The ship is gone.

80
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,420
You're a Warlord!
Why are you attacking the Navy?!

81
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,420
I know some pirates were 
here little while ago.

82
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,720
Where did they go?

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,480
How dare you do that to our colleagues!

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,860
Don't do it!

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,830
I can't move my fingers.

86
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,760
Law is different...

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,410
but Straw Hat is just an ordinary pirate.

88
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,640
Don't!

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,180
Where did they go, you bastards?!

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,900
Stop messing with my soldiers!

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,280
Tell me where those shitheads went.

92
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,770
I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.

93
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,260
Well, I don't know,

94
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,160
Joker.

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,530
We could've caught them
but we let them get away.

96
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,000
So they're gone then!?

97
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,670
But you... I think you know too much.

98
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,560
Smo-yan!

99
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,960
Smo-yan!

100
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,400
Vice Admiral Smo!!

101
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,930
No, Brook! It's not a "little lamb"!

102
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,620
It's the Mini-Merry #2!

103
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,020
You're the eighth person to ask me that.

104
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,490
Like I told the rest,

105
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,910
I got out to the sea through 
a channel in the lab

106
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,680
and retrieved the Mini-Merry #2.

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,810
which had been docked
at the entrance to the island.

108
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,900
I see, I see.

109
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,990
So that little lamb 
was okay. That's good!

110
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,770
Nami, where are we going next?

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,270
Hold on.

112
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,030
The next destination is already set.

113
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,900
It's Dressrosa.

114
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,800
D-Dressrosa?!

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,170
Do you know the place?

116
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,920
Th-That's exactly where we...
I mean, I want to go!

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,310
You need to go there, too?!

118
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,780
Uh-huh, I think so!

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,100
The current is shifting?!

120
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,920
A slope?!

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,820
Yee-ha!

122
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,450
It's fast! The ship's going fast!

123
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,090
Look out for rock reefs!

124
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,320
It's a sea slope. It's not uncommon.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,550
It is uncommon!

126
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,200
We don't have to go against the current.

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,880
The needle in the middle

128
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,100
on your Log Pose must be 
pointing toward Dressrosa.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,870
But don't try to go straight.
Take a detour.

130
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,820
Come to think of it,

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,890
you were talking on the Transponder Snail earlier.

132
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,800
Who were you talking to?

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,980
That was Doflamingo.

134
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,230
Doflamingo?! The Warlord?!

135
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,870
I've heard he's the most evil one!

136
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,000
The plan is already in action.

137
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,290
What plan?

138
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,460
Yeah, tell us about the plan!
Get together, everybody!

139
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,230
We formed an alliance
to take down one of the Four Emperors?!

140
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,570
The Four Emperors, huh?
It's great!

141
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,780
No, it's not!

142
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,800
Wait, wait! Let's calm down, everybody!

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,610
Luffy, tell them about the alliance.

144
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,060
Okay! We and Tra-guy's pirate group
formed an alliance!

145
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,090
Let's be nice to each other!

146
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,880
Does anybody wanna oppose this?!

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,750
--I do!
--I do!

148
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,590
Does it make any difference?

149
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,290
Luffy's mind is already set, isn't it?

150
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,700
Thank you.

151
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,920
But I have to warn you.

152
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,950
There may be a slight difference between

153
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,960
how you define "alliance" and how Luffy defines it.

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,500
Be careful.

155
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,050
That's why Luffy kept saying "kidnap"...

156
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,640
which was so out of character for him.

157
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,070
If he had just come to me
with that strange sheep

158
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,010
and asked me to cook it, I
wouldn't know what to do.

159
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,570
You bastards.
You're not gonna get away with this.

160
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,170
Extraordinarily big names 
will hunt you down!

161
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,780
Idiots!

162
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,550
Realize how stupid you are! Go to hell!

163
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey, Sanji! I was in the 
middle of his treatment!

164
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,350
Wait until I finish it.

165
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,140
Really?!

166
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,190
I asked you guys to kidnap 
Caesar at Punk Hazard.

167
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,510
Meanwhile, I destroyed 
the machine which was

168
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,850
manufacturing a substance called SAD.

169
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,760
The great pirates in the New World
often have their own territory.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,300
They lead countless numbers of people
and reign like a syndicate.

171
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,020
It's nothing like what 
you've seen before.

172
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,010
One pirate group is never strong enough
even to see their captain's face.

173
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
But since it's an underground community,

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,490
they have to do their businesses secretly
to avoid the Navy.

175
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,530
And Doflamingo is the most trusted 
and powerful man among them.

176
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,370
His underground alias is Joker.

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,940
And Joker's most important 
business partner now is...

178
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,140
...one of the Four Emperors,
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.

179
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,420
Our target.

180
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,150
What?! K-Kaido?!

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,270
Kaido?!

182
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,900
What's the matter?

183
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,190
Never mind. Go on.

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,730
Why is there a dragon here?!
Where did Momonosuke go?!

185
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,020
That's him.

186
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,290
Kaido of the Four Emperors.

187
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,940
In order to take him down,
we have to weaken his forces.

188
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,920
Kaido is buying a large amount 
of fruit from Joker now.

189
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,500
It's a Zoan-type, man-made,
devil fruit called SMILE.

190
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,050
M-Man-made?!

191
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,040
If such a thing exists,

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,890
the number of devil fruit
eaters will keep multiplying!

193
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,530
That's right.

194
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,040
Since it's man-made, however,

195
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,770
it seems like there are some risks involved.

196
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,470
But, in fact, Kaido has
more than 500 devil fruit

197
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,630
eaters in his pirate group.

198
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,420
Who doesn't wanna do this?! I don't!

199
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,960
--I don't!
--I don't!

200
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,870
Shut up.

201
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,560
But the devil fruit eaters
won't multiply anymore.

202
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,970
Really? Him?

203
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,850
Were you making a substance
for the man-made devil fruit?

204
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,640
How cool! SAD!

205
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,900
Don't praise him!

206
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,800
He just put Vegapunk's discovery 
of "lineage factor" into practice.

207
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,090
So Vegapunk is the smart one.

208
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,390
Shut up, you bastards!
Can you fools even make it?!

209
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,840
Joker is finished.

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,380
We're gonna go onto the next move.

211
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,700
There is a factory manufacturing SMILEs
somewhere on Dressrosa.

212
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,970
We should just find it and destroy it?

213
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,360
That's right.

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,890
However, he's a professional 
businessman.

215
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,650
I'm sure he'll retaliate.

216
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,960
Is that where you wanna go, Kin?

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,750
Indeed!

218
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,620
A comrade of mine is captured there!

219
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,110
Huh!?

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,010
--Stop it, please!
--Smo-yan's gonna die!

221
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,820
If you kill him,

222
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,590
who would lead misfits like us!?

223
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,620
Don't worry.

224
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,030
There is no way to find 
out who knows what.

225
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,730
That's why, Law,
Straw Hat, and you soldiers,

226
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm gonna kill you all!

227
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,070
Stop!

228
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,080
Whoa-whoa.

229
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,900
Excuse me, young man.

230
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,020
Could you step aside?

231
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,660
What!?

232
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,400
He is my...

233
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,810
friend.

234
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,280
Is that the former admiral - Aokiji?!

235
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,000
Young Master!

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,160
Young Master-sama!

237
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,470
T-Thank god-dasuyan!

238
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,070
He didn't get frozen to the bone!

239
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,020
Young Master-sama!

240
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,740
Smo-yan!

241
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,710
I'm not interested in fighting you.

242
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,540
But if I can't silence that guy,

243
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,920
I have to change my plan.

244
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,340
Can I ask you something?

245
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,600
You, now...

246
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,960
where do you stand, Kuzan?!

247
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,990
Your reputation is sullied.

248
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,670
Hey, treat him already!

249
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,590
Y-Yes, sir!

250
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,330
The face of a mere wanderer...

251
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,420
and that of a man with determination...

252
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,330
they're quite different.

253
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,570
I never thought that the World 
Government was almighty.

254
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,800
There are things I can do
without belonging to the Navy.

255
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,010
There are things I can see now
because I'm not part of the Navy.

256
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,480
I was dead for a moment.

257
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,690
Maybe I was fated to come here.

258
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,370
What brought you here?

259
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,720
I came here to see you.

260
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,740
How did you know that I'd be here?

261
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,550
Don't tell me...

262
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,470
you have something to do with
the underground community now?

263
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
T-The former admiral has
something to do with...

264
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,340
If you're done with the 
treatment, go away!

265
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,850
I'm still me, Smoker.

266
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,250
Then I have no qualms.

267
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,090
Anyway, you guys should 
keep an eye on Doflamingo.

268
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,380
He's a Warlord and the 
king of Dressrosa.

269
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,920
He's an unusual pirate in many ways

270
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,310
but not like the Snake Princess of the Kuja.

271
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,450
Tell Sakazuki to get the 
admirals into action.

272
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,370
In the worst-case scenario,
things could go very wrong, very quickly,

273
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,360
and it would become the most 
serious matter Sakazuki faced

274
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,350
since taking over Navy HQ.

275
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,620
I've warned you.

276
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
Hey, guys!

277
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,860
You have to keep this...

278
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,370
I mean... you know.

279
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
What was it?

280
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,610
I forgot. Who cares.

281
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,810
It's a secret that we met you, got it!

282
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,880
That night, out at sea

283
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,420
It's already late! No one has come!

284
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,690
Yes, sir! I didn't see anybody!

285
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,870
Uh-huh. Good job!

286
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,940
Thank you, sir!

287
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,180
Hey, do you think they
can still find us?

288
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,240
How many people are looking for us?!
Tens of thousands?

289
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,710
I can't stop worrying
since I heard you blackmailed Doflamingo!

290
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,860
Me, neither, you fool!

291
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,420
Kin gave us armor and some helmets.
Just let it go!

292
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,560
Resign from the Warlords
or fight one of the Emperors.

293
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,070
Nobody can choose between those options.
He'll just come to kill us.

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm scared!

295
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,880
You bastard! Fight me squarely!

296
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,620
Stop!

297
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,170
I said it's a long story!

298
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,950
--Cut it out!
--Stop!

299
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,710
Come on! It's dangerous
to fight on the ship!

300
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,560
Oh, are you playing samurai?!
Fight, fight!

301
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,230
You should be ashamed of yourself!
The whole country was left heartbroken!

302
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,760
The grave of the Wano Kingdom's hero,
left plundered by a thief!

303
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,150
That was you!

304
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,520
I said I didn't do it!

305
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,070
You must have! You have
that legendary swordsman...

306
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,360
Ryuma's great sword Shusui on your belt!

307
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,710
Come on, come on! Fight, fight!
Just cut him already!

308
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,010
Who wants to eat a midnight snack?

309
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,860
Oh! What is it?!

310
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,300
Pizza.

311
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,550
"Pida"?

312
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,380
I don't know what that is
but if he cooked it, it should be good.

313
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,580
Did Momonosuke go to bed already?

314
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,250
He's taking a bath with Robin.

315
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,680
What?!

316
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,760
You haven't taken a bath
for days, have you?

317
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,230
Nope.

318
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,180
Did you get all warmed up?

319
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,060
Uh-huh. Not bad.

320
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,570
You came at just the right time!

321
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,140

Kin'emon-san, he needs a kimono.

322
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,370
What are you doing, you dirty brat!

323
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,200
It's not fair!

324
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,730
You're taking full advantage 
of being a child!

325
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,830
Just cut off your top-knot!

326
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,780
Hey! Why did you gang up on a child?!

327
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,760
N-No, it's not what you think, Nami-san!

328
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,010
M-Men are all...

329
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,130
I was scared, beautiful princess!

330
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,780
Beautiful princess?!
Don't be so honest!

331
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,210
You're such a lovely boy!

332
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,360
You sleep in our room, Momo-chan!

333
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,430
What?!

334
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,180
They'll let him in the girls' 
room - the secret garden?!

335
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,180
What?!

336
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,350
You're the worst, you brat!

337
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,700
Doflamingo! I know he's gonna make a raid in the darkness of the night!

338
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,580
Just bring it on! I mean, don't!

339
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,640
I-I can't sleep!

340
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,110
Calm all the way to the horizon!

341
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,000
The morning paper!

342
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,580
"Donquixote Doflamingo..."

343
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,560
"as a Warlord..."

344
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,980
"has resigned"!

345
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,720
"And abdicates the throne of Dressrosa"!?
What the hell!?

346
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,020
T-"Throne" means he was a king?!

347
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,720
A king?!

348
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,080
Then it must be a birds' kingdom!

349
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,300
When things go this well, 
it's kind of scary.

350
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,500
This is good. He had no choice.

351
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,260
By the way, why are our 
faces here as well?

352
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,260
"The Warlord - Trafalgar Law..."

353
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,280
"Forms an unusual alliance 
with the Straw Hats"?

354
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,820
"It is still unknown what the 
Government will do to Law." It says!

355
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,190
{\an8}There's so much going
on in today's paper!

356
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,070
Various places in the world

357
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,090
Doflamingo quits the Warlords and 
Law and Straw Hat join forces!

358
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,050
And these guys, too!

359
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,530
Captain Kid!

360
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,370
Scratchmen Apoo!

361
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,070
Basil Hawkins!

362
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,230
The Kid Pirates, the On Air Pirates,

363
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,030
and the Hawkins Pirates have
formed a pirate alliance, too?!

364
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,780
They were the troublemakers...

365
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,930
that everyone kept an eye
on for last two years...

366
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,190
and now they've joined
forces all at once!

367
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,520
Is something about to
happen in the New World?!

368
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,310
They formed an alliance, too, huh?

369
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,040
I wonder if they're thinking 
the same thing as us.

370
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,100
Forget about them.

371
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,280
We're gonna go on with the plan.

372
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,050
Focus on Doflamingo for now.

373
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,900
Now you know how important yesterday's 
negotiation was for him.

374
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,450
All we did was kidnap Caesar.

375
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,040
In contrast, seemingly overnight, he gave up...

376
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,280
his throne which he's had for ten years...

377
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,810
and the carte blanche given to him 
as a privilege of being a Warlord.

378
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,900
He did it just to get this 
guy back and that says a lot!

379
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,890
Dressrosa.
In response to Doflamingo's sudden abdication...

380
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,200
{\an8}King!

381
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,440
{\an8}Your Majesty!

382
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,440
The people have been thrown in confusion.

383
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:31,360
Ring, ring, ring... ring, ring, ring...

384
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,230
Ring, ring, ring...

385
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,650
clank.
