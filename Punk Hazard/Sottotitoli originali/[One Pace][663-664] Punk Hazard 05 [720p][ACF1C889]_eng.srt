1
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,790
Isn't that a warship?

2
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,140
Does that mean the Navy's here?

3
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,110
What?!  There wasn't anything here earlier!

4
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,570
There's somebody over there!

5
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,910
Huh?  Isn't that...

6
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,570
Hey!  Hey!

7
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,760
Imagine meeting you!  It's me!

8
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,130
Thanks for everything you've done for me!

9
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,440
Straw-Hatter...

10
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,280
He's...

11
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,660
the guy we met in the Human Shop on Sabaody.

12
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,720
Trafalgar Law.  But now, he's...

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,930
Right, Trafal... Traf!

14
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,880
That guy helped me escape
during the Whitebeard war.

15
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,780
And he even treated my injuries!

16
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,660
He did?

17
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,630
That's right!

18
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,770
He saved my life, just like Jinbe!

19
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,440
Hey!

20
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,540
I never thought I'd meet you here!

21
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,020
Really, thanks a lot for before!

22
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,880
Huh?

23
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,850
Where's the talking bear and those guys?

24
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,570
Bring Straw-Hatter over here! {Copy-paste from 487}

25
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm gonna take him away from this place!

26
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,870
Let me take care of him for now!

27
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,290
I'm a doctor! {End copy-paste from 487}

28
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,240
Where is Ace?! {Copy-paste from 491}

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,420
What'll happen if we just let him be?

30
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,160
Well, to put it bluntly...

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,310
Like I said when we came to this island,

32
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,930
if his wounds reopen, he'll probably die.{End copy-paste from 491}

33
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,420
Straw-Hatter will need complete rest
for another two weeks. {The script-search indicates that this scene is not from a previous episode.}

34
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,330
Understood.  Thanks for all you've done for us.

35
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,030
I'm impressed that you survived, Straw-Hatter.

36
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,430
But there is no need to feel indebted to me
for saving you back then.

37
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,300
I was just acting on a whim.

38
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,650
We are both pirates.  Don't forget that.

39
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,870
Guess you're right.

40
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,420
If we're both going for One Piece then that makes us enemies...

41
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,970
but I still owe a debt to a lot of people after what happened two years ago.

42
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,770
How lucky that I got to meet you
right after meeting Jinbe!

43
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,780
Really, thanks!

44
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,170
Hey!  There's a collapsed marine over there!

45
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Isn't... that...

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,320
Hey... Please save me, Trafalgar!

47
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,850
Smoker-san!

48
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,830
Don't tell me...

49
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,460
Smoker-san?!

50
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,300
Smokey!

51
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,240
The Navy?!

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,570
W-What?  Isn't that...

53
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,900
Hey, this isn't good, Luffy!  The Navy's here!

54
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,540
R-Right!

55
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,110
Captain-chan, what's wrong?

56
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,270
Smokey, are you alright?!

57
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,150
Smoker-san!

58
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,430
I knew it, it's Old Smokey and his group!
That sure takes me back!

59
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,190
There's a hole... in his...

60
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,950
Smoker-san!

61
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,300
In order to become a Warlord...{Copy-paste from 584}

62
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,500
he delivered the hearts
of one hundred pirates to Navy HQ!

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,180
He's completely deranged!{End copy-paste from 584}

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,810
How could you?!

65
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,270
How could you?!  How could you?!

66
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,270
How could you?!

67
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,490
Hey now, stop that.

68
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,500
I can't stand... such crudeness.

69
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,060
Tashigi-chan!

70
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,440
Dammit!  He got her again!

71
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,340
Even Smo-san is down!

72
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,490
What did he just do?!

73
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,700
You never learn, do you?

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't get so serious.

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,140
Tashigi-chan!

76
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,700
Luffy, hurry up!  We're in danger here!

77
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,210
Oh, right!

78
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,880
Hey, Traf!  I wanted to ask...

79
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,510
Go behind the laboratory.

80
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,980
You'll find what you're looking for there.

81
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,050
I'm sure we'll meet again.
We both have something we want back.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,700
He must mean me, thank goodness.

83
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,640
This is dangerous!  I'm a former pirate as well!

84
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,540
Alright, Luffy!  We've gotta get away from the Navy!

85
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,180
I wonder if Smokie's group will be alright?

86
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,680
Were they defeated by Traf?

87
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,960
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

88
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,030
Fire!

89
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,560
Stop it, this isn't the time!

90
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,220
Smo-san and Captain-chan are...

91
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,680
Even though it's deadly cold...

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,880
Mountain Outside of the Laboratory's Backdoor

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,880
- Sanji's Group -

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
I don't care!

95
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,740
I don't care about the samurai or the kids either!

96
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,650
Whaaaat?!

97
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,800
Isn't there a camera around here?!

98
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,560
I've gotta take some pictures
before I'm turned back into myself!

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,320
What kind of pictures?!

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,920
Also, stop having nosebleeds with other people's bodies!

101
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,660
Never mind that, Nami!

102
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,690
You shouldn't button up my Hawaiian shirt!

103
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,930
Are you alright?

104
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,390
You're freezing, right?
Hang in there just a little longer!

105
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,030
The swirly guy's being so nice, it's creeping me out!

106
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,520
What's going on?
Did your souls get swapped or something?

107
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,960
I didn't think it would be so cold in a human body.

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,600
Everyone, stop!

109
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,710
It's freezing...

110
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,250
It's hopeless... I can't go any further...

111
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,180
Me neither!

112
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm gonna freeze to death!

113
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,730
Dammit!  Taking them out of there without a plan was a bad idea!

114
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,870
Though, I'm not cold at all in this body.

115
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,350
Alright, I'll cut off my fur and give it to them.

116
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,370
Stop it!  That's my body!

117
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,950
So you say, but there aren't
any other warm coats around here.

118
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,790
I wonder if there's a mountain hut nearby?

119
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,480
Oh, a camera, a mirror...

120
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,630
and a s-shower!  A mountain hut would have those!

121
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,710
I'm gonna tie you up!

122
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,260
I see that I have no other choice!

123
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,660
Put a leaf on each of your heads!

124
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,270
Huh?!  This isn't the time for nonsense!

125
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,770
The kids are about to collapse from the cold!

126
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,320
Besides, there isn't a single plant on this island!

127
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,270
So there aren't any leaves!

128
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,240
Then use rocks or something else, it matters not.

129
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,960
Make haste!

130
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,580
Fine... It seems like you got some sort of plan here.

131
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,270
I'll find rocks for the kids!

132
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,260
We've done it.  So, what's up with this?

133
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,590
If this is just some silly superstition to make the cold go away,

134
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm gonna flatten you!

135
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
Alright!

136
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,130
Doron!

137
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,870
Whaaaaat?!

138
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,140
What's going on?!

139
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,500
We've got coats!  And shoes too!

140
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,350
How?!  What did he do?!

141
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,780
Gloves!

142
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,290
It's warm!

143
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,510
It's so warm!

144
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,850
The truth is, I consumed a rare kind of fruit,

145
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,490
and ever since, I have been able to use magic...

146
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,990
to change any object into a disguise!

147
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,430
I am not familiar with clothing from foreign lands, but will these do?

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,080
Though I must warn you that it's magic,
so the clothes will vanish if you remove them.

149
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,260
Yay, thank you!

150
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,540
Hmph, don't go overboard!

151
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,830
You've got Devil Fruit powers?

152
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,130
But you know...

153
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,690
If you could do this...

154
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,250
why didn't you do it right away?!

155
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,190
But... it's such a waste to conceal those breasts.

156
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,670
Idiot!

157
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,040
T-That itches...

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,220
That itches, it does!

159
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,760
You just can't bring yourself
to say that you're hurt or that it's cold, huh.

160
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,970
It's because I'm a warrior.

161
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,870
There they are!  Hey guys!

162
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,130
Heeeey!

163
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,380
Heeey!  Heeey!

164
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,210
What are they doing here?

165
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,500
Everyone, are you alright?

166
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,420
Oh, it's them!

167
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,810
It's Luffy's group!  Zoro!  Usopp!

168
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,970
Robin!  Brook!

169
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,300
I'm so glad you're here!

170
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,930
Why is that idiot cook so enthusiastic?

171
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,410
Is he trying to stay warm?

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,690
What's that?  It looks like a bunch of giant kids, but...

173
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,030
Huh?!  Hey!

174
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,290
What're you doing?!  Cut it out, Franky!

175
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,890
The Straw Hats' Shelter

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,720
We're here!  This place will do.

177
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
This equipment looks like the stuff in the laboratory.

178
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,980
But it's all in pieces.
Maybe there was some kind of big explosion.

179
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,710
Well, as long as they shields us from the blizzard,
it doesn't matter.

180
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,500
So, where do we start?

181
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,320
That's gonna leave a scar on my fragile body!

182
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,550
I'll take care of you right away!

183
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,800
Wait, Sanji-kun!  What are you doing with my body?!

184
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,100
I'm Chopper!

185
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,870
My lower half has returned to me, it has!

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,620
Legson... My hind-legs...

187
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,580
I told you, there's no such creature!

188
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,710
This is quite surreal.

189
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,020
What an odd fellow.

190
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,420
The skeleton...

191
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,470
Is talking!

192
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,810
Hey, do the tank thing!

193
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,170
Can you shoot another beam?

194
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,540
C'mon!

195
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,710
Shut up!

196
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,310
Who is he on the inside again?

197
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,890
Huh?  Are you sure?

198
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,790
You're having a hard time dealing with this, right?

199
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,720
Let's just calm down and talk this over, everyone.

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,850
Alright!  So, who turned into who?

201
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,620
First off, I'm Franky!

202
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,030
Don't come to me if you get hurt!

203
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,110
I'm Chopper!

204
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,070
If you get hurt, I'll treat your wounds!

205
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,700
I'm Nami.

206
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,910
I'd rather die than fire a beam!

207
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,170
And... We...

208
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,880
are Nami-san!

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,210
I've been waiting for this!

210
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,860
I think Nami is being too crude.

211
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,320
I won't do it again!
Please, don't hurt Nami-san any more!

212
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,840
Don't do it, Nami!  You'll kill yourself!

213
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,660
If you touch my body,
it'll cost you 200 thousand beli!

214
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,240
Peeping will cost you 100 thousand!

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
How will I survive?!

216
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,240
How long are you gonna keep laughing?!  Stop acting like this doesn't concern you!

217
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,530
So, to start at the beginning...

218
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,580
this is the samurai from the Wano Kingdom
that we've heard about.

219
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,670
The distress call that we received
was meant for the Crocotaur they called Boss.

220
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,500
It came from one of his subordinates.

221
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,560
This is because the samurai
was relentlessly attacking the centaurs.

222
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,410
However, I was only attempting to find and rescue
my missing son, Momonosuke.

223
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,670
I merely cut down those who stood in my way.

224
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,740
And behold!

225
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,330
All these children were imprisoned in that facility.

226
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,510
Momonosuke must be in there somewhere as well!

227
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,290
Yeah, we weren't the only children.

228
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,850
We hadn't even learned all of the new kids' names yet.

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,020
But the question now is,
what happened after they sent the distress call?

230
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,000
It was the man from earlier.

231
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,280
They referred to him
as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

232
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,590
What?!

233
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,620
Traf... is one of the Seven Warlords now?!

234
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,270
Indeed.
He joined their ranks during the past two years.

235
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,670
Before I knew it, I had been cut into three parts...

236
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,470
My head was thrown inside the facility.

237
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,720
My torso was simply abandoned.

238
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,720
My legs seem to have been used as monster bait.

239
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,860
I was running around, relying on my senses,
when I must have become stuck to something.

240
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,240
It was the back of the dragon's head.

241
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,190
Come to think of it, you were talking about that "Damn Warlord" earlier, right?

242
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,090
What?  It was just a pair of legs, right?  How could he have talked?

243
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,250
That's a good question.

244
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,990
Ah, that...

245
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,410
was me farting.

246
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,000
It is a talent I have possessed for a long time, it is.

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,170
You were farting?  That's disgusting!

248
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,500
Indeed it...

249
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Ah!  The place is starting to stink!

250
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,780
In any case, it is quite comical
how you're just legs and a head!

251
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,830
I, on the other hand,
encountered someone who was just a torso!

252
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,680
That obviously must be this guy's torso!

253
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,520
Oh, you're right!

254
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,190
Did you see it?!  Where?!

255
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,860
Where did you encounter my torso?!

256
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,870
Ummm, are you alright...
without a heart... Tashigi-chan?

257
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,590
Yes, strangely enough.

258
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,770
She's acting really shy.

259
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,850
The ships that were hidden near the laboratory...

260
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,420
had "CC" written on them.

261
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,240
Huh?  Really, Vice-Admiral Smoker?

262
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,270
Yeah.  Had they been the same ships that were used here in the past,

263
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,100
they should have said "PH" for Punk Hazard.

264
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:03,170
If we assume that someone above Law
is pulling his strings, and that "CC" is their initials...

265
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,620
then I have a hunch who it might be.

266
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,390
If he is on this island...

267
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,460
then it would explain quite a lot.

268
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Doctor Vegapunk's former associate...

269
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,010
the scientist...

270
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,940
Caesar Clown.

271
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,350
What do you think you were doing, Law?!

272
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,770
I should be the one to complain...

273
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,030
Caesar!

274
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,750
Something has been bothering me.

275
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,080
What?

276
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,940
If my memory serves me correctly...

277
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,320
a lot of children have been abducted in this region
over the last few years.

278
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,920
Abductions?

279
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,560
Yes.

280
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,020
But more importantly,
I can't get used to this new Captain-chan!

281
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,660
I can't help it.  Please try to deal with it!

282
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,680
Tashigi!  What are you talking about?

283
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,850
I haven't heard a damn thing about kids being snatched.

284
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,290
Please button your shirt, Smoker-san!

285
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,250
This "open" Captain-chan looks great, but she's horrifying on the inside!

286
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,670
Cram it!

287
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,620
There haven't been any reports from this region,
except for the occasional shipwreck.

288
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,520
But now that you mention it,
it does seem like a lot of kids die in this sea.

289
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,450
Yeah, that's right.  Right?

290
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,110
Right!

291
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,980
According to the communications division...

292
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,220
Oh, I don't have my glasses.

293
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,280
...many reports of kidnapped children have been made to G-5.

294
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:17,630
But in the newspaper, they're all announced as shipwrecks, piracy, or missing persons.

295
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,920
Of course, it's possible that
the reports were originally wrong and then corrected.

296
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,680
But... But it is also possible that...

297
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,390
Looks like you're hesitating, Tashigi.

298
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,370
If you have an opinion, then state it plainly!

299
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,240
Based on the number of children that we just saw...

300
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,270
you think that the reports of abduction were correct...

301
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,960
and the kidnapper could be on this island, right?

302
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,450
But in order for that to be true...

303
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:13,580
a member of G-5 would have to be
covering up the kidnappings by lying to the media.

304
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,350
So that means that
someone inside G-5 is helping the culprit?

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,480
Hey Smo-san!  I can't believe you're doubting us!

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,240
We may be the outcasts of the Navy,

307
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,080
but we still have our pride as Marines!

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
Shut the hell up!

309
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,980
She {/i1}is{/i0} scary!

310
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,130
Idiots like you aren't even worth suspecting!

311
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,330
What?

312
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,700
But don't let yourselves
have the wrong idea about the Navy, either.

313
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,220
All organizations contain multiple people,

314
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,270
so none of them can ever be perfect!

315
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,430
You'll overlook enemies if you let yourself think that the Navy's perfect!  Don't be deceived by appearances!

316
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,860
Yes Ma'am, Captain-chan!

317
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,220
You guys... Whatever.

318
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,190
I-I'm the captain!

319
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,480
Oh!  That's right!  We were deceived by appearances!

320
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,710
But Smoker-san, I'm still not entirely convinced.

321
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,110
Don't worry.
It's just a theory that we should keep in mind.

322
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,520
In any case,
my body and heart has been taken by Law.

323
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,250
We can't leave the island.

324
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,050
A third of you guys will go to the ship and report this.

325
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,310
What are you talking about, Vice-Admiral?

326
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,140
The ship's been sliced to pieces.

327
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,590
I said there were other ships, didn't I?

328
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,380
Go steal one.

329
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,290
Oh!  That was your plan!  You're a villain!

330
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,330
Be careful.

331
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,570
Before this situation gets any worse,
I'm gonna get my heart and body back...

332
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,650
and then I'll expose
the one who's pulling the strings on this island!

333
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,310
Former Vegapunk Lab

334
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,310
Laboratory #3

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,740
I finally got through to him.

336
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,100
We have permission to kill them all.

337
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:13,070
The Straw Hat Pirates, G-5, and Foxfire Kinemon.

338
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,000
No matter who dies on this island,
Joker can make it look like an accident at sea.

339
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,000
Capture as many of them as you can!

340
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,120
The more test subjects we have the better.

341
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,330
Yes, Master.

342
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,800
But if they make trouble for you,
then feel free to kill them with gas.

343
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,260
Where's Law?

344
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,290
He left the room a while ago.

345
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,500
No matter.

346
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,910
It seems that
one of them has a bounty of 400 million.

347
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,670
Don't push yourselves too hard.

348
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,610
In addition, the crew has bounties from 120 million down to fifty.

349
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,990
The total bounty for the Straw Hat Crew
is 800 million and fifty beli.

350
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,550
But for two years,
they've vanished off of the face of the planet.

351
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,420
Their bounties haven't changed in all that time.

352
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,900
Their actual strength might be higher than the numbers indicate.

353
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,510
You're always thorough with your research, Monet.

354
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,630
Master!

355
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,570
What happened to you?
Were you in the freezing cold without a coat?

356
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,630
It was stolen by pirates.

357
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,150
But more importantly,
they took Boss Brownbeard!

358
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,560
Please, save him!

359
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,610
Oh my, what a pity.

360
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,570
Don't worry about Brownbeard.  I'll definitely get him back.

361
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,360
Hurry now and go to the inner chamber.

362
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,500
You're very lucky.  I just finished a new medicine.

363
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,350
Something that will warm your body
and heal your wounds.

364
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,380
Really?  You've saved me.  Please help the others too!

365
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,530
Of course.  But first, you need to save yourself.

366
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,670
Thank you so much!  Thank you so much!

367
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,310
Hey!  What is this, Usopp?!

368
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,000
This is pretty super!

369
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,360
I give up.

370
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,740
Thanks, Usopp!

371
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,730
It detracts from Nami's beauty!

372
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,450
Stop complaining!
Without these, we'll get totally confused!

373
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,090
Brownbeard?

374
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,690
That's right.  Surely you've heard the name?

375
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,680
The whole world used to know me by that name!

376
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,870
Never heard of ya.

377
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,050
What the hell?!

378
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,900
What's happened?  Until recently,
you weren't willing to open your mouth...

379
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,650
but now we can't get you to shut up.

380
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,030
It's because you're going to be dead soon.

381
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,630
Law is going to come and save me.

382
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,270
I hate all the pirates from your generation, but Law is different.

383
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,270
What do you mean by "our generation"?

384
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,630
Don't you know?  Fool.

385
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,050
The eleven rookies worth over 100 million beli...

386
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,470
who met at the Sabaody Archipelago two years ago, and Blackbeard.

387
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,670
People are calling you "The Worst Generation".

388
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:06,150
You're problem children born into the gap between
two eras, forced to live in the chaos that entails.

389
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,400
After the death of Whitebeard, you stormed
into the New World and caused havoc on the seas.

390
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,380
Every time there's a major incident,
it's always someone from your generation.

391
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,920
Blackbeard, Kid, Law, Drake, Hawkins.

392
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,190
My very own Brownbeard Pirate Crew
was broken by Basil Hawkins!

393
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,880
Because of him, I lost my legs
and had to give up being a pirate.

394
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,650
We just barely managed
to escape with our lives and crawl to Punk Hazard.

395
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,670
Don't you know what this place is?

396
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,580
Hmm?

397
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,610
This place... This island...

398
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,710
It used to be filled with verdant forests,
overflowing with life.

399
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,030
This place?

400
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,780
I can't even imagine it.

401
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,670
The government scientist, Vegapunk,
used to conduct his experiments here.

402
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,040
He performed many experiments with weapons and medicine here.

403
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,110
They say that there were prisoners who never went to jail.

404
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,540
Instead, they were brought to this island
and used as human guinea pigs.

405
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,050
Then, four years ago, one of Vegapunk's
chemical weapon experiments went horribly wrong.

406
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,480
Two of the three labs were destroyed.

407
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,920
These are the ruins of one of those labs.

408
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,540
I see, the explosion must have been huge.

409
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,200
No wonder it's all torn up.

410
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,070
The explosion created a wave of burning heat that spread poison across the entire island.

411
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,790
It wiped out all natural life.

412
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:29,620
When that happened, the Government just abandoned the prisoners who were used as test subjects.

413
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,130
Fleeing the island, they sealed it off behind them!

414
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,720
The abandoned prisoners shut themselves
into the only lab that remained intact, Lab Three.

415
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,670
It was the only way that they could escape the poison gas that enveloped the island.

416
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:54,470
Due to the nerve gas, those who didn't die
almost always lost the ability to move their legs.

417
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,280
They had given up all hope.

418
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:06,410
But after a year,
our generous Master descended upon this island!

419
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,410
With his special power,
he cleansed the gas from the island.

420
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:20,610
And he used science to help the prisoners who couldn't walk and took them in as his subordinates!

421
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,590
Oh!  Master!

422
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,120
Master!

423
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,460
Master-san!

424
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:35,340
I arrived on the island a year after he did,
two years ago now.

425
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,250
There was still some remnants of the poison gas left.

426
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,770
Breathing it made you nauseous.

427
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,670
I didn't have the strength to live.

428
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,350
I had given up, thinking I was surely at my end.

429
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,190
That was when I saw them, the former prisoners who had lost their legs like me, and Master.

430
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,050
And just like them,
my life was also saved by Master's kindness.

431
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,730
If Vegapunk, who stole my comrades' legs, is a devil,

432
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,890
then Master is the kind-hearted god of salvation.

433
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,470
And then a few months ago,

434
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:41,220
another god of salvation, Trafalgar Law, a new member of the Seven Warlords, came to this island.

435
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,870
With his ability,
he gave legs to those of us who couldn't walk.

436
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,610
The legs of animals!

437
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,600
We, who thought we'd never walk again,
cried tears of joy.

438
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,730
What a great story!

439
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,470
I knew Traf was a great guy!

440
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,990
He saved me, too!

441
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,570
I didn't know Vegapunk was such a cruel man.

442
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,740
So the sheep-people we saw in the lab
were created by Law's powers.

443
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,340
I guess that explains the centaurs and the bird-lady too.

444
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,660
But wait, what about the dragon?

445
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,500
Oh, you saw the dragon?

446
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,220
That's an artificial creature that Vegapunk created to protect the island.

447
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,500
He can adapt to any environment.

448
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,000
One of the Celestial Dragons
took a liking to it and gave it a name,

449
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,070
but I forgot it.

450
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,800
If you see it again, just run away.  It's very violent.

451
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,930
Got it.

452
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,020
Even though I already ate it.

453
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,170
Anyway,
do you understand who's in charge of the island?

454
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,450
We won't allow anyone else to invade.

455
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,320
This island, Punk Hazard, belongs to our Master.

456
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,990
Rejoice!

457
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,680
Even now, Master is continuing his research for the benefit of the future of mankind.

458
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,310
He needs but a few human test subjects, and you get to become those subjects!

459
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,580
You can't escape!

460
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,490
Hmm?  What's happening?

461
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,770
Master!

462
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,990
Master!

463
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,420
The pain...

464
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,550
What...

465
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,370
What kind of medicine is this?

466
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,550
Master!

467
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,800
Master!

468
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,110
Let me out of here!

469
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,760
Try to endure it for a little while longer.

470
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,060
How do you feel now?

471
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,620
Nausea?  A cough?  That's fine.  Do you have a headache?

472
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,860
My head!  It's gonna split in two!

473
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,260
Oh, I see.

474
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,810
Huh?!  It wasn't Vegapunk?

475
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,510
Then, who was it, Smo-san?

476
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,560
Who was actually behind the giant explosion?

477
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,260
The one who made the weapon, and the one who blew it up,

478
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,780
was Caesar Clown.

479
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,950
At the time,
he was the number two of the science division,

480
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,500
but his methods were inhumane
and he was always challenging Vegapunk.

481
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,060
M-Master!

482
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,700
S-Save me!

483
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,890
What do you see?

484
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,820
Are there any hallucinations?

485
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,560
T-There's a giant snake in here!

486
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,370
Of course there isn't!

487
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,510
I guess that's enough.  Time to end your pain.

488
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:08,000
Vegapunk took the blame for the accident, but that's just because he was in charge.

489
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:15,400
Of course, it's a crime to develop a weapon of
mass destruction that covers an island in poison gas.

490
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,510
Once we figured out
the cause of the accident, we captured Caesar.

491
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,590
But his power proved to be too strong
and he escaped from the prisoner transport ship.

492
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,850
He's been in hiding ever since.

493
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:36,040
If he really is continuing his research on this island,
we've got to stop it quickly.

494
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,750
Before he commits another heinous crime!

495
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,490
I'll have to try again.

496
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,900
Another failure?

497
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,630
Failure?!  Watch your mouth!

498
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
Former Government Scientist

499
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
Bounty: 300 million beli

500
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
Master Caesar Clown

501
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,280
My experiments never fail.

502
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,740
The one four years ago wasn't a failure, either.

503
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,780
The World Government spouted such nonsense!

504
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,610
A failed experiment?

505
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,970
I showed how my weapon could kill an entire island!

506
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,260
Where's the failure in that?!

507
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,720
When it comes to killing enemies, I'm the best in the world.

508
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,260
And I've also tracked the progress
of every single one of the survivors, without fail!

509
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,680
Just you watch!  I'll show them
who the number one scientist in the world is!
