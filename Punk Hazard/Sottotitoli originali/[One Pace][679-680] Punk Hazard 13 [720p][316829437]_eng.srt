Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,310
So many obstacles are already behind us!

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,730
Now let's keep moving forward! Hands up!!

00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,620
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

16

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,820
Now let's keep moving forward!

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,400
Always look up!

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,590
Keep your head held high!

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,030
Always step up!

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,890
Fly over the waves!

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,480
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,720
Now let's head for the future!

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,100
We drift forward, riding the waves,

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,350
meeting people and saying goodbye, then doing it again,

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,590
all under this flag...

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,710
Pain I don't want to forget is kept in my heart.

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,240
There was a day when I softly carved it there.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,910
I won't let anyone take my freedom.

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,790
I grasp it tightly in my hands!

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,740
Now raise your hands up! Sing your dreams out loud.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,410
Always stand up! Raise our unyielding flag.

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,730
So many obstacles are already behind us!

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,890
Now let's keep moving forward!

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,250
Always look up!

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,560
Keep your head held high!

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,950
Always step up!

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,760
Fly over the waves!

40
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,470
Our dreams have been carefully joined together.

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,050
Now let's head for the future!

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:38,660
{\an5}G-5's Sacrifice and
the Betrayal of the Vice Admiral!

43
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,400
What's this?

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,860
What the hell is going on!?

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,190
Why aren't the G-5 marines by the main entrance?

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,310
Why can't I see any solidified bodies on the display?

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,890
Shinokuni's public experiment is nothing without them!

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,830
Where's the Straw Hats, Law, and Smoker? Didn't they all die properly?

49
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,480
Any thoughts, Vergo?

50
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,750
There's only one answer.

51
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,450
Those guys aren't in the cage anymore.

52
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,130
My G-5 marines are a bunch of violent idiots.

53
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:19,150
There's no way they'd be able to escape that gas on their own.

54
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,030
Meaning the Straw Hats escaped from the cage and then helped all the G-5 marines get away.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,230
What did you say!?

56
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,570
Master!

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,380
What's wrong?

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,490
The pirate Straw Hat Luffy is leading the whole enemy force

59
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:47,180
through Building-A's lobby, and they're pushing even further inside!

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,390
What!? They're inside!?

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,500
How can they have got through that solid shutter!?

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,440
How did they get out of the cage!?

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,490
We don't know!

64
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,320
Whatever the case, having Law free is not good.

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,590
Depending on his goal here I may have to kill him myself.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,660
It seems that both the Straw Hat crew and the marines are heading for the escape passage!

67
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,270
What should I do!?

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,400
It looks as though everyone's safe for now. That's a relief.

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,560
I don't know who gave me this piece of paper,

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,570
but did they actually mean that Luffy and the others could escape on their own?

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,460
I found out the drug's composition and I've got sedatives now, too.

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,340
Wait, which way should I go!?

73
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,420
What are my soldiers doing?

74
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,750
The guards in Building-A are responding to the attack!

75
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,840
The main force is making battle preparations at the post near the back of Building-B!

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,800
It's pretty clear that they just want to escape from this island,

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,360
in which case they'll be taking a straight path towards Building-R and Gate-66!

78
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,110
I'm not gonna let that happen! Close the walkway between Building-A and Building-B!

79
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,050
Closing this gate will isolate Building-A.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,810
Then we can destroy Building-A and let Shinokuni flood inside!

81
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,960
What? If we do that then our guards will also beâ€”

82
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,030
Never mind that, just do it!

83
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,680
Don't forget to deploy the Surveillance Transponder Snails!

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,540
But, Master...

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,020
The experiment needs a fresh start for the Brokers to see it properly.

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,980
They've yet to see the true extent of my scientific genius!

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,350
What're you going to do, Vergo?

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,740
You'd be lucky to catch even the small fry in a trap like that.

89
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,640
You're not the only one with something to lose if Law and Smoker aren't caught here, Caesar.

90
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,540
I can't allow you to act alone. I will cut every last one of them down.

91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,300
Huh? That's odd, my sword is gone.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,210
You're not a swordsman though, are you?

93
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,720
That's right, I'm not a swordsman.

94
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,490
Well then, I'll go and crush those little bastards.

95
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,000
Laboratory Building A

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,560
{\an8}You ain't getting through here, Straw Hat!

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,450
I am Machete Run, former pirate and gatekeeper of Building B!

98
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,840
In the name of Master Caesar, scientist of love!

99
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,630
You don't have animal legs! That's lame!

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,860
What kinda centaur are you anyway!?

101
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,850
Spider!

102
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,360
Outta my way!

103
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,650
Connecting Passage for Building A & B

104
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,650
{\an8}What a huge passage!

105
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,130
Law, what's that alarm sounding for?

106
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,830
It's the warning sound that this building's gate is closing and blocking the only path into Building B.

107
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,000
What!?

108
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,710
He's probably trying to lock us all out.

109
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,220
You should quickly move your men to the back.

110
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,700
I dunno what Trafalgar Law meant when he said we've got a two hour time limit,

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,410
but we're not gonna let you slip away from us, Straw Hats! You ain't goin' anywhere!

112
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,780
Don't even try it!

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,350
Get out of our way!

114
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,840
That's hot!

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,130
That's cold!

116
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,100
Nice! Three reliable swordsmen!

117
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,970
Sorry for asking you to carry us all, Brownbeard.

118
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,450
It's no bother, but why did you guys bring that dragon along?

119
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,520
We were only holding onto him since we thought that he could fly us away from the gas,

120
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,460
but he didn't fly at all.

121
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,310
Yeah, he can't fly right now because he's been injected with sedatives.

122
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,280
Still, bringing him into the laboratory may prove to be problematic.

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,710
Is he dangerous? He has a pretty cute face though.

124
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,980
We won't get this chance again! Take them out!

125
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,060
We'll get all the credit!

126
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm pretty sure I warned you guys about that!

127
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,010
C-Captain-chan!?

128
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,130
Oh, so you're a captain now are you, little miss look-alike?

129
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,540
You've still got no fighting spirit!

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,280
Fine, run on ahead.

131
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,770
G-5, we don't have time for fighting right now! Please, hurry to the passage at the back!

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:57,420
There's only one gate in this building and it's starting to close! Caesar's trying to lock us all in here!

133
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:03,710
If we don't head for that gate we'll all be trapped on Punk Hazard! Quickly, head for the back now!

134
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,150
T-This is bad! Let's get moving, do as Tashigi-chan says, guys!

135
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,760
Carry the wounded!

136
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,980
It's a straight line! Aim for the gate!

137
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
What a terrible thing to do.

138
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,460
Robin, where have you been?

139
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,850
Robin-chan!

140
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,520
I had to do a little favor for Luffy.

141
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,210
Anyway, did you hear what that marine said!? Keep going, Brownybeard! Move faster!

142
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,360
No way, I'm going flat out as it is!

143
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,230
I'm so sick of running!

144
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,820
What was that? A complaint?

145
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,590
It wasn't!

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,510
I'm not a samurai so I'll just say it!

147
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,560
I've had enough of this!

148
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey, why is Brownbeard with those pirates!?

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,610
Do you think that bastard might've betrayed Master!?

150
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,680
Master is our savior!

151
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,510
Just keep running! We're in trouble, too!

152
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,420
Let's move it, G-5!

153
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,700
It really is about to close!

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,820
Move it, move it!

155
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,620
Experiment cannon, standby!

156
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,050
Laboratory Exterior

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,330
Target is set as the outer wall of Building A, Third Laboratory!

158
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,290
Is that wall breaking!?

159
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,490
W-Wait, seriously!?

160
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,960
You're kidding!

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,420
Run! Just run!

162
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,290
Shut up!

163
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,540
Help me!

164
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,130
Hey!

165
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,000
Get through the gate!

166
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,330
Get inside or you're dead!

167
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,530
Alright, we made it!

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,750
So we have!

169
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,940
Just barely!

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,120
Huh!? Captain-chan just came flying in!

171
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,380
I'm glad you're safe, but why were you flying?

172
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,150
Please move aside! There're still marines out there!

173
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,060
You mustn't! It's already filled with gas!

174
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,340
Please move, the gate'll close soon!

175
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,330
You mustn't!

176
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,720
Let me go! They're still out there! Let me go!

177
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,720
The gate's almost closed already!

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,880
Smoker-san left them in my care! I will protect them all!

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,840
Now please move aside!

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,870
It's no use, Captain-chan, it's too late!

181
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:04,330
Well done, guys! We've safely received our precious captain from you!

182
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,350
What utter scum! Still, far too many of them survived!

183
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,690
I won't let them escape. Not a single one!

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,290
Connecting passage for buildings A & B

185
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,990
He's sacrificed the laboratory to let the gas inside.

186
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,400
Hey, pick up the pace!

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,820
You guys! When did all of you get on my back!? It's getting too heavy for me!

188
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm sorry, but you'll have to stick it out a little longer. There's no other choice.

189
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,320
We're...

190
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,180
really tired and we can't be bothered to run anymore.

191
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,740
That's a terrible reason! Get off me!

192
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,810
You are called Brownbeard, correct?

193
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,340
Forgive me, but I simply must rescue my son, Momonosuke, as soon as possible.

194
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,610
However, I've already done a lot of running and I can't actually be bothered to do any more.

195
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,850
Get off me you stupid bastards!

196
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,580
It's pretty hot with this coat on inside the laboratory.

197
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,510
Yeah, you can hang it over here.

198
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,990
Don't make yourselves at home on people's backs! If you're not hurt then you can run yourselves!

199
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm feeling a little peckish.

200
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,520
I never hunger, for I have the stomach of a samurai.

201
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,890
Brownbeard-san, do you have anything to eat?

202
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:59,820
Shut up! The minute we reach one of the soldiers' posts I'm gonna shake you all off my back!

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,350
Connecting passage for buildings A & B

204
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,510
Captain-chan, We've gotta get moving!

205
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,000
We thought Punk Hazard was locked down, but that guy was making weapons of mass destruction here!

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,310
We gotta act before the whole world's affected!

207
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,210
We've gotta get off the island and alert Navy Headquarters!

208
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,650
If we can't make it back alive to the main force then what did those guys just sacrifice their lives for!?

209
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,380
Let's go!

211
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,410
Wait a minute.

212
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,430
Something's on the ceiling!

213
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,180
What is that thing!?

214
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,650
I think it was with those Straw Hat guys earlier!

215
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,020
It looks like some kinda lizard!

216
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,040
I've heard stories about this. About how Punk Hazard has real dragons on it.

217
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,120
Doctor Vegapunk artificially created these mythical beasts to protect the island.

218
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,800
It didn't look so scary a minute ago!

219
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,600
He dodged!?

220
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,560
T-T-That's steel!

221
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,450
If you get bitten by jaws like that...

222
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,550
Everyone, get moving to Building B now!

223
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,420
It flies, breathes fire and chews steel!

224
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,640
What kinda monster is this!?

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,110
What happened?

226
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,220
It's gone.

227
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,160
It ran away?

228
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,150
Something spooked him.

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,320
Captain Tashigi, this is awesome!

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,090
Our strongest backup is here on Punk Hazard!

231
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,610
The Vice Admiral has come to save us!

232
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
Vergo!

233
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,530
Vice Admiral Smokey and Vice Admiral Vergo! The two heads of the G-5 are here!

234
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,690
We're gonna be invincible now!

235
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,240
No!

236
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,010
Alright, we're saved now!

237
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,630
Run! All of you, run away!

238
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,890
V-Vice Admiral Vergo, did those guys do something wrong?

239
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,180
Even if they needed a beating, getting hit by your Finger Gun can kill!

240
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,900
Welcome.

241
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,270
I've heard much about you, Commodore Smoker, it's nice to meet you.

242
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,110
My G-5 boys are as rough and stupid as they come, but once you get to know them

243
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,740
they're not as bad as the rest of the world says.

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,450
Before too long you'll come to think of them fondly.

245
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,970
Where's Vice Admiral Vergo?

246
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,040
Don't worry about it. Vice Admiral Vergo has to hurry back home from time to time.

247
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,540
His younger sister is pretty sick.

248
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,400
Are you guys really the Navy!?

249
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,980
I am sorry.

250
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,050
I'm entirely responsible for the actions of my subordinates.

251
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,600
Oh, is that right? Well then, you'd better take full responsibility right now!

252
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,570
Bitch!

253
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,360
Don't get carried away!

254
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,240
I understand. I'll make sure they do whatever is needed to make you happy.

255
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:35,450
Vice Admiral Vergo, regarding the reports of kidnapped children we spoke of the other day...

256
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,430
Yes, I investigated, but they appear to have simply been accidents at sea. The reports were incorrect.

257
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,440
Incorrect?

258
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,100
It's hard for any parent to accept the death of their child,

259
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,610
that's why they still cling to the idea of a kidnapping so they can continue to live in hope.

260
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,590
You'll come to understand that when you become a parent someday.

261
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,130
Is that really how it is?

262
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,070
Yes, that's really how it is.

263
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,120
Everyone, get back! He's not the man you used to know!

264
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,610
The whole damn time, this guyâ€”

265
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,340
Captain-chan!

266
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,940
Captain-chan!

267
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,390
This guy's an impostor!

268
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,410
Vergo-san would never do something like this to our Captain-chan!

269
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,300
Yeah! Is that a disguise!? Are you an ability user!?

270
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,820
Bastard, how dare you imitate Vice Admiral Vergo!

271
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:49,470
Vice Admiral Vergo even took lowlife marines like us under his wing, he's a man of humanity and justice!

272
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,400
Stop imitating him!

273
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,340
You're goin' down, you copycat bastard!

274
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,310
I can't even speak!

275
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,280
Please, just stop!

276
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,600
Help us, Smoker-san!

277
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,440
There's a lady...

278
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,870
Who's there?

279
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,630
...calling out to me!

280
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,380
One of the Straw Hats!

281
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,580
Why's a pirate helping us?

282
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,760
I could hear a lady's tears falling to the ground.

283
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,980
Building B Interior

284
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,400
Sanji's expression changed and then he just flew off!

285
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,890
I felt a strange presence suddenly appear back there. Just forget it.

286
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,740
Is that...

287
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,070
It's the dragon from earlier!

288
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,650
Wait, he looks a little different.

289
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,780
{The look in}His eyes!

290
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,150
Looks like his sedatives have worn off like I thought.

291
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,600
On top of that, he's one of the newer, smaller and more advanced types.

292
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,080
They're more agile and have tougher bodies.

293
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,710
Building B Central Staircase

294
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,710
{\an8}I'm gonna capture Caesar!

295
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,720
What about you?

296
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,630
I've got a score to settle with Vergo.

297
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,150
Will he be with Caesar?

298
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,940
I doubt it, now stay out of my way!

299
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,180
Dammit, get back here!

300
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,540
Caesar's Laboratory

301
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,880
What the hell is that Vergo bastard doing!?

302
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,500
The G-5 are a necessary part of my experiment!

303
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,650
There's no damn point if they aren't all killed by Shinokuni! That idiot!

304
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:45,100
Since it's come to this, block off the passage in front of the G-5 then let the gas flow in behind them!

305
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,420
But, Vergo is still in there.

306
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,970
You think I care about that idiot's life!? Do it now!

307
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,420
Building B 3rd floor
Near Biscuit Room

308
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,940
Biscuit Room is this way!

309
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,900
Let's go!

310
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,550
You ready?

311
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,280
No, I'm not! Can't you wait a minute!?

312
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,090
I've been running so damn fast I set the ground on fire!

313
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,420
But you, flying through the air on that fluffy cloud of smoke, that's gotta be cheating!

314
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,020
Alright, you ready?

315
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,450
Wait a moment! Hey, didn't I already say wait a minute!?

316
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,180
When I say "let's go" we'll go.

317
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,460
I've just gotta compose myself.

318
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,650
Hey! I haven't even said "let's go" yet!

319
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,150
You listening? Vergo is my enemy!

320
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:53,960
Yeah, I know. Caesar is mine! Keep your damn hands off him!

321
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,040
Ah, this one's mine!

322
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:09,840
You ain't gettin' away this time, Caesar!
