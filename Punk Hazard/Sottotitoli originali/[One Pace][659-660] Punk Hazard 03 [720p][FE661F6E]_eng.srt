1
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,160
Hey...

2
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,580
Are you really planning to cross this lake, Luffy?!

3
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,580
The Burning Lands

4
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,580
-Luffy's Side-

5
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,290
Yup.

6
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,090
And just how are you planning to cross this lake?!

7
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,840
Parts of it are on fire.  Others are frozen!

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,570
Then the water temperature might be fine.
And I am quite sweaty...

9
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,340
Shall we swim across?

10
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,220
Don't be absurd!

11
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,160
Me and Robin can't swim, you know.

12
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,610
You want to ride us across, don't you?!

13
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,730
Well, whatever I think...

14
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,860
If we don't cross the lake,
we'll be taking a huge detour.

15
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,790
Guess there's no choice.  I'll handle it!

16
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,410
Alright, let's do this!

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,160
{\an8}Fan Grass

18
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,800
What's this grass?

19
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,760
It's a boat!  That's amazing, Usopp!

20
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,810
And this fan grass will serve as oars!

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,300
You have all sorts of seeds, I see.

22
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,710
How wonderful.

23
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,600
The Boyn Islands were a treasure trove
of strange plants, after all!

24
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Whenever I entered a dangerous area, 
I managed to snag some convenient plants!

25
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,540
I survived on that island for two whole years,

26
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,370
so you could say that there's nothing I can't han-

27
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,010
Get aboard, Usopp!

28
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,000
You'll get left behind.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,250
Hey!  I was the one who made that!

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,130
Alright!

31
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,000
Cast off!

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,910
To the land of shaved ice!

33
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,360
Row, damn you!

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
The wind is so strong!

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
And it's a headwind, at that!

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,680
Of course.

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,520
The extreme temperature difference
on the island causes the wind to blow.

38
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,190
The water's boiling out here.

39
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,120
If we'd tried to swim, it would've been a disaster.

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,910
We're not really making much progress.

41
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,020
You have to row, dammit!

42
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,490
You won't get away.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,270
Wait, you bastards!

44
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,450
Look out!

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,870
It's the centaur from before!

46
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,110
Hey!  Did you decide to join my crew after all?

47
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,380
Did you just invite him again?!

48
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,930
Will you stop asking every freak we meet to join us?!

49
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,880
A horn?

50
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,090
Boss!

51
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,930
Boss?

52
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,510
That reminds me,

53
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,700
didn't the Snail Phone say...

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,120
It's freezing... Is that you, boss? {Copy-paste from 579. Man, they sure don't get tired of flashing back to this conversation, do they?}

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,390
The intruders are heading your way!  Please take care of them!

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,570
Something just appeared on the shore.

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,180
Is that his boss?

58
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,750
So the emergency transmission was from him?

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,860
In that case,
it would be silly for him to try to attack us!

60
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,960
One of them is carrying a sword.

61
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,160
Is that the...

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,140
samurai who cut down our comrades?

63
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,230
A volcanic eruption?!

64
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,270
Visiting this island...

65
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,870
makes me feel like Akainu and Aokiji are glaring at me!

66
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,790
Scary!

67
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,870
Let's just leave!

68
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,120
Fire, please.

69
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,010
A river!

70
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,040
Hey, that was amazing, Smokey!

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,530
Incredible!  How did you know
there was a river behind the ice, Smokey?!

72
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,400
You really are great, Smokey!

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,990
I didn't notice anything at all, Smokey!

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,560
It was obvious to anyone watching the water currents!

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,700
You lack basic observation.

76
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,670
Also, don't be so familiar!

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,540
But this creates a question.

78
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
It does.

79
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,080
The issue isn't that there's a river here...

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,880
We should be asking,
was the ice blocking this current natural...{ Btwb: "floes" is not a very common word, for me at least. Also, they looked more like ice bergs or masses of ice instead of detached sheets, which is what floes are, according to what I looked up. }

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,880
or was it placed intentionally?

82
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,890
You mean...

83
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,200
someone might have hidden it on purpose?

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,410
You're saying that someone might live
on this island, in this gas cloud?!

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,600
No way!  They'd have to wear masks all the time!

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,300
The voice we heard in the transmission definitely said the name of this island.

87
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,840
We must have heard wrong, Tashigi-chan!

88
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,550
Even Snail Phones would die in a place like this!

89
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,580
You got that right!

90
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,710
If you've got time to laugh, 
then you've got time to clear the next ice wall!{ Btwb: Note in case we stick with "floe". }

91
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,540
What the hell is that?!

92
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,890
A wall of ice!

93
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,460
If we crash into that, the entire ship will sink!

94
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,420
This is not good!

95
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,690
Smash it!

96
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,400
Fire!

97
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,660
The frozen lands - Inside the mysterious facility

98
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,660
-Nami's Group-

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,180
This way, children!

100
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,550
You better run if you wanna get out!

101
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,920
You sure are fired up, Chopper!

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,490
Of course I am!  Sanji gave me a mission...

103
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,980
to protect the children
and get them safely out of this building!

104
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,390
And I'm gonna do it!

105
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,870
I will complete my mission!

106
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,810
As the only man here, I must do my best!

107
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,750
But where should we go?

108
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,920
You should figure that out!

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
Sheesh!

110
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,780
Lady, are you alright?

111
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,070
Of course!

112
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,830
I can't even count the number of times I've been in situations crazier than this!

113
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,580
Just follow me and don't worry.

114
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,250
Sure!

115
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,560
Inside the mysterious facility - Biscuits Room

116
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,560
-Sanji's Group-

117
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,110
Super!

118
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,110
H-He's installed weapons all over his body!

119
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,010
It must be him!
The one who destroyed the door to the room!

120
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,870
You seem interested in my weapons.

121
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,510
Alright!  I'll show them to you as much as you want!

122
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,140
Load your guns with poison gas bullets!

123
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,040
There aren't any kids in the room anymore!

124
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,090
Don't hold back, riddle him with bullets!

125
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,640
In that case, let's remove your masks
so we can breathe the poison gas together!{ Btwb: Sanji's all about sharing! }

126
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,510
Damn you!

127
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,600
Don't be so anxious. { def: anxious? }

128
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,270
He got our masks!

129
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,780
Our air tanks too!

130
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,530
Don't fire the gas bullets! { def: way too late now, but shouldn't it be gas grenades? }{ Btwb: Mangarule has grenades, mangahere says shots, but they all work, really. }

131
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,950
What are they?!

132
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,750
Sheep?!

133
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,900
What're you doing?

134
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,690
This is unlike any man I have faced before! { def: intentionally not using gender neutral language for this guy }{ Btwb: Good call. Chauvinistic samurai is chauvinistic. }

135
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,170
Who could it be?!

136
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,550
I cannot seem to take him down!

137
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,970
Seriously, what are you talking about?{ Btwb: Looked up "what are you on about?", urban dictionary was the first hit. I don't find Franky to be quite that urban, but mostly I don't think our audiance would think this as normal. Also, I wouldn't be saying "again" if I first asked what he was doing and then went to ask what he means. }

138
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,970
I speak of my torso!

139
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,880
Huh?

140
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,230
Mysterious facility - Front Entrance

141
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,230
-Brook-

142
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,960
Whoa, hey wait!  What is this?!

143
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,740
W-W-Who are you, good sir?!

144
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,100
What happened to your head and legs?!

145
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,260
Scary!  Please say something!

146
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,260
Fire!  Fire!

147
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,950
We'll soon be finished travelling this river.

148
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,080
What lies ahead?

149
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,430
I have a hunch.

150
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,810
By any chance... might you be... a ghost?!

151
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,910
If that is the case, isn't this inappropriate?!

152
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,950
It's midday!

153
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,300
Haven't I always been good?

154
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,620
I just came ashore to make snowmen!

155
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,490
Ah, if you like, shall we make some together?

156
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,920
If we work together,
we might even be able to make a snow sculpt-

157
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,050
I was joking!

158
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,890
What is going on here?!

159
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,730
That man has no eyes,
so how is he able to attack so accurately?!

160
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,110
Though, come to think of it, I don't have eyes either!

161
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,590
Scary!  Strong!  Scary!

162
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,660
What has gotten into you?!

163
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,300
At least tell me why you're fighting me!

164
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,850
Nitouryuu?!

165
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,850
{\an8}Two-Sword Style { tlc: Did we always use hyphens for this? }{ def: we've been horribly inconsistent with sword styles, it's hyphenated about half the time. i don't really have a preference, if no one else has a preference i'll prolly drop it }

166
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,460
Please, stop this!

167
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,450
Scary!  Scary!

168
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,160
Creepy!

169
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,490
Master.

170
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,840
Did you catch the escaped prisoners?

171
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,430
No, I came to report on the G-5 ship.

172
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh, them?

173
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,800
The poison gas cloud didn't stop them...

174
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,680
and at the moment, the warship
is using its cannons to destroy the ice walls,{ Btwb: floes }

175
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,510
and they're slowly making their way inland.

176
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,720
Before long, they'll reach this laboratory!

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,070
Why? Why do they go to such lengths
to land on this island?

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Did they get tipped off in some way? {Literally "Do they have some sort of conviction?"... Rather vague, really, so I may have misinterpreted it.}{ def: went with a reinterpretation of the manga's line: "Do they have some kind of knowledge of what lies ahead?" }

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,890
Who is commanding the ship?

180
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,810
It's Vice-Admiral Smoker.

181
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,420
Smoker?!

182
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,320
Of all people... What a troublesome man!

183
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,210
Conceal the ships
that are docked at the main entrance!

184
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,140
Should we deal with them?

185
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Nobody is allowed to be here...

186
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,180
so make sure they don't see you!

187
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,670
Then what about you, Master?

188
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,250
Don't be absurd!  There's no way I could go out there! { def: maybe "leave this place"? }

189
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,010
But that leaves us with no way of stopping them!

190
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,970
Want me to go?

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,140
There's no gas here.

192
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,420
It's true!  I can't believe it!

193
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,690
Then why was there all that gas before?

194
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,600
It must be the work
of someone who doesn't want us here.

195
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,120
Is there really someone here?

196
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,550
Doctor Vegapunk's research facility.

197
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,400
Or rather, it used to be.

198
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,310
It's supposed to be abandoned,
an empty building devoid of people or equipment.

199
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
Who's been living here?

200
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,650
Hey!  Come out!

201
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,560
What's wrong?!  Are you scared of us?!

202
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,080
There's no need to be polite and ring the doorbell!

203
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,920
We can open the door in no time
if we just blast it with the ship's cannons, Smokey...

204
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,870
Uh, Smoker-san.

205
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,600
Hey, answer!

206
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,220
Open the door!

207
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,730
You listenin'?!  This island is off-limits!

208
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,120
Whoever you are, you're under arrest, you moron!

209
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,720
It's opening!

210
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,140
You finally understand your situation?
We are the Navy!

211
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,200
What business do you have at my vacation home...

212
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,370
White Hunter? {So previously I've translated Law's whole thing with appending "-ya" to the end of people's names as him ending it with "-er"... This obviously does not work here, so... SPEECH-QUIRK IGNORED FOR THE TIME BEING.}

213
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,670
This is impossible!

214
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,680
That man...

215
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,250
Used to be a rookie with a 440 million Beli bounty...

216
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,670
but now...

217
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,310
alongside Hawk-Eye Mihawk...

218
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,430
the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock...

219
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,570
Donquixote Doflamingo and the rest...

220
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,480
he is one of the Government-authorized pirates... the Seven Warlords of the Sea!{ Btwb: Either needs to be possessive (Government's authorized) or needs to be hypenated (government-authorized). }

221
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,440
Trafalgar Law.

222
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,410
Let's get out of here, Smoker-san!

223
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,040
I don't want anything to do with that guy!

224
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
You know, right?

225
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,590
In order to become a Warlord...

226
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,110
he delivered the hearts
of one hundred pirates to Navy HQ!

227
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,940
He's completely deranged!

228
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,730
He gives me the creeps!

229
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,200
Why are you here?

230
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,370
This island is forbidden
to both pirates and the Government alike, Law!

231
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,830
I could ask you the same thing.

232
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,100
Inside Dr. Vegapunk's old laboratory

233
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,100
-Nami's Group-

234
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,440
Daddy!  Mommy!

235
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,460
Hey, you said you weren't sick anymore, right?

236
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,640
Yeah.

237
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,180
What disease did you have?

238
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,410
None of you show any symptoms.

239
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,390
I don't know.  They just said "You have a disease",
and "You'll be fine after a year".

240
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,460
A disease that passes after a year?

241
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah.

242
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:29,840
Mommy and Daddy asked some people to cure me
and then those people took me here.

243
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,410
So, your parents told you to come here?

244
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,630
No.

245
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,240
It was those people,
they told me all of this outside of my house...

246
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,060
and then I was taken here.

247
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,690
They said that I could've infected Mommy and Daddy.

248
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,490
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

249
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,180
Was it like that for the rest of you?

250
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,790
Yeah.

251
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,360
Me too.

252
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,500
Yeah, right!  This definitely sounds like kidnapping!

253
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,900
So you were brought here by strangers,
and didn't even talk to your parents first?

254
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,750
You know what this sounds like?

255
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,470
You were suffering from a really terrible illness!

256
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,240
Are you a complete moron?!

257
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,890
Is all this running too much for any of you?

258
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,260
I'll carry anyone who's worn out.

259
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,990
But you've already been here more than a year, right?

260
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,080
Chopper, have a look at them after this.
Then we'll know for sure.

261
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,630
Sure.  Will do.

262
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,310
Nami!

263
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,770
Out of the way!

264
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,940
One more time!

265
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,610
It's open.

266
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,320
You've gotten really powerful.

267
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,320
Amazing!

268
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,550
You're so cool, Raccoon Dog-chan!

269
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,250
Wait, I'm not a raccoon dog!

270
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,200
But you just acted like one.

271
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,950
You're right!

272
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,730
It's freezing!

273
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,990
Chopper, lend me your fur coat!

274
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,600
Alright...

275
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,790
Wait, I can't take it off!

276
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,750
What is this place?  Are we outside?

277
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,460
Or maybe a freezer?

278
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,850
It's so dark, I can't really tell...

279
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,640
This climate's perfect for me!

280
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,340
It's so dark, I can't...

281
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,730
Oh, now I see it!

282
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,980
There's a door at the other end!

283
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,060
You're right!

284
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,550
Let's keep going!  This isn't a dead end!

285
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,680
Alright!

286
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,770
Lady!  I don't wanna go in there!  It's scary!

287
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,570
What?!

288
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
What's wrong, everyone?

289
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,060
Hurry up!  They're still after us!

290
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,880
They took me through here
when I first came to this island!

291
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,290
Really?  Then it must lead to the exit!

292
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,310
It's pretty cold, but try to bear it everyone!

293
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,030
Hurry!

294
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,480
That's not the problem!

295
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,670
I mean...

296
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,550
around us...

297
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,640
Around us?

298
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,560
There's something...

299
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,030
inside the walls.

300
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,190
I'm scared of this place
because there are frozen people here!

301
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,400
Huh?!  What is all this?!

302
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,080
Frozen... corpses?!

303
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,120
They're above us too!

304
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,040
And under us!

305
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,590
Noooooo!

306
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,100
Ah!  Please, wait!  Don't leave us!

307
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,990
Well, that takes care of that.

308
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,150
Inside the laboratory ・ Biscuits Room

309
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,150
-Sanji's Group-

310
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,400
Hey!

311
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,150
You've blocked their way.  That's more than enough.

312
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,850
Let's keep moving!

313
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,110
I just felt a surge of emotion from Nami-san's heart!

314
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,740
She may have realized her feelings for me!

315
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,530
Still, what are these guys?!

316
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,020
They have sheep legs!

317
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,970
Isn't there some kind of mythical creature like that?

318
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,140
There's no point worrying about them now.

319
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,240
They'll have to wait
until we know what's going on here!

320
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,500
Wait!

321
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,050
Leave me!  I will remain here!

322
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,760
I saw no sign of my son
among the children you helped escape!

323
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,660
There must be other rooms!
I should remain and search-

324
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,410
And how are you planning to move around?!

325
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,650
Leaving you behind
would be the same as abandoning you to die!

326
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,360
It would leave me with a terrible aftertaste!

327
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,810
But I came here to save my son!

328
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,550
You're such an annoying bastard!

329
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,860
Just ask us!  Say "Please search for my body"!

330
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,740
Where is your body anyway?!

331
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,910
I refuse to be indebted to a pirate! 
 I would sooner die than ask for your help!

332
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,980
H-However...

333
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,340
if you were to search for my body...

334
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,340
I would not complain.

335
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,830
Damn this guy!

336
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,010
Why is a detached head
acting like he's better than me?!

337
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,870
You intend to use violence?!

338
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,670
I-I have no regrets!

339
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,430
I will not beg villains for my life!

340
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,030
Hey, give it a rest!

341
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,520
Would crushing a defenseless head really make you feel better?

342
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,250
The moment that you took him out of the cell,
you'd already lost, Sanji.

343
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,190
But...

344
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,040
This guy is really getting on my nerves!

345
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,270
I was a fool to admire his resolve,
even if it was just for a second!

346
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,620
I don't wanna help him any more!

347
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,240
Alas, I would be defenseless if you left me here,
but if you want to take me with you...

348
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I would not complain.

349
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,150
Damn... I'm gonna get you for this once you get your body back!

350
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,520
You show no mercy, even to a detached head.

351
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,940
Yes.  I should be careful what I say.

352
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,960
I wonder if Nami and the others have found an exit? 
Let's go after them!

353
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,940
Damn it, that itches!

354
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,480
Main entrance to the laboratory

355
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,000
Hello?  My name is Monkey D. Luffy! {Copy-paste from 579}

356
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,030
I'm the man who's gonna be the Pirate King!

357
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,860
You answered too soon, and you're saying too much!

358
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,860
Please, help me!

359
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,680
What's wrong?!

360
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,150
It's freezing... Is that you, boss?

361
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,780
No, I'm not your boss.

362
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,470
My companions keep getting cut down.

363
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,620
The samurai's gonna kill us all!

364
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,120
Where are you?!

365
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,520
Somebody please save me, I don't care who. {This one line is from 580's recap.}

366
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
I'm on...

367
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,340
Punk Hazard! {End copy-paste from 579}

368
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,900
The name of the island,
plus the mention of the cold climate.

369
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,850
There's no doubt about it,
this call was sent from this island.

370
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,030
You know Straw Hat Luffy, don't you?

371
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,110
Gomu Gomu no... {Not bothering with copy-pasting here because it's all just attack-names and one generic remark anyway.}

372
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,610
Fuusen!

373
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,910
Repel!

374
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,490
Room...

375
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,370
Shambles!

376
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,970
He got me!

377
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,780
Two years ago, during the incident
with the Celestial Dragons from the Roswald House,

378
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,940
you, Kid, and Luffy worked together.

379
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,050
What's more, during the great war...

380
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,430
Bring Straw-Hatter over here! {Copy-paste from 487}

381
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,140
I'm gonna take him away from this place!

382
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,150
Let me take care of him for now!

383
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,960
When Straw Hat was being pursued by Akainu...

384
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,580
you helped him escape.

385
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,160
What business do you have with me?

386
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,360
False distress calls is your specialty, isn't it?

387
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,540
Unfortunately,
this transmission wasn't one of our traps.

388
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,420
Quite a mystery.  But I don't know anything,
so this conversation is over.

389
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,940
Cut the crap.  Let us into the laboratory!

390
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,530
It's my vacation home now.  I refuse!

391
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,240
Is it so wrong for a pirate like me
to stay on an island that you've abandoned?

392
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,630
I'm the only one here.

393
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,200
If Straw Hat does show up, you can have his head.

394
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,990
If that's all you want, then you should leave!

395
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,450
Those frozen people were so scary!

396
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,920
I've had enough of this place!

397
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,910
Look!  There's a door!

398
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,880
We can get out of here!

399
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
Yay!

400
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,270
There's someone in there after all!

401
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,820
I'm out!

402
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,650
We're out!  It's freezing!

403
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,430
We're out of the building!  We can go home!

404
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,460
I can see Papa and Mama again!

405
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,080
It's so cold!

406
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,540
The Franky...

407
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,440
Tank is here!

408
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,670
Out of the way!  Out of the way!  Super-out of the way!

409
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,820
I will crush anyone who's in my way!

410
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,120
But I will avoid crushing flowers!

411
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,930
The just a little kindhearted, Franky Tank!

412
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,700
Super!

413
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,150
I can't tell what's the weirdest!

414
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,630
A giant raccoon dog, a winter bikini,
giant kids, a robot, or a detached head...

415
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,360
Am I dreaming?

416
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,230
I've seen you before!

417
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,620
Yeah!  It's the guy from Sabaody!

418
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,580
Were you the one who imprisoned these kids?!

419
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,840
You scum!  We're not giving them back to you!

420
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,250
And you!

421
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,130
Of all the atrocious fiends to run into... it's Smoker!

422
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,930
And with him is always a cutie-swaaan!

423
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,850
This isn't good!  We've run into the Navy!

424
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,470
We can't go this way!  We'll have to find another exit!

425
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,730
Hurry back inside!

426
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,210
Quickly kids!  Through to the other side!

427
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,550
There's gotta be a back door!

428
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,270
What's the Navy doing here?!

429
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,260
How should I know?!  Anyway, run!

430
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,210
Huh?  Isn't the Navy supposed to be good?

431
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,430
I suppose.  You can go to them!

432
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,660
No way!  They look like gangsters!

433
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,210
They're here, aren't they?!  Alone, my ass!

434
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,080
They were indeed here... to my surprise.

435
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Soldiers!  We will capture the Straw Hats!

436
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,040
Right, let's go!  Follow the Captain-chan!

437
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,170
Wait!

438
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,570
Is everyone alright?!

439
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,750
They've made things much more complicated.

440
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,730
The warship is floating!

441
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,030
Even the river is floating with it!

442
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,800
What is going on?!

443
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,100
I can't let you leave this island anymore.

444
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,710
Sorry that I said there wasn't anyone here.

445
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,140
This guy's bad news!

446
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,010
Stand back.

447
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,750
You can't lay a finger on him... He'd just pull it off!

448
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,690
Get him!

449
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,200
Show him the power of G-5!
