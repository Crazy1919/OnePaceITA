Just breathe in and close your eyes.

2481
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,060
Now, slowly open them again...

2482
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,520

2483
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,600

A skeleton!

2487
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,820
I said don't throw it at me!

2488
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,160
Why would a ship fall out of the sky?

2489
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,750
{Sure strange. - OG}It doesn't make sense.{arch/Korvic}

2490
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,080
There's nothing in the sky.

2491
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,000
Th-The Grand Line sure is a scary place.

2492
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,000
What is it, Nami-san?

2493
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,250
This is bad.

2494
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,550
The log pose is broken.

2495
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,970
It's stuck pointing up.{not much leeway here. Lit. "It's pointing upward and won't budge."}

2496
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,300
It's not broken.{Lit. it's just a "No." or "That's not true.", etc.}

2497
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,390
{[/q2]Its log has been overwritten by an island

â€“ A sky island?!
â€“ A sky island?!

2502
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,400
What even is that?

2503
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
{You're saying islands can fly? - lit. "float"}You're saying islands can float?{arch/Z}

2504
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,950
A-And that ship and the skeleton
fell down from there?

2505
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,240
I can't see a thing in the sky,
island or otherwise.

2506
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,870
{It's a little different. - lit. "That's not how it is/works"}That's not entirely true.{arch/Z}

2507
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,950
{In more precise terms,
it's the sea that's flying. - hmmm... again, it should be "floating", and it does fit better here. Maybe what works best is Robin keeping "flying" here, and then switching to "floating" in 4:31.}{Evo: I looked it up and according to someone on Reddit, clouds do technically fly, not float. So I think it's fine to keep that here? I do feel iffy about her saying "the" sea is flying; "a" feels more fitting but I'm also not quite sure there.}It's more accurate to say
that it's a floating sea.{arch/Z}

2508
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,660
{The sea? - OG}A sea?{arch/Korvic}

2509
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,130
It's just getting more confusing.{really, it should be "more and more"}

2510
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,050
Wow! So there's a sea floating
in the sky, and there're islands on it!{I'm sure there's a better way to transcribe his exclamation at the beginning...}

2511
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,260
{Alright! We're going there! - Really I wanted something "We're going right now!", but CPS is tight even with this. Could also make the following line start after the lip flaps to get some more space here.}Alright! We're going!{Evo, more CPS-friendly}

2512
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,590
Men! Set a course straight upward!

2513
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,550
{We're heading to the sky! - They're saying uwakaji ("up-rudder"), which is a play on omokaji/torikaji (starboard/port). I can't find a way to make this work except for "Rudder straight up", which might not work too well since "Rudder straight X" doesn't seem to be a set phrase. So I'd just replace it with some standard enthusiastic phrase about heading upwards.}{Later I had the idea of substituting some other pun along the lines of "shoot for the moon" or "the sky's the limit", if we can find one that works.}{Evo: how about saying *star*board with italics around star to convey the impossible upward movement while using nautical terms?}Up full rudder!{arch/Gaijin}

2514
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,520
{We can't really just
"sail upward", Captain.}Just how do you plan
to sail upward, Captain?{arch}

2515
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,440
{To be honest, I myself
do not know much about sky islands, - OG}To be honest, I don't know much about sky islands,{arch/Korvic}

2516
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,940
nor have I ever seen one.

2517
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,200
Of course you haven't! There's no way
islands or seas could float in the sky!

2518
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
{The log pose is just broken, that's all. - OG}The log pose is just broken.{arch/Z}

2519
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,780
No, Miss Navigator.{Do we have an unified rule for how Robin addresses Nami? If not, this probably works.}

2520
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,120
{What you should be worrying about
is not how to fix your log pose, - OG}What you should be worrying about
now is not your log pose.{Evo, not too happy with this new phrasing but I felt like the OG still implied that the log pose is broken so I wanted to change it}{Nice call, I missed that implication. -arch}

2521
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,370
It's how to get to the sky.

2522
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,170
No matter what bizarre circumstances
befall your ship,

2523
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,010
{or what panics it descends into, - "panic" needn't be kept one-to-one here, but I also can't find any good equivalent.}{or what crises it descends into, - Evo}or what danger it descends into,{arch/muffinman}

2524
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,550
you must never doubt your log pose.

2525
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,890
This is an ironclad rule.

2526
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,850
{[/q2]In these seas, it's your own common sense
that you should rather be doubting. - OG}In these seas, it's your own common sense
that you should doubt more than anything.{Evo}

2527
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,650
{Wherever this needle points to,
there's guaranteed to be an island. - OG}Wherever the needle points,
there's guaranteed to be an island.{arch/muffinman}

2528
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,120
What did she have to open
the coffin for?

2529
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,500
{Did you find something out? - OG}Find anything out?{arch/Korvic}

2530
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,370
We'll see.

2531
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,170
{Have some respect for the dead! - Lit: something like "You're tasteless"}This is quite tasteless, you know!{Evo}

2532
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,500
{Beautiful women and dead people
go surprisingly well together. - OG}A beauty handling human remains
is surprisingly alluring.{arch/Z}

2533
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,460
Hm? Where's Luffy?

2534
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,970
{â€“ Jump, Luffy!
â€“ !}Jump, Luffy!{arch: We can go with the first if someone finds a good way to transcribe Luffy's sound...}

2535
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,220
What are they up to this time?

2536
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,390
Exploring, they said.

2537
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,810
{Ah, it's fully reconstructed. - OG}Ah, it's fully restored.{arch/Korvic}

2538
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,310
These holes right here are man made.{This doesn't quite hit what I'm trying to go for yet. Lit. it's just "they were made by a person/human".}

2539
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,810
{I see. So this person died
after being stabbed in the head. - OG}Oh, so this person died
after being stabbed in the head.{arch/Z}

2540
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,320
{No, these were left
by medical treatment. - OG}Actually, they're the result
of a medical procedure.{arch/Z}

2541
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,530
{It's called trepanation.
Isn't it, Ship's Doctor? - OG}{Evo: might be good to just use "Doctor" for CPS, how important is it to keep the "Ship's"?}It's called trepanation.
Isn't it, Doctor?{arch: Yeah probably a good idea.}

2542
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,870
That's right. The technique of drilling holes
into the skull to treat brain tumors.{Really, "treat" is more like "hold back" or "control". I'd love to write "treat the symptoms of", but that doesn't fit.}

2543
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,490
{But I read that it hadn't been
used for centuries! - Or "heard that" or even "thought that". Really, I'm considering just taking the indirect reporting out entirely, since it makes Chopper seem less credible and reads like the statement could be wrong.}But that practice
hasn't been used for centuries!{arch}

2544
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,500
{[/q2]Exactly. It's been over two hundred years
since this man died.}Exactly. This man died
over two hundred years ago.

2545
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,710
He was in his early thirties.

2546
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,550
He died after falling ill at sea.

2547
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,140
Compared to his other bones,
his teeth were very well preserved...

2548
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,190
{since they had been painted with tar.}as they had been painted with tar.{arch: the next line also has "since"}

2549
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,070
{Since this particular custom is peculiar
to a certain region in the South Blue, - OG}Since this custom is unique
to a particular region in the South Blue,{Evo}

2550
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,030
history suggests that this vessel
was originally an expedition ship.

2551
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,750
There it is. The Saint Briss
of the South Blue's Kingdom of Briss.

2552
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,500
It set out 208 years ago.{or just "departed"}

2553
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,880
It looks just like the falling ship.

2554
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,420
{It did have an emblem
just like this one. - OG}Yeah, it did have the
same emblem too.{arch/Korvic}

2555
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,470
So for over two hundred years,
this ship has been wandering the skies.{Or "roaming"? Lit. it's "was lost, in the sky"}

2556
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,890
Can you really deduce
all these things from a skeleton?

2557
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,220
{Corpses cannot talk,
but they still tell plenty of tales.}{Though corpses do not talk,
they tell plenty of tales. - arch}{Even though they do not talk,
dead men tell plenty of tales. - Evo, I'd like the recognizable quote to be somewhere in here. I didn't want to deviate from the OG too much but I was even thinking something like "Those who say dead men tell no tales
simply don't know how to listen."}{Hmm. The original Japanese line doesn't directly reference the quote, so I didn't want to make it that explicit. I actually didn't have that quote in mind when first writing the line and only saw the parallels later on. So I'm gonna revert this. -arch}Though corpses do not talk,
they do tell plenty of tales.{arch/Korvic}

2558
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,060
{An expedition ship like this one - OG}An expedition ship like this should contain
plenty of records detailing its journey.{"detailing its journey" isn't in the original line, but of course implied. But lit. it's "plenty of evidence and records" which sounds a bit dry at the end}

Sure, but the ship's sunk intoâ€“

{\an8}Luffy! Grab my hand!{Lit. the second phrase is the classical "pull yourself together"/"come on". But this is just a generic panic phrase, so I tried something that fits better in English.}

2562
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,240
What are you doing?!

2563
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,990
{Everyone, look here! - OG}Everyone, check it out!{arch/Z}

2564
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,330
We did it!

2565
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
We found something really cool!

2566
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,750
Look at this!

2567
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,960
â€“ A map of a sky island?!
â€“ A map of a sky island?!{or "the Sky Island"}

{"Skypiea" - OG}"Skypiea."

2569
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,710
Right? Right?

2570
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,920
So there really is an island
in the sky?!

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,930
â€“ Yahoo!
â€“ Yahoo!

2572
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,550
Hooray! There really is a sky island!

2573
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,520
It's a dream island!
We can go to a dream island!{"dream island" doesn't make me 100% happy... I don't think it's "my dream island" as in "the island I always dreamed about", but "an island that usually only appears in dreams". But this is probably the best we can do.}

2574
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,390
Dream island!

2575
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,150
You're getting too excited!
This is nothing more than a possibility.

{There are tons of fake treasure maps in the world. - more literal}{There's as many fake maps
as there's fish in the sea. - arch}There are a lot
of fake maps in the world.{Evo. I feel like the fish one feels weirdly hyperbolic.}

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,540
You're a navigator! Figure it out!

2583
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,790
{\an8}Please?{We can just comment this if it feels too out of place}

2584
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,460
"Figure it out"?!
Do you think it's that easy?!{This is a full rewrite to carry on naturally from the previous line, so the second line can be any angry line}

2585
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,500
{\an8}Nami-san is so cute when she's angry.{Do we have a set format for this?}

2586
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,500
I don't care! I wanna go to the sky!

2587
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,630
We're getting nowhere with this!

2588
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,220
{In any case, we can't
just keep on sailing like this. - OG}In any case, we can't
keep sailing like this.{arch/muffinman}

2589
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,180
Like Robin said, what we need now
is more information.

2590
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,680
If that huge ship really was in the sky,

2591
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,430
{there must be some way
for our ship to go there too.}there must be some way
for the Merry to go there too.{arch: making Merry explicit to not have to juggle "this ship/that ship" as much}

2592
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,400
{Let's try to retrieve whatever
records are left on the sunken ship. - OG}Let's try to retrieve whatever
records are left on the wreck.{Evo: having Nami say the ship sank kind of negates Usopp's comment.}{nice catch -arch}

2593
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,730
But, that ship is
completely sunk by now.

2594
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,610
{If it's sunk, we need to salvage it! - OG}If it's sunk, then we need to salvage it!{arch/Korvic}

2595
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,400
â€“ Alright!
â€“ Alright!

2596
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,700
How, exactly?!{lit: "As if you could do that" - again this can be any angry tsukkomi type retort}

2597
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,030
{What's a "salvage"? - OG}What's "salvage"?{arch/PJ}

2598
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,660
It's the process of lifting
a sunken ship back up.

2599
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,580
But it's no use with that ship.
It's too big.

2600
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,090
Well, well, well...

2601
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,970
You're really making us do
something crazy here.{The "crazy" is more commonly translated as "reckless", but that doesn't feel like something Luffy would say. And it wouldn't fit the CPS either.}

2602
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,590
Yeah.

2603
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,140
Nami-swan!

2604
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,060
I'll be sure to find you some clues
on how to get to the sky!

2605
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,770
I'm counting on it.

2606
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,350
Don't worry about a thing!{Lit. "Don't worry and go" or "Go while not worrying"}

2607
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,560
My design is impeccable!

2608
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,030
And with that...

2609
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,820
good luck!

2610
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2611
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,120
Chopper here. Everyone, report in!

2612
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,580
Luffy here. There's a bunch
of monsters down here. Over!

2613
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,830
Is this a nest of giant sea snakes?

2614
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,000
Sanji here. Ahh, it's looking this way!

2615
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,380
{OK. - Understood. - I'm not sure I like translating OK literally here, but it also plays into a joke in the next line. So here's two options - the first is pretty literal.}{Evo: I really like the simplicity of the dry "OK"}Okay.{arch/Z}

2616
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,090
{No way that's OK!}That's it?!

2617
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,090
Don't worry, I'm sure
they'll manage somehow!

2618
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,010
{Chopper, be ready to hit
the brake anytime! - Reading this again, this is tough. Lit. it's like "keep a firm grip on the brake", but not to actually brake now, but to be ready the moment it's necessary.}{Chopper, be prepared to hit
the brake anytime! - arch}Chopper, keep the brake at the ready.{arch/Z}

2619
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,760
Got it.

2620
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,970
{Phew... Good thing
I didn't come with them. - OG}Phew... Good thing
I didn't go with them.{Evo}

2621

â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2629
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,550
This is where that ship sank?

2630
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,970
â€“ Aye aye, sir! Boss!
â€“ Aye aye, sir! Boss!

2631
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,940
And that boss... would be me!

Prepare to pull her up!{Lit. Prepare for pulling up}

2635
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,360

{Masira, the Salvage King! - OG}Salvage King Masira!{arch/PJ}

2637
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,870
Now of all times,
there's another weird bunch.

2638
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,700
You, right there!
What do you think you're doing?

{Indeed.}That's right.{arch}

2645
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,050
Yeah, they mentioned
that once or twice.

Stop that blabbering!

2648
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,900
Answer my question this instant!

2649
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,150
Excuse me!
Could I ask you a question?

2650
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,360
{[/i1]You're[/i0] gonna ask?!}You're asking now?!{arch: The other one could read like he's surprised that Nami's asking as opposed to another person}

2651
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,400
Very well. Ask me whatever you want.{or: "But fine. Ask away." ? The current one is more literal.}

2652

{halp.}{Are you looking to scrape up some salvage? - Went with this for now.}{Are you salvaging that ship

00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,070
"Ape-some"?

"Ape-some"?

2656
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
An ape that's handsome.
Is that what you think?

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,790
Sure!

2658
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,670
Ah, I don't know what to say!

2659
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,300
I don't think that's a real word.

2660
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,970
So, are you gonna salvage it?

2661
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,720
{Well, let's just say this: If I see
a sunken ship, I'm gonna pull it back up. - Kind of an awkward split. Could go for a rewrite involving "a guy like me will..." instead, though that loses a bit of the punch.}Well, let's just say this:
if a ship sinks, I unsink it!{arch/Z}

2662
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,970
That's the kind of guy I am.

{I'll salvage any ship,
even if I have to sink it myself first! - OG}I'll even sink a ship
just so I can salvage it!{arch/Z}

2664
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,400
There's no ship I can't
pull to the surface!

2665
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,400
{Then, could you let us watch? - The Japanese word for "watch" implies some kind of learning from it, which is why he answers as he does in the next line.}Then, do you mind if we
watch you at your craft?{arch/Z}

2666
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,070
Hm? Oh, have you
never seen a salvage before?

2667
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,870
Sure, then! Watch and learn!

2668
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,870
Good! For now, let's just
wait and see what he does.

2669
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,830
W-Watch out...

2671
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,630
What is it?!{Evo, added this line since there was no translation yet.}

2672
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,550
The crew that dove
down to set up the cradleâ€“

2673
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Did they run into a sea king?{Lit: "Were they taken out by a sea king." "Taken out" could mean kill, or just heavily injured. I'd use "done in" but that seems a bit too... disinterested? here.}

2674
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,890
{No... they look like they've been punched.}No... they look like
they got beat up by someone.{arch}

2675
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,270
{What?! So there's
somebody else on the sea floor?}What?! So there's
somebody else down there?{arch}

2676
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,430
Those three...

2677
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,980
Uh-oh...

2678
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,390
{Then... Hey, you two! - OG}Then...

2679

Hey, you bunch!{arch/PJ}

2680
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,360
Ah, well, that...

on the sea floor! Be careful!}There's someone
down there! Be careful!{arch}

2685
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,860
Hurry up and set up the cradle!

the air hose.{arch/muffinman}

2690
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,770
Yeah, I... I know.

2691

{Imagine them as pumpkins. - OG}Just imagine them naked!{arch/PJ}

2693
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,400
They're watching us now...

2694
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,530
but we shouldn't be getting nervous!

2695
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,240
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2696

â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,410
Watch out for whomever's down there!

2699
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,580
Aye aye, sir!

2700
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,750
He seems to really take pride in this.{I kinda hate this. With the context in mind I feel like what he's really saying is something like "He's really taking this seriously.", or "Looks like he has some reason [like pride] to take this really seriously. Can't find anything better right now.}

2701
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,500
It feels like he's trying to impress us.

2702
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,960
Don't just stand there!

2703
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,470
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2704
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,080
Hey!

2705
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,960
Look.

2706
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,940
The cradle is set and secure!

2707
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,740
{What?! - This line needs to be one that Usopp can salvage (heh) into some question that he'd ask at 16:08. Otherwise I'd have gone for "What's happening?!"}What'sâ€“{Evo, switched to en dash to convey the interruption}

2708
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,700

What's that monkey?

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,750
Ah, this?

2712
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,370
You have a good eye.

2713
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,710
That's not any old bow.

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,270
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

2727
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,690
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

2728
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,100
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

2729
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,900
{\an8}Monkey, monkey, monkey!

2730
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Woah!

2731
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,190
Wow! That's amazing!

2732
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,150
It's so cool!{Sonuvabitch!}

2733
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,150
{What is? - OG}It is?{arch/PJ}

2734
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,120
{Fourty meters to target. - OG}Forty meters to target.{Evo}

2735
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,620
Thirty meters.

2736
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,450
Twenty.

2737
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,080
Ten.

2738
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,830
Barco Hunter Joint:

2739
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
Complete!

2740
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,050
Alright!

2741
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,130
Start blowing!

2742
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,430
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2743
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,010
A-Are they really...

2744
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,810
{planning to lift it up by blowing in air?}going to blow in air to lift it up?{arch}

2745
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,110
Are they serious?

2746
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,700
An air bubble?

2747
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,130
The ship's started to float!

2748
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,510
Go! Pull it up!

2749
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,010
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2750
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,430
{Don't be slacking on the air supply! - OG}Keep the air supply steady!{arch/Korvic}

2751
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,940
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2752
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,780
Boss!

2753
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,660
Our underwater crew!

2754
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,610
What is it?!

2755
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,330
What happened, my dear underlings?

2756
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,250
There's someone inside the ship!

2757
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,090
{Whoever you are, how dare
you attack my underlings! - OG}How dare you attack my underlings,
whoever you are!{arch/Korvic}

2758
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,800
How dare you!{Lit. this is again "Who are you?!" (i.e. repeating the "whoever you are" line. But I'd be liberal here to make his dramatic posing work more. Alternatively this could just be joined with the previous line.}

2759
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
O-Oh, we're not planning
on taking pictures or anything.

2760
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,310
You're not?!

2761
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,020
Was he posing for a photo?

2762
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
Boss! Help us!

2763
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,440
I'm going down there!

2764
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,030
Continue pulling up the ship!

2765
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,650
â€“ Aye aye, sir!
â€“ Aye aye, sir!

2766
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,300
Monkey Punch!

2767
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,100
There it is.{Lit. "It came up, huh?"}

2768
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,850
{See? We can take those barrels off.}{See? We can get out
of those barrels now. - arch}See? We don't need
the barrels anymore.{arch/Z}

2769
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,780
Nice of them to pump in
so much air for us.

2770
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,650
{But who even are they,
trying to pull up this ship? - OG}But who would even be trying
to pull up this ship?{arch/Korvic}

2771
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm starting to think something happened
to Nami-san and Robin-chan.

2772
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,370
They're not responding
to any of our calls!{calls? hails? Or just something like "They haven't responded in forever" to avoid ambiguity?}

2773
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,750
Who are you?!

2774
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,250
{Raising hell on my turf! - OG}Raising hell in my waters!{arch/Z}

2775
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,960
Huh?

2776
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,050
{Ah... it's a monkey. - Evo: if we want to makee another pun here we could have Luffy say "An ape or something?" but that would probably change the meaning a bit too much.}Ah... some ape.{arch/Korvic}

2777
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,510
You think I'm that ape-some?

2778
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,760
Yeah, you're pretty apey.

2779
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,720
What's up with those words?

2780
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,470
What words?

2781
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,810
Anyway, who are you?

2782
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,430
Ah, I don't know what to say.

2783
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,900
Do you really think so?
You've got a great eye.

2784
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,940
{We're asking who you even are! - OG}We're asking who the hell you are!{arch/Korvic}

2785
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,320
{Usopp, I think there's something... - The name drop isn't there in the Japanese (it's just a "hey" or "say,") but I don't think it works well without one in English. Also, this line and the following one are switched in JP.}Um, I think there's something...{arch/Z}

2786
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,490
{Y-Yeah, there's something
under there...! - OG}{Y-Yeah, there's something
under the ship! - arch}Y-Yeah, there's something else
under the ship!{arch/Korvic}

2787
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,830
Oh, so you came from the East Blue!

2788
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,300
That's right! But, you know,
you really are like a monkey!

2789
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,050
Oh, you're too kind!

2790
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,860
{Maâ€“ - Don't know what she was trying to say here... Could also replace this with the start of some fitting English sentence or just drop it.}{Evo: I bracketed the "Ma-" for now as I think leaving this blank is the safer option. I'd be open to replacing it with something like "Wha-"}Whaâ€“{arch: Yup, let's just do that}

2791
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,870
{What is that?! What is happening?! - OG}What is that?! What the hell?!{arch: This is what I wanted to go for originally}
