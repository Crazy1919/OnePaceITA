Boss! Boss!

2463
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,520
What is this?!

2464
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,400
What is it?! What?! A continent?!

2465
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,150
{I don't know! I don't know! I can't see anything! I can't see anything! This is a dream! - OG}{I don't know! I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this! This is a dream! - Z}Don't ask me! I'm not seeing this!
I don't see anything! This is a dream!{Nirm}

2466
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,360
A dream?! Really?!

2467
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,550
– Phew, it's just a dream...
– Phew, it's just a dream...

2468
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,030
{Oh? - OG}Oh, my.{Z}

2469
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,830
{Were they all... - OG}It ate the ship...{Z}

2470
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,540
{...eaten along with the ship? - OG}{along with all who were in it. - Z}along with everyone inside.{PJ}

2471
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,290
{Ahh! You don't have to spell it out! - OG}Ahh! Don't go stating the obvious!{Z- rewording this so that Robin's next line can follow better}

2472
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,470
{There's no doubt about it; the air
supply hoses are going into its mouth. - OG}Obviously, those are the air supply hoses
running into its mouth.{Z- I wanted to make this line follow Usopp's outburst a bit more than it did}

2473
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,470
D-D-Don't... say... it...{\an8}

2474
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,150
Luffy and the others
were really eaten!

2475
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,910
{It was you who made them go
to the Grand Line's seabed! - OG}They only went to the Grand Line's seabed
because you made them!{Z}

2476
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,450
{You said it'd be okay even though you really didn't have any idea, that's why they...! - OG}You said it'd be okay even though you knew
that it wasn't, and now they're...!{Z}

2477
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,660
You're right.

2478
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,710
{I'm sorry! - OG}Sorry!{Nirm}

2479
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,710
You've got the right idea, but...

2480
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,770
Unless we cut the hoses,

2481
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,730
{we'll be dragged into the depths
of the ocean with the ship. - OG}we'll be dragged
into the ocean depths with the ship.{Z}

2482
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,230
– No!
– No!

2483
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,690
{Robin! You're strong, aren't you?!
Do something! - OG}Robin! You're strong, right?!
Do something!{Nirm}

2484
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,650
I can't. That thing is too big.

2485
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,280
{Okay, you guys, - OG}{Okay, everyone! - Z}Everyone!{Nirm}

2486
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,150
{pull those ropes and save our boss! - OG}{Pull those ropes and save our boss! - Z}Pull those ropes and save the boss!{RF}

2487
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,830
Show your pride and honor
as Masira Pirates!

2488
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,790
{Our boss is still alive! - OG}The boss is still alive!{RF}

2489
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,750
{That's right! Our unity is
tested at a time like this! - OG}That's right!
Times like these test our unity!{Nirm}

2490
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,800
Usopp!

2491
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
Yeah!

2492
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,150
Cut the hoses to ensure our safety!

2493
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,260
{Are you a devil? - OG}Are you a monster?{arch}

2494
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,680
{She's a devil! - OG}She's a monster!{arch}

2495
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,770
{What?! What's going on?! - OG}What...? What's going on now?!{Z}

2496
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,230
It became night?!

2497
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,490
Can't be! It's not that late yet!

2498
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,200
Then, what's going on?!
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

2499
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,580
{How ominous...! This sudden night
is a sign that monsters will appear! - OG}{How ominous...! Sudden nightfall
is a sign that monsters will appear! - Z- I wonder if "How ominous...!" could be "It's a bad omen!"}It's an omen! Sudden nightfall
means that monsters will appear!{Nirm}

2500
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,630
{They'll sink our ship!
Hurry up and save our boss! - OG}They'll sink our ship!
Hurry up and save the boss!{RF}

2501
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,760
– Luffy!
– Luffy!

2502
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,810
Luffy! What happened?!
Are you dead?!

2503
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,980
Zoro! Sanji!

2504
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,240
Set sail! Hurry up and get out of here!

2505
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
{He's crazy... - OG}That's one crazy customer...{Z- keeping it ambiguous so that Usopp thinks Sanji is talking about the turtle and not Masira}

2506
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,610
{I'm glad you were safe! Yeah, let's
get away from that turtle anyway! - OG}I'm glad you're safe! But yeah!
Let's get away from that turtle!{Z}

2507
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,820
{Turtle? No, there was
a monkey in the sea! - OG}Turtle? No, there was
a monkey down there.{arch}

2508
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:58,860
Turtle? No, there was
a monkey down there.

2509
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,950
{He must be one of the sea animals. - OG}Definitely a sea creature too.{Z}{Maybe move the subs along with the video?}

2510
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,990
{He must be one of the sea animals. - OG}Definitely a sea creature too.

2511
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,030
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2512
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,070
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2513
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,110
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2514
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,200
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2515
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,240
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2516
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,830
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2517
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:04,870
He was getting along
with Luffy for a while.

2518
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,580
{Since they're both monkeys. - OG}They're both monkeys, after all.{Z}

2519
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:06,620
They're both monkeys, after all.

2520
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,090
But when he saw this stuff
that we got from the ship,

2521
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,710
{he suddenly started going on a rampage. - OG}he suddenly went on a rampage.{Z}

2522
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:11,790
Just like a rampaging gorilla!

2523
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,830
Just like a rampaging gorilla!

2524
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,870
Just like a rampaging gorilla!

2525
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,920
Just like a rampaging gorilla!

2526
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Just like a rampaging gorilla!

2527
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,590
{He went on a rampage like a gorilla! - OG}{Just like a gorilla on a rampage! - Z}Just like a rampaging gorilla!{Nirm}

2528
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,510
{His name's Masira, he's a salvager. - OG}{That was Masira. He's a salvager. - Z}That was a salvager named Masira.{Z}

2529
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,630
{But it's amazing that you guys could
escape from that turtle's mouth! - OG}I'm just amazed you guys
escaped the turtle's mouth!{Z}

2530
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,800
Turtle? What turtle?

2531
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,380
{Hm?
Something's wrong with the turtle. - OG}Hm? The turtle is acting weird.{Nirm}

2532
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,350
{His mouth's staying open...
Oh, that's why you could escape! - OG}His mouth's open...
Oh, that's how you escaped!{Nirm}

2533
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,220
– Whoa! What the hell is that?!
– Whoa! What the hell is that?!

2534
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,320
Hey! Get a clue!
That thing ate you and the ship!

2535
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,690
Hm? Why's it nighttime?

2536
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,580
Luffy! Give me a hand!
We're gonna set sail!

2537
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,500
Hold it!

2538
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,290
You punks!

2539
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,680
{Don't think you can get away
after stealing treasure from my turf! - OG}Don't think you can steal treasure
from my waters and get away with it!{Z- "waters" instead of "turf"}

2540
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,510
Treasure?! There was treasure?!

2541
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,640
{Yeah, there was a lot. - OG}Yeah, there was lots.{RF}

2542
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,810
{Crap! If that guy goes on
a rampage on the ship...! - OG}This isn't good. If this guy starts
rampaging on our ship...{Z}

2543
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,070
{B-Boss...! Behind you! - OG}Ah... B-B-Boss...! B-Behind you!{Z}

2544
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,280
{Hm? What is it?! - OG}Hm? Behind me?{Z}

2545
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,420
– Monsters!
– Monsters!

2546
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,780
{No way... - OG}There's just no way...{Z}

2547
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,700
{No way can someone be that big... - OG}There's no way someone
could be that big...{Z}

2548
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,380
Man, the Grand Line is just
one mystery after another!

2549
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,500
{Today, too. - OG}Today is no exception.{Z- It's a little above the acceptable CPS, but this is normally what someone would say in this situation}

2550
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,130
We saw a huge galleon fall from the sky.

2551
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,590
{The needle of the log pose
is now pointing to the sky. - OG}The needle of our log pose
began pointing toward the sky.{Z}

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,100
{A weird monkey appeared
and salvaged the ship. - OG}A weird ape appeared
and salvaged the ship.{Z}

2553
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,520
{Then, we saw a huge turtle
that[/i1]ate[/i0]the whole ship. - OG}{However, we witnessed a huge turtle
that swallowed the ship whole! - Z}However, a huge turtle swallowed the ship whole!{PJ}

2554
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,190
Then night came.

2555
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,820
{And, at the end, we saw huge monsters who were dozens of times larger than the giants! - OG}At the end there were huge monsters
dozens of times taller than giants!{Z}

2556
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,740
{Yeah, those guys scared even me. - OG}Yeah, even I was scared
of those guys.{Z}

2557
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,040
– Beat it!
– Beat it!

2558
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,640
{In any case,
those monsters were huge. - OG}{I just can't get over
how ginormous those monsters were. - Z}Although, I just can't get over
how enormous those monsters were.{Nirm and Z}

2559
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,300
Yeah...
I don't ever wanna see them again.

2560
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,260
You know, Chopper...

2561
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,550
Hm?

2562
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,390
{If I went all out, I would've
been able to beat them. - OG}If I went all out,
I would be able to defeat them.{Z}

2563
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,470
Really?!

2564
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,850
I've beaten ten of them before.

2565
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,100
Ten of them?!

2566
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,400
What on earth did you guys
go into the water for?

2567
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,240
{This stuff is all junk, and I don't see
any clues on how to get to the sky! - OG}All this stuff is junk, and I don't see
any clues on how to get to the sky!{RF}

2568
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,990
Like I said, there was nothing!

2569
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,540
Well... that's the truth, Nami-san.

2570
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,710
It was clear that the ship
had already been plundered.

2571
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,050
{Or perhaps that there was some sort of mutiny, and they killed each other. - OG}That, or it was some kind of mutiny
where they killed one another.{Z}

2572
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,360
{Then, all the more reason
that we need information! - OG}That's all the more reason
why we need information!{Z}

2573
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,990
You see, if we are to go to the sky,

2574
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,170
{that means what happened to
that ship could happen to us! - OG}what happened to that ship
could also happen to us!{Z}

2575
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,510
{We need information to stay alive,
and what'd you get?! - OG}Information means survival,
but what did you get?!{Z}

2576
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,270
Rusty swords, dishes,
and a live octopus?!

2577
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,880
{We need stuff
like a "journal" or a "sea chart"! - OG}{What we need
is a journal or a sea chart! - Z- I see that the quotation marks were being used to emphasize the items, but they weren't needed}What we need
are journals or sea charts!{arch}

2578
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,770
{What's that, Luffy? - OG}And what did you find, Luffy?{Z}

2579
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,760
Armor.

2580
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,850
Whoa! She crushed the armor!

2581
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,890
I got pretty seashells
for you, Nami-san!

2582
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,980
{I don't need them, you big dummy! - OG}That's not what I need, dimwit.{Z}

2583
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,100
{Nami-[/i1]san[/i0]'s cute when she's mad, too! - OG}Nami-san is cute
even when she's mad!{Z}

2584
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,820
{You'd better keep your
distance from her right now. - OG}Maybe steer clear of her for now.{Z}

2585
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,610
{Having a tough time? - OG}Not much help, are they?{Z- I think this captures the spirit of what Robin is getting at, based on Nami's next response}

2586
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,820
{It's only gonna get worse!
Really, they're all a bunch of idiots! - OG}That's an understatement.
They're in the morons' hall of fame!{Z- like the dumbest dummies out there}

2587
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,780
Now we can't get to our destination.

2588
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,490
Here...

2589
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,290
What?! An eternal pose... This...

2590
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,380
{I took it from those monkey
people's ship earlier... just in case. - OG}I took it from the ship
that the ape and his men were on.{Z}

2591
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,720
{You're the only one on my side! - OG}You're my only ally here!{Z}

2592
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Hey, we've got an octopus!
Let's make some takoyaki!

2593
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,730
It must be quite tough for you.

2594
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,730
Jaya...

2595
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,780
{It must be their headquarters. - OG}{It must be their base of operations. - Z}It must be where they operate from.{Nirm}

2596
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,530
Jaya? Are we going there?

2597
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,660
{That's your decision, you idiot! - OG}That's a decision for our idiot captain!{Z}

2598
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,040
{Alright! Jaya rudder full! - OG}Alright! Full Jaya rudder!{Z- I'm getting the sense that Luffy is calling it "Jaya rudder" instead of just "rudder"}

2599
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,890
{Jaya rudder full! - OG}Full Jaya rudder!{Z}

2600
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,170
{Nami, which direction would that be? - OG}Nami... in which direction?{Z}

2601
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,460
Starboard.

2602
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,920
Chopper, give me a hand!

2603
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,920
Okay!

2604
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,890
{Jaya speed ahead! - OG}Full Jaya speed ahead!{Z- same as the rudder note}

2605
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,320
Hey, hold on a second...

2606
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,640
If we go to that Jaya place,

2607
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,600
won't the log be updated there again?

2608
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,390
In other words...

2609
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,610
{we won't be able to go to Sky Island. - OG}we won't be able to go
to the sky island.{Z}

2610
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,480
What?!

2611
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,190
{Stop Jaya rudder! - OG}{Full stop Jaya rudder! - Z- or should this be "Jaya rudder full stop!"?}Jaya rudder full stop!{Nirm}

2612
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,670
Hey, Nami! What's the deal?!

2613
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,660
{What?! You're the one
who decided to go to Jaya. - OG}Don't look at me. You're the one
who decided to go to Jaya.{Z}

2614
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,120
{Oh, yeah... - OG}Oh. That's true.{Z}{This line should match the one at 12:11}

2615
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,540
{But I didn't think this'd happen! - OG}But I didn't know this would happen!{Z}

2616
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,700
{It's your fault that you didn't think of it! - OG}That's your own fault, then.{Z}

2617
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,420
{The log pose has always
worked like this, right?! - OG}You know as well as anyone
how a log pose works, right?!{Z}

2618
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,840
{Oh, yeah... - OG}Oh. That's true.{Z}{This line should match the one at 12:01}

2619
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,960
{Hey, listen up! - OG}Alright, listen up!{Z}

2620
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,040
{Since I'm the captain,
I'll decide where we're going! - OG}As your captain,
I decide where we go!{Z}

2621
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,880
{I wanna go to Sky Island! - OG}I wanna go to the sky island!{Z}

2622
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,680
{Okay, but how? - OG}Sure thing. How do we get there?{Z}

2623
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
{We're best off asking someone. - OG}We should start by asking around.{Z}

2624
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,020
{eah, let's ask in Jaya. - OG}Yeah. We could ask people in Jaya.{Z}

2625
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,390
{Then, we should go to Jaya. - OG}Jaya it is then.{Z}

2626
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,700
{Alright, then! Jaya rudder full! - OG}Alright, full Jaya rudder!{Z}

2627
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,270
Wait! You're going in circles!

2628
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,470
{It's not as if a log can be
stored as soon as we get there. - OG}The log won't change
the moment we get there.{Z}

2629
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,200
{So why don't we go to Jaya and leave
before the next log gets stored? - OG}How about we go to Jaya and leave
before the next log is registered?{Z- per Gaijin from awhile back, registering the log is more accurate than storing it}

2630
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,620
{I guess we need some luck. - OG}We'll need some luck, though.{Z- we'll probably need a TLQC to break down this line. The OG is way too vague.}

2631
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,160
{Okay, then, we'll do what you just said... - OG}– Yeah, let's do that thing you just said.
– Yeah, let's do that thing you just said.{Z}

2632
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,410
{Alright, guys!
Let's go to Jaya, Land of Meat! - OG}Alright, guys!
To Jaya, the Land of Meat!{Z}

2633
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,160
{Yeah! - OG}– Yeah!
– Yeah!{Z}

2634
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,810
{Don't dream up stuff like that! - OG}Maybe in your dreams!{Z}

2635
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,290
I wonder what kind of place Jaya is.

2636
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,670
Nami-swan! Robin-chwan!

2637
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,090
{Your "Unprecedented takoyaki
just for ladies" are ready! - OG}Just for the ladies,
please enjoy some takoyaki surprise.{Z- I doubt this will show up again, so no need to put this special takoyaki in the wiki, I think}

2638
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,050
{Now you're all out of money. - OG}That was the last of your money.{Z}

2639
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,480
Roshio "the Executioner"
Captain of the Roshio Pirates
Bounty: 42 Million Belly

2640
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,480
Roshio "the Executioner"
Captain of the Roshio Pirates
Bounty: 42 Million Belly

2641
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,640
So then...

2642
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,480
{wanna bet your pants or something, brother? - OG}{will you bet your pants next, brother? - Z}will you bet your skivvies next, brother?{PJ}

2643
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
{You're lucky, in a sense. - OG}In a way, you're actually kinda lucky.{Z}

2644
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,950
{Playing with Roshio, if you had won,
he would have made you pay for it. - OG}You're playing Roshio, so if you had won,
he'd take it out of your hide.{Z}

2645
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,370
Sorry, but I'll be taking
all your money.

2646
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,210
You cheated just now, didn't you?

2647
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,290
{Ain't that right? - OG}I'm right, ain't I?{Z}

2648
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,300
What'd you say? When did I do that?

2649
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,470
You did! You cheated!

2650
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,890
{Don't make ridiculous accusations, you punk! - OG}That's a baseless accusation, punk!{Z}

2651
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,160
Sarquiss! Sarquiss!

2652
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,890
Hm? What?

2653
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,900
You saw it, too, didn't you?
This guy just cheated.

2654
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,150
Cheated?

2655
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,230
Yeah... That's right. He cheated.

2656
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,250
I saw it, too. What a dirty cheat!

2657
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,490
Don't screw with me!
You don't know who you're dealing with!

2658
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:32,770
Bellamy "the Hyena"
Captain of the Bellamy Pirates
Bounty: 55 Million Belly

2659
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:32,770
Bellamy "the Hyena"
Captain of the Bellamy Pirates
Bounty: 55 Million Belly

2660
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,100
Still don't see it, Usopp?

2661
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,230
No, I don't see it yet.

2662
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,560
This Jaya island isn't that far, right?

2663
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,490
Yeah, since the weather has
been stable for a while now,

2664
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,860
we should already be
in the island's climate.

2665
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,950
Then, Jaya must be a spring island.

2666
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,660
It feels nice and warm.

2667
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,870
Spring weather's nice.

2668
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,840
It looks like the seagulls
are enjoying it, too.

2669
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,510
{Ahhh! They were shot! - OG}Ahh! They've been shot!{Z}

2670
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,600
{Oh, let's make yakitori! - OG}Oh! Then let's make yakitori!{Z}

2671
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,020
Shot? I didn't hear any gunfire.

2672
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,520
{Look, I found a bullet! - OG}See?! A bullet!{Z}

2673
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,390
{Considering the direction that they were flying,
the bullets came from the direction the ship's facing! - OG}Judging from the birds' heading,
the shooter is straight ahead!{Z}

2674
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,320
{Are you saying that shots came from
an island that we can't even see yet? - OG}Shots came from an island
we can't even see yet?{Z}

2675
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
That's impossible, Chopper.

2676
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
But I was watching them
the whole time!

2677
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,160
{Then what kind of eyesight, sniping skills and rifle do you think this sniper has? - OG}What sharpshooter has
that kind of eyesight, skills, and rifle?{Z}

2678
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,860
{They were shot somewhere else
and just happened to fall now. - OG}They were probably shot earlier
and finally fell here.{Z}

2679
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,210
Sanji, we got seagulls!

2680
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,640
{Poor thing... He must've suffered. - OG}{Poor thing.
How it must have suffered. - Z}Poor thing. It must have suffered.{Nirm}

2681
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
West Coast, Jaya

2682
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
West Coast, Jaya

2683
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,720
I wasn't able to kill one of them instantly.

2684
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,920
{But that's also fate. - OG}{But that's just fate. - Z}But such is fate.{PJ}

2685
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,730
{That's the result of how you lived. - OG}This is the result
of how one lived their life.{Z}

2686
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,400
Hey, you! Do you know who I am?!

2687
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
{Huh? I don't know, you fool! - OG}Huh? Of course I don't, you oaf!{Z}

2688
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,200
{How about I tell you, then?
I'm a fighting champion. - OG}Then let me tell you.
I'm a champion fighter, you see.{Z}

2689
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,250
Wow! Cool!

2690
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,130
{I see a neat-looking town! - OG}This town looks neat!{Z}

2691
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,090
Hey, hey, doesn't it look
kinda like a resort?

2692
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,090
Resort?!

2693
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,590
Hurry up, Merry!

2694
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,470
{Yeah, it makes me feel like
I want to stick around a bit. - OG}{No kidding! It makes me wish
we were sticking around a bit longer. - Z}No kidding! It makes me wish
we weren't in such a rush.{Nirm}

2695
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,660
{But is it my imagination, or do the ships lined up in the harbor look like pirate ships? - OG}Am I imagining things, or are these
all pirate ships docked in the harbor?{Z}

2696
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,590
{Silly Usopp, since when can pirate ships
just openly line up in a harbor?! - OG}Get real, Usopp! Since when can
pirate ships openly dock in a harbor?{Z}

2697
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,150
Y-You're right!

2698
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,200
Help me! He's gonna kill me!

2699
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,490
– What's with this town?
– What's with this town?{Z- wish I could do something like "This town had so much potential!" but that's probably too far off the mark}

2700
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,920
What a weakling!

2701
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey, mister.
You chose the wrong guy to beat up.

2702
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,050
{Look at that symbol. He's one of Roshio's gang. - OG}{Look at that symbol.
He's a member of Roshio's gang. - Z}Look at that symbol.
He's one of Roshio's men.{Z}

2703
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,300
You've heard of him, right?

2704
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,050
{Roshio the Executioner, whose bounty is 42 million belly. - OG}Roshio the Executioner
has a bounty of 42 million belly!{Z}

2705
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,270
He's crazy, so you'd better be careful.

2706
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,290
{What a reckless guy!
That wasn't a bogus game. - OG}{That guy needs to watch himself!
The game was won fair and square. - Z}{What a reckless guy!
That game was won fair and square! - Z}What a lunatic!
That game was won fair and square!{arch/Gaijin}

2707
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,690
{But it's amazing that he beat up
Roshio the Executioner so easily. - OG}But look how easily
he took down Roshio the Executioner.{Z}

2708
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,940
Don't you know? That's Bellamy.

2709
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,410
{That guy?! Bellamy the Hyena,
the one with a 55 million-Berry - OG}Th-That guy?!
With a 55-million-belly bounty...{Z}

2710
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,910
{bounty on his head?! - OG}{[/i1]That[/i0]Bellamy the Hyena?! - Z}Bellamy the Hyena?!{Z}

2711
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,910
Captain!

2712
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,410
Who did this?!

2713
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,670
{In any case, he needs a doctor!
Hurry up! - OG}For now, he needs a doctor! Quickly!{Z}

2714
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,830
{Captain, please hang on a little longer. - OG}Please hang on a little longer, Captain!{Z}

2715
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,550
There're all kinds of people here.

2716
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,690
It looks like a fun town.

2717
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,610
{There's no way... - OG}Not a chance.{Z}

2718
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,650
{You think those two can come
back without getting into trouble? - OG}{Think those two will come back
without finding any trouble? - Z}You think those two will come back
without getting into trouble?{Z}

2719
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,400
{[/q2]Well, the town looks dangerous as it is. - OG}Well, with how dangerous this town looks...?{Z}

2720
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,430
{It's next to impossible. - OG}I'd say it's next to impossible.{Z}

2721
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,120
{That's right. They can't do that! - OG}You're right! I can't let that happen!{Z}

2722
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,120
H-Hey, Nami!

2723
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,120
{Wait for me, Luffy! Zoro! - OG}Wait up! Luffy! Zoro!{Z}

2724
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,890
{She went... - OG}She left us...{Z}

2725
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,970
{Well, she'll probably be okay,
since those two are with her. - OG}She'll probably be okay
with those two around.{Z}

2726
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,080
What? If Nami-san's going, then I'm...

2727
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,210
{Don't you go! - OG}You don't get to go!{Z}

Please don't go!

2730
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,720
Fine! Let go of me!

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,180
{Then, guess I'll prepare some tea and hold the fort. - OG}Guess I'll make some tea
while I hold down the fort.{Z}

2732

{Hm? Where's Robin-[/i1]chan[/i0]? - OG}Huh? Where's Robin-chan?{Z}

2733
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,480
Oh...? She's not here.

2734
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,150
Sanji-kun, about that tea–

2735
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,150
Make it yourself.

2736
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,890
In this town, I will...

2737
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,990
...not fight. I give my word!

2738
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,200
{...not fight. I give my word. - OG}I will not fight. I give my word.{Z}

2739
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,590
{Good. This is serious, you two. - OG}Good. You two need
to take this seriously.{Z}

2740
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,540
– Yeah...
– Yeah...

2741
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,040
What's with the weak reply?!

2742
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,710
If you cause trouble,
we'll have to leave this town!

2743
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,590
{If that happens, we won't be
able to go to the sky, got that?! - OG}Then we'll never find a way
up to the sky. Got it?{Z}

2744
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah.

2745
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,050
{Who's he? - OG}Who...?{Z}

2746
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,860
{Look, he fell from a horse. - OG}Look. He fell from his horse.{Z}

2747
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,720
{Yeah, he did. - OG}Yeah. He sure did.{Z}

2748
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,580
{Looks like he's in pain. - OG}He's in a lot of pain.{Z}

2749
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,720
{Yeah, it does. - OG}Yep. Lots of pain.{Z}

2750
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,270
{Hey you guys, sorry to bother you,
but please help me get up. - OG}Pardon me, fellas... but can you
please help me back up?{Z}

2751
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,060
{You're not going to get up
by yourself, are you? - OG}Not even gonna try on your own?{Z}

2752
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,820
Luffy, get that side.

2753
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,780
Okay.

2754
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,450
{Well, thanks... I'm on the horse now. - OG}Ah, many thanks! I'm back up.{Z}

2755
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,510
{I was born frail. - OG}I was born with a weak constitution.{Z}

2756
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,340
Now, let's go, Stronger.

2757
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,750
– The horse, too?!
– The horse, too?!

2758
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,030
{Geez, what a pain. - OG}What a pain...!{Z}

2759
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,590
{Thanks again. - OG}Once again, you have my gratitude.{Z}

2760
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,050
This isn't much of a reward,
but would you like some?

2761
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,710
You're too suspicious!
We don't want any, so beat it already.

2762
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,560
Hey, apples! Thanks!

2763
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,560
Hey, hey!

2764
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,310
What?! What happened?!

2765
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,800
{Well, some guys were eating apples
that they got from a strange man, - OG}These guys were eating some apples they got from a strange man,{Z- not perfect, but it reduces the CPS by two}

2766
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,770
{and then they exploded. Five of them! - OG}and then the five of them all exploded!{Z}

2767
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,610
Oh, no...

2768
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,040
Luffy! Spit it out!
Spit out the apple you just ate! Now!

2769
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,830
I've already swallowed it.

2770
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,660
{You bastard!
What's the meaning of this?! - OG}Okay, creep! Start talking!{Z}

2771
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,250
{Well, he's all right. - OG}It seems he's okay.{Z}

2772
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,340
That's going too far.
It's a disaster inside.

2773
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,830
If you ate a bad one,
you would've died on the first bite.

2774
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,380
You're...

2775
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,350
lucky.

2776
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,350
Hey, what the hell is this?

2777
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,100
Roshio the Executioner's grave.

2778
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,450
{It looks as if a war happened here. - OG}It's like the aftermath of a war.{Z- or battle}

2779
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,660
{Did they fire a cannon or something
in the middle of the town? - OG}Did a cannon go off
in the middle of town?{Z}

2780
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,210
{Who knows? Even people who
were actually watching it said that they couldn't tell what was happening.- OG}{Dunno... Witnesses are saying
[/q2]that they couldn't tell what was happening. - Z}Dunno... People are saying they
couldn't tell what was happening.{RF}

2781
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,360
{All we know... - OG}All we know for sure{Z}

2782
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,820
is that Roshio's opponent was Bellamy.

2783
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,330
{Oh, Bellamy the Hyena? - OG}Bellamy the Hyena?{Z}

2784
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,080
{There's no doubt that he's got
the power of one of the devil fruits. - OG}He for sure has a devil fruit power.{Z}

2785
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,050
Just what is up with this town?!

2786
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,170
{Well, don't be so touchy, Nami. - OG}It's not really a big deal, Nami.{Z}

2787
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,430
You almost got killed for no reason, you know!

2788
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,300
I guess it happens sometimes.

2789
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,810
{I'll be damned if it does! - OG}{Not on my watch! - Z}"Sometimes" doesn't even come close!{arch}

2790
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,250
{That guy again... - OG}That guy is at it again.{Z}

2791
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,150
{How many victims
have there been now? - OG}How many people
has he beaten now?{Z}

2792
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,190
It's not like
he's a famous wanted man.

2793
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,360
{Who the heck is he? - OG}Just who is he?{Z}

2794
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,460
Well, I don't even wanna know.

2795
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,910
{In any case, we should stay away
from that fighting champion. - OG}{In any case, we need to clear a path
for that champion fighter. - Z}In any case, we need to stay away
from that champion fighter.{arch}

2796
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,640
– Champion?
– Champion?

2797
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,000
{Why are you trying to compete?! - OG}{What?! Are you looking to compete?! - Z}What?!
Are you looking to compete now?!{arch}

2798
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,790
Ugh... I wonder if we can really
get information in a town like this.

2799
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,220
How about this place?

2800
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,090
{Hmm... This place seems quiet. - OG}Hmm... This place is kinda quiet.{Z}

2801
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,640
{Or rather, this place is lovely! - OG}More like... this place is lovely!{Z}

2802
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,830
{So although this is a rough town,
it has a place like this. - OG}To think that a rough town
has a place like this.{Z}

2803
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,000
{They have a vacation house on the sea, huh? - OG}A seaside resort, huh?{Z}

2804
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,980
{In any case, there's no one here...
although I can smell tasty food. - OG}There doesn't seem to be anyone here...
but I can smell tasty food.{Z}

2805
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,320
{E-Excuse me! Please - OG}D-Dear customers!
Dear customers, please,{Z}

2806
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,030
{don't
come in without permission! - OG}you need permission to enter!{Z}

2807
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,030

{Th-This Tropical Hotel is currently chartered by Bellamy-sama and his party. - OG}Th-The Tropical Hotel is currently chartered
by Master Bellamy's party.{Z- the name of the Hotel is romanized on its sign}

2809

So we're asking other guests
to, er... leave.

2810
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,960
{Oh, this place was a hotel? - OG}Oh? A hotel, is it?{Z}

{it'll be a problem,
so please kindly leave immediately. - OG}it'll mean big trouble,
so please leave immediately!{Z- "please" and "kindly" are redundant, so just one will do}

2813
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,390
C'mon, what's wrong
with just coming in here?

2814
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,010
{Who's Bellamy? - OG}So who's this Bellamy?{Z}

2815
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,180
Hey, what's going on?

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,100
{Who the hell are those shabby guys? - OG}Who the hell are these sad sacks?{Z}

Just get rid of them already! - OG}Stuff your excuses and boot 'em!{Z- Good CPS and fits under the caption}

{How much do you think we're
paying to charter this place?! - OG}Aren't we paying a boatload for this place?{Z- had to squeeze this one in under the caption.}

2822
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,780
She's right.
Now, go home, you dumb brat!

2823
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,740
Hey, can I beat him up?

2824
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,610
– No!
– No!

2825
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,830

{What funny guys! At any rate,
those are rags you're wearing. - OG}These guys are a riot!{Z}

2827
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,740

{Take this money and buy
yourselves something you like. - OG}Go and buy something
to replace those rags.{Z}

2829
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,420
Sarquiss, you're wasting money

{Maybe I should have thrown
it down the drain instead. - OG}I should've thrown it
down the drain instead.{Z}

2831
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,340
Oh? Are you sure?

2832
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,590
Let's go! This is unpleasant!

2833
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,710
{Hey, hey, I can walk on my own. - OG}Hey, I can walk on my own.{Z}

2834
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,010
Oh? You don't want it?

2835
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,850
Sarquiss! Lily!
Don't tease them so much.

2836
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,560
Oh, that's where you were.

2837
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,250
{They, too, worked hard
in their own way to travel here. Here. - OG}They, too, worked hard
in their own way to travel here. Look.{PJ}

{Of course, compared to you and Bellamy, they're trash, but... - OG}They're obviously trash
compared to you and Bellamy, but...{Z}

2839
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,530
The Bellamy Pirates

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,530
The Bellamy Pirates

{For average guys,
they're doing better than others. - OG}{They're doing well
for such average pirates. - Z}They're doing well
for such mediocre pirates.{PJ}

{Well, they probably won't be able to survive n the new era that is about to start, after all.[/an8] - OG}{Anyway, I doubt they'll survive
in the new era that's about to start. - Z}Doesn't matter. I doubt they'll survive
in the new era that's about to start.{RF}

2843
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,170
Still... I see, 30 million...
for that greenhorn?

2844
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,830
{I'll show this to Bellamy. - OG}I want Bellamy to see this.{Z}

2845
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,340
Dammit! I'm really pissed!

2846
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,940
That's a shame.

2847
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,010
Mock Town depends on pirates
who spend lots of money, after all.

2848
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,490
So poor pirates aren't invited, huh?

2849
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,480
{Looks like there's no way
of calming you down. - OG}There's just no calming you down,
is there?{Z}

2850
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,650
{Here, this is on the house. - OG}Here. It's on the house.{Z}

2851
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,460
Since tough guys gather here,
there's lots of trouble.

2852
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,240
{But if you get bothered by it each time, you can't get by in this town. - OG}But you can't get by in this town
if you let it stop you.{Z}

2853
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,470
All you can do is play it safe
when dealing with people.

2854
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,110
Here you go.

2855
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,580
{But this town is really unpleasant, you know! - OG}Doesn't change the fact
that this town is unpleasant.{Z}

2856
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,290
{That's probably how a
right-minded person would think. - OG}I guess that's a normal reaction to this place.{Z}

2857
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,080
{But unfortunately, right-minded
people are rare in this town. - OG}But we don't often have
normal people in this town.{Z}

2858
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,420
{Well, the log will be stored
within four days or so. - OG}{Well, the log will change
in about four days. - Z}Well, the log registers in four days.{Nirm and Z}

2859
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,920
{So you should leave before you get into trouble. - OG}And then you should leave
before you find trouble.{Z}

2860
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,840
{Four days... Then we can't stay even two days. - OG}Four days...
We should only stay for two.{Z}

2861
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Hey, mister!

2862
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,090
{– Hey, old guy!
– Hey, buddy!- OG}– Hey, old guy!
– Hey, bub!{Z}

2863
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,850
Hm? What's wrong?
