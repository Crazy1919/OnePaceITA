00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,490
Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,880
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,260
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

{\an1}Translation & initial syncing
Vegapunk Fansubs

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,900
along the boundary between sky and sea.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,150
Now we're rowing our way

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,660

Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,220
raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,970
ring out.

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,130
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,430
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,810
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,450
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,660
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,000
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,670
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,920
{\an5}Already Negative!
Usopp's Courageous Stand!

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,700
Moriah's Dance Hall

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,700
Perona's room

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,700
Within Thriller Bark: The Mast Mansion

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,330
Usopp and Sanji fell below...

42
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,410
Are we just gonna leave them?

43
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,300
Yeah!

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
They'll be fine.

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,020
Anyway, we gotta find Moriah before he moves.

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,130
As soon as we find that giant leek I'll beat the hell out of him!

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,400
Got it!

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,820
That's the fastest way to solve all this trouble.

49
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,150
That's the entrance to the Dance Hall, where Luffy's shadow was taken!

50
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,850
And we last saw Moriah in the freezer room which is beyond it.

51
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,430
Alright!

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,910
You!

53
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,800
Did you defeat Perona?!

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,090
Hogback!

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,470
What's with this reindeer?

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,180
Is that Dr. Hogback?

57
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,680
He's the guy who was with Moria.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,850
Should I kick this guy's ass too?!

59
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,210
W-Wait a minute!

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,690
Wait, Luffy!

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,540
Why don't you leave this guy to me?

62
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,070
That's the doorway there, isn't it?

63
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,180
That's the freezer room.

64
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,370
Go ahead!

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,620
Alright! I got it!

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,310
Such a lack of manners, going to meet Moriah-sama without notice!

67
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,880
Cindry-chan! Get him!

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,540
Yes...

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,240
One!

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560
Two!

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,070
What?! Plates?

72
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,090
Thr-

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,140
What's wrong, Cindry-chan?!

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,600
Go ahead, Luffy.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,640
Thanks, Robin!

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,140
Wait, Straw Hat!

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,390
Hogback!

78
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,980
I'm disappointed in you!

79
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
I won't accept you as a doctor!

80
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,900
I couldn't recognize you, Dr. Chopper!

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,460
So you were a Zoan type user all along...

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,700
No wonder I thought you were a strange creature.

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,960
I have no idea how you avoided being carried through Perona's Garden, but...

84
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,970
You won't be escaping this time.

85
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,460
I'll take your shadow!

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,240
No...

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,590
Better yet...

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,560
How about I kill you here and turn you into a marionette?

89
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,450
They will do it.

90
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,340
This passage is incredibly long!

91
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,090
Alright! I'm out!

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,820
What's this place?

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,040
Found you!

94
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,970
Yo!

95
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,330
It's just you...

96
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,850
What's with this hugeness?!

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Is this some sort of archdemon?!

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,020
I've never seen a giant like this!

99
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,390
Is this a zombie?

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,560
Is this...

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,810
Luffy?

102
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,980
No use!

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,320
It's all over!

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,070
It came to kill us!

105
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,800
What is he planning to do?!

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,870
This looks good.

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,810
Alright! Now I'm all set!

108
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,400
I'll definitely be the Pirate King!

109
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,390
I was kinda surprised when the building collapsed.

110
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,740
W-What?

111
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,990
He didn't even notice us?!

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,250
That thing's speech sure resembles Luffy's...

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,050
Luffy's power certainly is dangerous when embedded in a body like that.

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,980
Let's just...

115
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,360
Forget your shadows...

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,050
Of course not!

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,280
Even if we give up our shadows, we haven't saved Nami-san yet!

118
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Pull it together!

119
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,900
In any case, getting past here is the problem...

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,820
It seems Usopp and I fell along with the stairs, but...

121
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,570
Even if we try to change our route...

122
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,060
This bridge has collapsed and we can no longer go to that mast-like mansion.

123
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,740
Jumping isn't an option either...

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,850
Our shortcut has turned into a detour infested with zombies...

125
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,400
Hang on thirty more seconds!

126
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,380
I'm not sure about this ornament.

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,630
He built a bridge!

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,970
All this rubble and wood is more than enough to build a bridge or two.

129
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,810
But despite this being an emergency, you gave it a lot of detail.

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,650
You expect me to make a shoddy job?!

131
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,820
No, this is just fine.

132
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,310
Anyway, you saved us. Let's go!

133
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,250
What's wrong with this room?

134
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Quite the eye-catching type of room.

135
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,800
I planned on having the zombies on the stairs and bridge make you their prey.

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,970
I didn't think Oars would fall down.

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,810
What a nosy nuisance.

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,480
Those ghosts...!

139
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,940
Is she... the one controlling them?

140
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,570
Who the hell is she?!

141
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,120
By now, you must be aware of how terrible these ghosts are!

142
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,460
Thanks to the Hollow Fruit I'm a ghost woman, capable of creating ghosts at will!

143
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,790
These ghosts are branches of myself.

144
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,420
They empty people's hearts.

145
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,160
This is it for you all!

146
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,140
I can't believe those troublesome ghosts are being controlled by that cutie-chan!

147
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,000
No time for that!

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,150
If we get hit by those things, we'll be done for sure!

149
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,860
There's no choice but to run!

150
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,340
They're certainly dangerous!

151
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,490
Negative Hollow!

152
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,130
My existence is worth less than a maggot's...

153
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,400
You're right...

154
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,420
I wish I were born a stray dog...

155
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,390
I don't deserve to walk on the same ground as all of you...

156
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,020
It's all... over...

157
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,720
Seize them.

158
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,780
How simple.

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,530
Only the ones above remain.

160
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,960
{Riot Shot: Salt Star!

161
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,530
Who is it?!

162
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,710
I won't let you...

163
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,590
Lay a hand on my crew!

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
Damn!

165
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,670
So he just pretended he was hit?

166
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,270
{Negative Hollow!

167
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,140
What?!

168
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,610
My name is...

169
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,110
Captain Usopp.

170
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,360
Why?!

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,400
Why isn't it affecting you?!

172
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,860
The ghost hit you!

173
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,620
What kind of trick did you use?!

174
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,580
It is no trick...

175
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,450
I've always been...!

176
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,470
Negative!

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,990
He's immune to the ghost's negative power!

178
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,720
What an incredible man!

179
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,730
That's not possible...

180
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,190
There's no way a man immune to the negative hollow can exist!

181
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,460
People cling to life.

182
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,740
That fact alone allows them to keep moving forward, and yet...

183
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,910
And yet... this man...

184
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,270
Do your best!

185
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,250
Fight!!

186
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,250
Do your best!!

187
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,180
Live!!!

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,250
Don't cheer me now!

189
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,250
Do your best!

190
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,350
Come on, snap out of it already!

191
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,920
Let's hurry and go rescue Nami and Brook!

192
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,820
You can't...

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,510
You can't expect to beat her with your inferior abilities.

194
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,140
I'll take care of her!

195
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,810
What's this reliant sensation...?

196
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,140
He wasn't affected...?

197
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,520
Curse you!

198
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,170
But... take care of the zombies around her!

199
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,820
God knows I can't beat them! I'd certainly die-

200
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,430
We'll leave it all to you!

201
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,150
What? Ah!

202
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,400
No-!

203
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,700
That's not-!

204
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,630
Wait a-!

205
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,500
I didn't-! I was-!

206
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,210
Wait a minute!

207
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,210
Wait!

208
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,330
Groom Absalom...

209
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,970
Do you take Nami as your wife, in sickness and health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?

210
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,990
I do!

211
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,680
And, Bride Nami...

212
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,440
Do you vow to love Absalom for all eternity?

213
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,110
Yes! I sure do!

214
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,360
I really love Ab-sama!

215
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,580
You may kiss the bride now.

216
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,050
No matter how you look at it, it's still impossible!

217
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,930
With this simultaneous attack, you'll lose your will to live for good!

218
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,160
{Fourfold Negative Attack...

219
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,520
{Negative Hollows!

220
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,320
They got him!

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,280
The four of them completely passed through him!

222
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,550
Ever since the creation of Thriller Bark...

223
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,270
There hasn't been anyone immune to the ghosts' depressing pow-

224
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,220
The negative ghosts...!

225
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,710
Have gone negative!

226
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,790
Kumashi, sorry for everything...

227
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,090
Even Perona-sama was affected!

228
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,160
Is that guy a holy man?!

229
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,640
He's a holy man, isn't he?!

230
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,740
Listen well, all of you...

231
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,140
When it comes to thinking negative...

232
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,400
There's no one who can surpass me!

233
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,070
Such confidence in something so useless!

234
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,840
Who'd have thought Usopp's negativity would be useful in such a place.

235
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,840
Perona's Wonder Garden

236
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,430
If he hadn't been there, we'd be dead by now.

237
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,770
What a terrifying ability he has.

238
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,480
I'll leave you here and head to where Nami-san is.

239
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,640
Got it!

240
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,840
Give it all you got!

241
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,190
Of course!

242
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,140
I'm the will-o'-wisp of love!

243
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,470
Nami-swan!

244
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,450
You won't be someone else's bride!

245
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,120
He jumped...

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,650
Is he even aware of how high we are?

247
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,320
Well...

248
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,810
The more your tension rises, the less pain you feel.

249
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,330
Anyway, we're heading to the top floor of that mansion!

250
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,000
Alright!

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,050
The skeleton must be there!

252
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,630
Just like the phoenix...

253
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,760
Then again, more like a zombie.

254
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
You shouldn't be able to stand anymore.

255
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,090
It is time I stop your movements for good.

256
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,600
So you never show up again to reclaim your shadow.

257
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,990
Would you like me to finish you off with my special "Arrow Notch Slash"?

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,800
You know nothing.

259
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,530
Don't use that name!

260
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,710
The name of the quick slash technique...

261
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,390
from the Surprise Attack Squad of the kingdom I came from is...

262
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,480
{\an8}Requiem: Type of song sung during funerals
Banderole: Horizontal fencing attack or banner

263
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,480
Requiem la Banderole.

264
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,300
And the alias my comrades gave to that sword technique, which they praised so much is...

265
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,490
Three-Pace Hum: Notch Slash!

266
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,850
Although you have my personality and skills, you've lost my memories and humanity.

267
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,980
So you have no right to use that name!

268
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,650
If you're the real one as you imply...

269
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,910
Then try to overcome my fake sword skills!

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,440
This is your last chance...

271
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,730
Three-Pace Hum...

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
Notch Slash!

273
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,700
Laboon!

274
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,460
More than anything, I'd like to apologize to you...

275
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,240
It has been fifty long years in this dark sea...

276
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,050
And yet...

277
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,260
There was no point in staying alive after all...

278
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,390
So lonely...

279
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,390
My life has been...

280
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
So lonely...

281
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,680
First...

282
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,620
Obviously, I'll get rid of that afro.

283
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,380
What?!

284
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,030
The mansion is shaking...!

285
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,680
Hey! What's with this shaking?!

286
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,060
Who knows...

287
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,030
Maybe an earthquake?

288
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,470
Is this the laboratory?!

289
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,810
Found him!

290
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,520
Hey! Skeleton!

291
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,110
You've been beaten up pretty badly.

292
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,480
Are you still in this world?!

293
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,590
Are you alive?!

294
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,340
Y-You...

295
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,450
Why are you here...?

296
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,760
Pathetic...

297
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,700
Pitying the loser after his defeat!

298
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
Hold on a second!

299
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,490
Are you...

300
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,670
The legendary samurai who is rumored to have sliced a dragon long ago?

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,670
I wanted to meet you.

302
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,490
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

303
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,330
Hey! Wait a minute!

304
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,890
What's this shaking?!

305
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,210
I can't kiss my bride!

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,110
Absalom-sama!

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,250
What?!

308
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,630
Did you find anything?!

309
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,280
This giant ship, Thriller Bark, is being sucked into a weird current!

310
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,720
The whole island is shaking!

311
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,790
How did this happen?!

312
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,470
It seems like... the Special Zombie is messing with the rudder.

313
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,580
What?!

314
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,000
It's moving! Moving!

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,140
General Zombies!

316
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,410
Set out immediately!

317
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,090
Stop Oars!

318
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,880
Roger!

319
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,390
Oars!

320
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,570
That's as far as you go, Special Zombie Oars.

321
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,000
Start cutting at his legs!

322
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,820
Where's Oars?

323
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,610
He's gone.

324
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,120
Being so huge...

325
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
How can he move so swiftly?

326
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,890
Found him!

327
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,460
Above!

328
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,390
Rubber...

329
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,710
(Even though I'm not rubber...)

330
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,370
Gatling!

331
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:14,150
Don't interfere with my adventure!

332
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,200
Annihilated?!

333
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,660
The ones who came from here?!

334
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,260
Y-Yes...

335
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,160
Everyone was crushed...

336
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,770
They're the ultimate Zombie Army of this island!

337
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,520
They're the General Zombies!

338
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,350
Yes, in a blink of an eye...

339
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,940
Impossible...

340
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,330
Isn't Oars supposed to be our ally?

341
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,550
Why is he rampaging mindlessly?

342
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,010
Zombies are supposed to do nothing but obey.

343
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,700
If we rely on such a guy,

344
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,890
There's no telling what'll happen to Thriller Bark!

345
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,730
Nami-swan!

346
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,730
I'm here to rescue you!

347
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,950
There she is!

348
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,570
One of the Straw Hats...?!

349
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,840
Amazing...

350
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,730
He pushed Ryuma away...

351
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,140
Who is he...?

352
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,520
Just a wild pirate swordsman who uses the Three Swords Style.

353
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,140
He's fairly strong.

354
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,680
If your pride allows it, he can take back your shadow for you...

355
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
What do you say?

356
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,900
My shadow...?!

357
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,130
Really...?!

358
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,700
I beg of you... please... recover my shad-

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
Shut up! Just be quiet!

360
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,250
Hey, skeleton!

361
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,350
You...

362
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,790
That's one fine blade you got there...

363
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,750
Good eye...

364
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,630
This certainly is one of the 21 Large Sharp Blades...

365
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,100
A black sword with a riot edge...

366
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,010
{\an8}Shusui: Autumn Water

367
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,010
The Wicked Clove... The famous sword, Shusui.

368
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,600
An item recognizable anywhere.

369
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,230
An Large Sharp Blade, huh?

370
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,250
