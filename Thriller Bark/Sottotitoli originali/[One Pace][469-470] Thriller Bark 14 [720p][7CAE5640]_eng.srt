Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,870
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,270
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,890
along the boundary between sky and sea.

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,160
Now we're rowing our way

If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,020
ring out.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,780
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,760
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,130
Get all the treasures

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,430
while laughing out loud.

28
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,800
Give them all out at a big party

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,470
making a splash...

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,720
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,060
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,390
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,730
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,900
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,170
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,560
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:39,230
{\an5}Show Yourselves, Straw Hat Pirates!
The Crew's Hopeless Counterattack!

39
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,910
Hey! What's wrong, Cindry-chan?!

40
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,180
My body...

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
Won't move.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,870
Tears came out...

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,760
Involuntarily.

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,610
Your body won't move?!

45
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,350
What the hell are you talking about?!

46
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,190
Stop that false crying already!

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,950
Who do you think you have to thank for moving as if you had a soul?!

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,120
You zombies only exist to obey your master's orders!

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,180
It's as if the owner of the body is fighting back...

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,860
Even though she died ten years ago...

51
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,320
Does a body without a soul have feelings...?

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,490
Probably...

53
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,810
Even if we investigated all the libraries in the world, we wouldn't find an answer.

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,660
I'll kill... you both...

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,240
That's it!

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,470
You've finally come to your senses, Cindry-chan!

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,640
Be sure to distract them until I'm out of here!

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,460
It's a shame...

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,860
Here I thought I was witness to a miracle...

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,140
Doce Fleur!

61
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,140
{\an8}Twelve Flowers

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,150
Wait!

63
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,000
W-What's with this shaking?!

64
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,280
Damn it!

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,850
You stupid pirate-deer! Acting like a person and siding with the dead!

66
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,790
You're not even human!

67
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,030
You stupid monster!

68
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,090
Our captain...

69
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,800
Doesn't care whether you're a monster, a cyborg, a pervert, a long-nose, or a moss head...

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
He can make anyone follow him!

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,660
Unlike you, who makes use of mindless corpses for your own schemes!

72
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,350
Let go of me, bastard!

73
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,510
Robin!

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,490
Alright, leave it to me!

75
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,720
{\an8}Leg Flower

76
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,720
Pierna Fleur!

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,970
Huh? What?!

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,080
W-Wait a minute, Dr. Chopper!

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,330
If you smash my head from such a high place...

80
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,380
The brain of the world's greatest genius would be destroyed!

81
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,920
Is that what you want?!

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,060
I'm fine with that.

83
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,960
Your head is more rotten than those zombies of yours!

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,330
Take this!

85
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,550
Robi-Cho Suplex!

86
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,910
Nearby, in the Special Freezer Room

87
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,670
{\an8}It's much bigger than a giant.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,680
So this is my zombie.

89
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,020
I've been expecting you, Oars!

90
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,110
The body and shadow have merged at last!

91
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,190
Are you a fully obedient zombie now?

92
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,110
Answer! Who is your master?

93
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,270
My Master is Moriah-sama.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,250
What?!

95
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,990
Hey, what're you saying?!

96
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,990
Are you really my shadow?!

97
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,460
Don't listen to him!

98
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,800
Who're you, straw hat guy?

99
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,200
Then, I shall give you your first order.

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,800
They are currently rampaging throughout every corner of Thriller Bark.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,740
Those are the Straw Hat Pirates.

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,030
Pulverize them without mercy, and send them back to their ship.

103
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,480
Whether they live or die, I don't care!

104
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,120
A little violence won't kill those over 100 million anyway.

105
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,880
Don't hold back!

106
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,670
Give them a taste of your power!

107
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,400
Yes, Moriah-sama.

108
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,590
Ah! Found you, Straw Hat.

109
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,270
See you later, Straw Hat!

110
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,740
You're not getting away!

111
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,210
Rubber...

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,170
W-W-Wait a minute!

113
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,210
That's dangerous!

114
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,730
Bell!

115
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,950
What?!

116
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,110
Luffy's zombie!

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,720
Oars!

118
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,660
The floor is crumbling!

119
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,290
Chopper, this way!

120
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,370
That was close.

121
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,590
So this is...

122
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,040
Luffy?

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,410
Both Hogback and Cindry fell to the floor below us.

124
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,650
Damn!

125
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,210
Too heavy!

126
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,180
Cindry-chan, move this rock...

127
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,600
C-Cindry-chan, quickly!

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Hurry up and help me!

129
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,890
Look, Oars is coming!

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,990
I...

131
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,200
I, the great genius...

132
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,310
I'm gonna get squished!

133
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,690
Hey, why're you just standing there?!

134
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm your master!

135
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,050
My body...

136
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,200
won't move.

137
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,820
What?!

138
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,330
Again with that ridiculous nonsense!

139
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,040
You zombies only exist to be loyal!

140
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,220
Quickly, help me!

141
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,360
You're nothing but a pretty face!

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
You worthless corpse!

143
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,410
Hey! Hurry up, Cindry!

144
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,800
Oars is here!

145
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,810
Oars, look down, you fool!

146
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,690
It's me, you ungrateful idiot!

147
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,840
I'm the one who fixed your body so you could move again!

148
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,300
Nearby, in the corridor outside Perona's room

149
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,620
{\an8}W-W-Wait a minute!

150
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,300
{\an8}W-What's going on?!

151
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,140
These tremors are completely different!

152
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,090
Lu-Lu-Lu...!

153
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,050
Luffy's zombie!

154
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,450
Nearby, in the church

155
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What's with this shaking?!

156
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,930
No way!

157
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,290
Luffy's zombie?!

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,930
Damn!

159
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,130
Nami-san, this isn't the time to be sleeping!

160
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,810
It can't be helped...

161
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,070
We need to escape.

162
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,270
Nami-san?

163
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,950
Nami-san disappeared.

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,280
Don't tell me...!

165
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,640
The tables have turned...

166
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,280
Bastard!

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,770
You're still conscious?!

168
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,030
You beast-man, show yourself!

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,470
It seems this demon has finally become our servant!

170
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,550
Checkmate!

171
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,070
This time the bride is mine!

172
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,080
Damn it!

173
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,460
Give back Nami-san!

174
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,380
Where are you hiding?!

175
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,280
I hope you have fun with the ultimate zombie!

176
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,120
Something came out!

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,780
T-That's...

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,020
A zombie!

179
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,810
It's Luffy's zombie.

180
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,380
Look over there!

181
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,630
The one who came out...!

182
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,650
Isn't that the curly cook?!

183
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,290
Damn!

184
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,730
Nami-san!

185
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,060
What is that stupid cook doing in there?!

186
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,250
Wait!

187
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,380
Moriah!

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,660
So you'd rather keep chasing me?

189
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,760
That huge copy bothers me, but...

190
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,830
If I want to recover everyone's shadows, I gotta beat the hell out of Moriah!

191
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,310
You're not getting away!

192
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,890
The Church

193
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,640
Look!

194
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,890
It is I who has the last laugh!

195
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,860
You seem to be deep asleep still...

196
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
I'll find us a new place...

197
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,150
And we shall have our wedding once again.

198
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,570
My silent bride.

199
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,830
Is Perona-sama okay?!

200
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,370
She has lost consciousness.

201
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,170
It seems she's not injured.

202
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,050
Commander Kumashi and the Vice-Commander are both wiped out.

203
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,100
That long-nose bastard!

204
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's get her outta here.

205
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,110
This mansion is so damn dangerous!

206
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,590
The special zombie will take revenge for us!

207
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,940
Get away from the mansion!

208
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,590
The special zombie is fighting!

209
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,230
He's so damn huge!

210
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,560
I can see his head towering over the mansion!

211
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,030
Perona's Wonder Garden

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Usopp!

213
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,200
Chopper!

214
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Robin!

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,970
W-W-We're in trouble!

216
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,920
A-A-Attached to Luffy's zombie's arm are...!

217
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,810
O-O-Our...!

218
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,410
Wanted posters!

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,250
He is...

220
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,040
Definitely after us!

221
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,490
Show yourselves!

222
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,430
Straw Hat Pirates!

223
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,310
That bastard...!

224
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,090
Now he's getting in our way!

225
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,100
That Luffy!

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,910
Does he really intend to destroy his own crew?!

227
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,320
He was surely ordered to.

228
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,470
I wonder if the real Luffy is alright...

229
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,920
What is that thing?!

230
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,370
Can we really beat such a monster?!

231
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,960
Interesting.

232
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,670
Wait, Moriah!

233
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,320
A dead end.

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:27,520
While you're here, all of your crewmates are becoming victims of your own power, Straw Hat!

235
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,280
What is that?!

236
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,110
Such a scary face!

237
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,140
That's...

238
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,870
Hey! Usopp! Is that you over there?!

239
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,910
Zoro!

240
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,640
What are you doing on the roof?!

241
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,710
Franky, Brook, you two are alright!

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,840
Hey! Step aside!

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Why're you getting in our way, Luffy?

244
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,790
Luffy...?

245
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,500
He is... my enemy.

246
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,300
My name is Oars.

247
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,520
Pleased to meet you!

248
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,480
He is provoking that monster.

249
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,400
That stupid cook...

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,450
Did he manage to save Nami at least?

251
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,190
Shouldn't you be more worried about yourself than the girl right now?

252
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,990
This is bad!

253
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,410
Sanji's in danger!

254
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,990
This is unexpected.

255
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,760
I thought they were merely after our shadows.

256
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,730
Maybe we caused a little too much trouble.

257
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,470
It seems they were only after Luffy's shadow.

258
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,620
Scary.

259
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
So scary!

260
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,480
We can't win against such a monster!

261
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,650
Your face resembles the one in this poster.

262
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,920
You're one of the pirates.

263
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,760
Rubber...

264
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,080
Luffy's technique!

265
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,560
Is he going to stretch?!

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Is he also a rubberman?!

267
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,860
Scythe!

268
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,520
He didn't stretch, but...!

269
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,440
With that range and destructive power, there's no need!

270
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,240
Oars...

271
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,080
I've heard that name before...

272
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,130
Is he the demon Oars, the legendary "Nation Snatcher"?

273
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,240
Collier Frit!

274
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,240
{\an8}Fried Neck

275
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,360
Sanji!

276
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,370
So huge, yet so fast.

277
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,680
This is bad!

278
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,770
He'll die!

279
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,380
Hey! Stop!

280
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,980
Sanji!

281
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,710
Disappear, little pirate!

282
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,820
Firebird Star!

283
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,460
Sanji!

284
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,070
He's heading over here!

285
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,970
This is bad!

286
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,310
Franky, lure him over here!

287
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,100
Got it!

288
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,400
Take this, monster!

289
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,260
Watch out!

290
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,560
You two, head to the lower roof!

291
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,990
One Gorilla.

292
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,190
Two Gorilla!

293
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,880
Three Swords Style....

294
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,300
Two-Gorilla Beheading!

295
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,510
Rubber...

296
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,810
Volcano!

297
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,540
Zoro! Are you okay?!

298
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,700
He'll die if he falls from such a height!

299
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,420
Take this, monster!

300
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,260
Weapons Left!

301
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,400
What incredible agility!

302
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,280
He avoided it again!

303
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,960
Franky!

304
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,340
Brook!

305
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,880
Zoro's coming down!

306
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,180
Cien Fleur!

307
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,180
{\an8}One Hundred Flowers

308
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,980
Spider Net!

309
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,290
Damn!

310
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,760
Take this!

311
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,360
You're a zombie too!

312
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,920
Deadly... Salt Star!

313
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,150
It... It's not enough for that huge body!

314
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,620
Heavy Gong!

315
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
D-Damn you...

316
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,700
Luffy...

317
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,770
I don't know you guys.

318
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,790
I am Moriah-sama's servant...

319
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,730
Oars!
