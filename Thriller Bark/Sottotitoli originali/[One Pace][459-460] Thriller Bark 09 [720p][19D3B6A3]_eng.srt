That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090

Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,660
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,860
Settle down!

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,220
Moriah isn't here!

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,900
Is this...?

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,970
The Sunny.

45
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,770
The Sunny?!

46
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,150
Why're we back here?

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,050
No, but...

48
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,450
I'm not dreaming.

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,340
I've lost my shadow!

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,700
What a weird feeling.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,900
Hey, big trouble!

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,180
Life or death situation!

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,850
There's no food left!

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,750
The only provisions we had are gone.

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,380
They took all the food we've been stocking.

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,390
Cheese and crackers are not enough for me!

57
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,300
Meat!

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,950
How shameful...

59
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,720
I let my guard down.

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,940
I even lost my pirate lunch...

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,650
Cheese is not enough... not enough...

62
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,110
By the way,

63
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,190
I don't see Nami-san anywhere.

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,600
She was kidnapped?!

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,790
Why didn't you chase her to the end of the earth?!

66
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,430
I-I'm sorry.

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,410
But, we were in a critical situation and we couldn't go after her.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,370
Who and where the hell is he?!

69
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,540
I'll go save her this instant!

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,960
W-Wait!

71
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Let me explain everything first.

72
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,900
Listen, I'll make it short.

73
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Right now, there are two things we must get back no matter what!

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,470
Food.

75
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,090
Nami.

76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,110
Then our shadows, right?

77
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,970
That's three.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,350
That's not how you're supposed to rank them.

79
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,190
First, let me explain about Nami and the shadows.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,130
Ma-!

81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,260
Marry?!

82
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,840
Don't mess around!

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,740
So damn unforgivable!

84
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,270
He sure is brave to marry Nami.

85
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,770
And also, I'm a giant?!

86
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,710
They made such a zombie?!

87
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,430
So, Luffy's and the cook's zombies have been confirmed, Usopp?

88
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,740
I never thought he was one of the Seven Warlords...

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,390
I'm scared all of a sudden.

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,720
You didn't know?

91
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,460
I see.

92
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,400
If zombies resemble oneself, then...

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,670
I've also seen Zoro's zombie.

94
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,330
What's he like?

95
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,040
He was just like you.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,650
He was wearing wooden clogs so, I knew it wasn't you.

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,010
Well, it doesn't matter.

98
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,670
If we find those three zombies and throw salt in their mouths, we'll get our shadows back, right?

99
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,120
Anyway, good thing you found such a weakness.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,050
The one who told us about their weakness and told us to come here and rescue you... was that skeleton.

101
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,760
You met Brook?!

102
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah, we did.

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
And I asked him a foolish question shortly afterwards...

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,730
To be honest, the first time you said he'd tag along as one of our friends, I completely disagreed.

105
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:46,110
The more I talked with that clattering skeleton, I realized he really has bones.

106
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,410
Although he's a skeleton.

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,870
He's a real man!

108
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,240
Wait a minute!

109
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,290
While we're still at it, just answer me one more question.

110
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,150
If you go out in public with that look of yours, you know how people will react, right?

111
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,400
You're a talking skeleton, you know.

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,080
There's no way someone will befriend a guy with such evil looks.

113
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,290
Hideous things always get despised.

114
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,930
Franky, what're you...?

115
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,530
Even if you manage to escape this cursed sea...

116
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,240
You're aware of your fate.

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,460
Decades of despair, unable to escape...

118
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,070
You said you were so lonely you wished to die, right?

119
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,410
If I were you, I'd no longer cling to life.

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,870
Having such insignificant existence and acting all chivalrous all the time...

121
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,840
Just tell us what're you hiding already.

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,800
To go that far... what do you want to achieve?

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,180
What is that promise you made to your friends that you talk about?

124
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,100
You're a very nosy person.

125
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,440
It's simple.

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,740
Long ago, our pirate crew left one of our friends behind at a certain place.

127
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,150
It was a very painful farewell, but...

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,150
As our ship departed, we promised we'd return no matter what.

129
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,870
Then, we were annihilated on this sea...

130
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,780
In order to not leave our promise unfulfilled....

131
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,730
As the only member of the crew who has lived long enough, I have the duty to inform him of these events.

132
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,730
Since the day of our deaths...

133
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,760
It's been 50 years I presume.

134
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,320
50 years?!

135
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,100
Hey! That was too long ago! I wasn't even born yet!

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,350
Sorry to say but, there's no way that guy could've waited such a long time!

137
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,320
Why would he wait for me?

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,610
He has the right to leave and not be kept waiting.

139
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,090
If by any chance he believed in our promise and has been waiting this whole time...

140
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,020
I can't imagine how lonely he must feel...

141
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,370
If he's been waiting this whole time while thinking we betrayed him...

142
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,270
I can't imagine how miserable he must feel!

143
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,210
You...

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,010
The name of the friend to whom we swore to meet again on that cape is...

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,390
Laboon.

146
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,300
We couldn't take a little whale on our dangerous journey...

147
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,220
Take care, Laboon! {I cant understand this so i kinda randomly timed it.. check it please-campa}

148
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,150
We'll definitely come back for you!

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,760
I suppose he must've grown a lot by now...

150
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,330
Is your friend...

151
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,500
A whale...?

152
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,420
Correct.

153
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,540
I can't help but think he has believed in us since then.

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,420
He might be thinking that we'd play our cheerful music as always...

155
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,500
And return for him with open arms.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,480
I cannot ask for forgiveness after we died so irresponsibly.

157
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,990
I cannot call him from the afterlife, after our reckless promise...

158
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,290
Dying is not an excuse...!

159
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,540
Because a man once said that they would return no matter what!

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,590
That's how it is.

161
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,800
Laboon...

162
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,510
Are you serious?!

163
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,180
It's him...

164
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,110
We've met...

165
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,900
that whale.

166
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,580
You know him?

167
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,390
Why...?

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,040
What do you mean?

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,510
The Twin Capes located at the entrance of the Grand Line.

170
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,610
That's where we met that huge whale.

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,700
It kept bumping it's head against the Red Line, the wall which divides the world.

172
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,780
For 50 years, it waited for its pirate friends who promised to return after doing a lap around the world.

173
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,090
Somehow, Luffy stopped its suicidal habit of hitting itself against that wall.

174
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,600
It still lives...

175
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,540
And keeps waiting for its friends at those capes.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,610
What an amazing story...

177
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,050
Both of them have kept the promise they made 50 years ago!

178
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,100
So, one of the friends Laboon has been waiting for is...

179
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,870
That skeleton.

180
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,330
If you became stronger in these past 5 years...!

181
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,930
I have as well!

182
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,990
That's because our thoughts are the same!

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,800
As always, you keep treasuring that afro.

184
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
You won't be able to protect such a huge weak point forever.

185
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,310
Shut up!

186
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
Laboon...

187
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,230
Do you still remember us?

188
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,040
Whenever I think of how you must feel...

189
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,820
It makes my heart ache...

190
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,830
Although I don't have a heart now!

191
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,810
We were unable to overcome the challenges of the Grand Line.

192
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,670
Our friends have all died.

193
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,670
As for myself...

194
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,080
Not only have I lost my friends...

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,880
My face, my body... I've lost everything...

196
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,290
If we ever meet again...

197
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,770
You won't recognize me in the skeleton shape I am now...

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,620
Stop!

199
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Not the afro!

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,420
I have nothing left, but...

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,580
At least... I have this head that looks like Laboon which amused everyone!

202
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,080
Are you brothers?

203
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,280
I'll protect it with my life...!

204
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,070
And we'll definitely meet again...

205
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,850
Please wait for me...

206
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,100
At the promised...

207
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,540
Capes...

208
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,670
Now I love both the skeleton and the whale, damn it!

209
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,900
Shut up!

210
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,310
Now I've made up my mind!

211
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,070
He's a musician...!

212
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,860
A talking skeleton...!

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,450
Has an afro...!

214
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,310
That Yohoho thing...!

215
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,190
And he's Laboon's friend!

216
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Even if I have to drag him, I'll make him board this ship!

217
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,660
I'll make him our crewmate!

218
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,740
Do you have any objections?!

219
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,450
Would you change your mind even if we had any?

220
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,100
I really want him to see Laboon again!

221
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,500
Completely agreed, damn it!

222
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,370
Me too, you bastards!

223
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm no longer afraid of skeletons!

224
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,980
Now that we're fully aware of the situation...

225
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,760
I'll personally go prevent Nami-san from getting married!

226
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,870
Hey, Zoro!

227
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,760
Where are you going?

228
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,970
Let's get going already.

229
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,680
We gotta recover an extra shadow now, don't we?

230
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,630
Alright!

231
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,960
Men, get ready to counterattack!

232
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,990
We're pulverizing Thriller Bark!

233
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,030
Good luck!

234
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,610
You're coming too, idiot!

235
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,500
Anyway, it won't be easy to find the zombies that have our shadows.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,420
Also,

237
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,280
Luffy's zombie is extremely huge!

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,440
It's bigger than two giants!

239
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
You can't hope to beat that thing!

240
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,900
We don't need to search for the zombies.

241
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,260
Though, I wanna see mine.

242
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,880
What're you talking about?!

243
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,730
If we stay like this, we'll never get close to the sunlight again.

244
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,890
But, don't you remember...?

245
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,460
The old zombie man said it, didn't he?

246
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,880
I just saw you...

247
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,800
You're terribly strong!

248
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,390
So...

249
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,660
What request?

250
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,790
I want you to beat a certain man...

251
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm sure you can do it!

252
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,500
Despite the number of victims, if you beat him, everyone will be saved!

253
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,550
If we take out Gekko Moriah, everyone's shadows will return!

254
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,970
H-He did say that...

255
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,220
There he goes again... right to the point...

256
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,990
Then...

257
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,910
If we climb those stairs, we'll find Moriah, right?

258
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,980
Certainly!

259
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,660
Anyway...

260
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,150
I'll go kick Gekko Moriah's ass!

261
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,080
Since that'll bring everyone's shadows back...

262
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,010
Sanji, I'll leave Nami up to you.

263
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,760
But of course!

264
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,420
I don't care whether he is an invisible man or a ceramic man!

265
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,390
I'll kick the hell out of him right through the other side of this fog!

266
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,080
Like I'd let that wedding take place!

267
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,400
Ah, I forgot to mention it, but that invisible man saw Nami completely naked in the bathroom.

268
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,630
Whaaaat?!

269
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,300
Bastard!

270
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,950
Don't keep angering him...

271
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,020
He might transform into something.

272
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,980
I feel guilty for letting Nami get kidnapped right before my eyes.

273
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,050
I'll go with Sanji too!

274
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,820
But mostly it's because I don't wanna come across that Warlord again!

275
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,080
That skeleton's fight worries me.

276
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,510
I'll go there.

277
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,540
If Straw Hat beats Moriah first, that'd solve one problem but...

278
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,500
Until that happens, getting killed by his own shadow is a serious matter.

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,060
I'll accompany you there, Franky.

280
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,670
I'm curious about how strong this so called "Legendary Samurai" zombie is.

281
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,860
Nami-chan and Skeleton-san...

282
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,010
For the time being they're our priority.

283
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,180
After that, defeating Moriah is definitely the key to victory.

284
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,450
It's not as simple as you say.

285
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,310
Our enemy is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

286
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,700
No problem.

287
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,290
Crocodile was too.

288
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,190
No problem?!

289
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,450
You were nearly killed!

290
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,930
I beg of you, be careful!

291
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,650
Especially since... I know I already said it, but your zombie is terribly huge!

292
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,370
Alright, alright.

293
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,960
Then, take this.

294
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,210
Carry one bag at least.

295
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,400
It's my Special Zombie-Purifying Salt Ball.

296
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,710
Ah, so this is what you were making a while ago.

297
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,950
Pretty clever.

298
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,690
Anyway...

299
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,390
I've got a word of advice for you all.

300
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,850
No matter how thick the fog is within this sea...

301
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,520
There's no guarantee sunlight won't get through it!

302
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,400
We're only safe because it's midnight!

303
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,630
In other words, when the sun arises at daybreak, that's our ultimate time limit!

304
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
That goes without saying!

305
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,220
Reaching daybreak without tasting food is the worst!

306
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,210
We'll make you regret having messed with us!

307
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,750
Gekko Moriah!

308
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,760
We'll take twice the food that was stolen...!

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,180
Before daybreak!

310
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,950
No, you see... that's not it...

311
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,010
I mean the limit to recover our shad-

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,010
Let's go!

313
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,640
Yeah!

314
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,790
Nami-swan!

315
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,640
Wait a-

316
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,320
Do as you wish then!

317
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm coming to rescue you!

318
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,380
Amazing!

319
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,420
So this is a ship!

320
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,160
The sea looks awful...

321
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,030
But my future looks great!

322
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,510
Alright, I'll become the Pirate King with this ship!

323
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,080
Where's Oars right now?

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,210
He climbed to the top of the mast, Master.

325
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,410
But... but... Master!

326
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:21,130
We can't just sit around doing nothing while such a huge zombie wanders aimlessly around the island!

327
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,550
That guy is terribly dangerous!

328
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,840
Don't worry.

329
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,850
It's just a matter of time.

330
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:34,310
Now that we have Oars, we'll be able to steal the shadows of much stronger warriors.

331
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,570
From now on, we'll have Special Zombies coming one after another!

332
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,330
We'll need stronger marionettes it seems, Hogback.

333
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,720
Leave it to me!

334
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,590
H-Hogback-sama!

335
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,570
We're in trouble!

336
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,060
The pirates...!

337
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,050
What's wrong, Hildon?

338
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:08,370
The three whose shadows were stolen woke up at the ship and are heading this way with their friends!

339
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,140
What?!

340
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,560
Those who get their shadows stolen can't wake up that quick!

341
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,470
T-Their friends found a way to wake them!

342
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,280
It seems they have some connection with the Humming One!

343
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,700
Perhaps, that man told them what he knew!

344
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,390
All of the pirates knowing how to purify the zombies is proof!

345
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,120
W-What'd you say?!

346
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,080
The zombies fear the pirates...

347
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,410
Currently, they're running from place to place...

348
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,950
The Wild Zombies, Surprise Zombies and Soldier Zombies, couldn't lay a hand on them...

349
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,300
Even before the pirates knew about the salt!

350
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,640
Deploy the General Zombies!

351
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,650
They'll take care of the pirates as long as they don't swallow salt!

352
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,940
And what the hell is Absalom doing?!

353
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,840
Well... you see...

354
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,500
His wedding is about to start right now...

355
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,280
Most of the general zombies are in attendance.

356
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,660
What are those fools doing?!

357
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Come to think of it, he asked if Hogback-sama could give one of his belly dances at the reception in 1 hour.

358
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,170
You're right...

359
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,410
A wedding ceremony is a once in a lifetime memorial event.

360
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,720
That'd be one funny dance-

361
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,600
Like I'd do that now!

362
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,580
Cancel that wedding this instant!

363
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,610
I'm a simple zombie...

364
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,980
I can't go against Absalom-sama...

365
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,300
No need to rely on that beast.

366
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,910
If my ghosts weaken them, the Soldier Zombies will be more than enough to capture them.

367
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,330
Don't panic just because they know the zombies' weakness.

368
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,600
I'll capture every single one of them, so...

369
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,130
Prepare some marionettes for the shadows of the remaining pirates.

370
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm going back to my room.

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
Let's go, Kumashi.

372
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,100
Right away...

373
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,630
That's true.

374
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,040
How reliable.

375
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,050
I expect no less from the Ghost Princess.

376
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,510
What?

377
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,760
It would be best if you learned...

378
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,820
From Kumashi's example.

379
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,960
Anyway...

380
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
Everything will be fine, Moriah-sama.

381
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
Is that so?

382
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,220
How boring...

383
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,050
Again...?

384
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,330
In any case, you won't have to do anything.

385
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,980
I'll stay here a bit longer.

386
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,750
Oars amuses me more right now.

387
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,510
Then, I have a request.

388
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,050
Since Absalom isn't doing anything, I'd like to take command of just two zombies if it's possible.

389
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,240
They're here!

390
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,060
Where's Moriah?!

391
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Here they come!

392
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,040
Get outta my way!

393
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,800
Give back the food!

394
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Who's the damn bastard who peeked while Nami-san was in the shower?!

395
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,220
Show yourself!

396
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,950
It seems we won't be needing salt for now...

397
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,730
They're rampaging with absolute fury.

398
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,670
I wonder if they even care about the shadows...

399
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,860
C-Commander! There are five people heading for the Dance Hall!

400
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
And we can't handle the two on the bridge below!

401
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
Moriah's Dance Hall

402
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
Perona's Room

403
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
Wonder Garden

404
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
{\an6}Heading to
Moriah's
Dance Hall

405
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
{\an6}Heading to
Perona's
Room

406
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,580
It angers me just thinking about me being caught by these weaklings!

407
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,420
If you're so grateful that I freed you, you can start calling me "big bro" if you want.

408
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,420
Like hell!

409
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,780
Oh no! This is bad!

410
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,400
What? What's wrong?

411
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
It's all over...

412
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,750
If I were to be reborn, I would want to be a maggot...

413
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,910
I have such large eyebrows... I'm better off dead...

414
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,950
Hey! Luffy, Sanji!

415
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,500
What's wrong with you?!

416
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,080
Robin, what's going on?

417
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,020
It's the ghosts doing!

418
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,460
When you touch them, you lose your will to live.

419
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,340
We haven't found a countermeasure to it...

420
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,970
Alright! I got you now!

421
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,340
Lead Star!

422
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,500
Hurry up!

423
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,580
If they get us too, it'll be over!

424
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,730
The ghosts have almost caught up with us!

425
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,200
No! If we all get caught, it's over!

426
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,610
Set sail! Set sail!

427
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,290
We're falling!

428
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,670
Usopp!

429
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,710
Sanji!

430
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,930
That just now...

431
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,490
No way, that's impossible...

432
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,340
That surprised me.

433
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,300
The stairs are gone!

434
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,480
W-W-What's wrong?!

435
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,260
W-What happened?

436
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,080
The zombies, Usopp and Sanji...

437
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,200
Everyone fell down.

438
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Leaving aside the fact that these two fell down...

439
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,690
What's the meaning of this?

440
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,270
Our path was suddenly blocked.

441
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,710
What's with that wall?

442
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,360
Damn it...!

443
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,800
What the hell happened...?

444
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
Just now...?

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,730
It isn't stone.

446
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,850
Weapons Left!

447
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,690
What?!

448
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,110
What're you doing?!

449
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,400
A huge wall suddenly appeared.

450
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,130
Idiot! That's no wall!

451
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,970
That's Luffy's zombie!

452
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,010
What?!
