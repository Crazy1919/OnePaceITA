00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,880
raising our battle cry.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,260
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,260
raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,600
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,010
ring out.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,610
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,510
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,130
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,390
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,810
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,480
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,660
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,000
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,670
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

{\an5}Perona's Wonder Garden and
the Charge of the General Zombies!

38

No matter where they try to run, track them down and drag them here!

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,140
No one can match the Zombie Generals!

40
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,650
Hey, stop wasting time, Captain John.

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,660
You're really not living up to your lifetime's infamous reputation.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,510
Okay, okay. I'm going.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,570
Geez... he never changes...

44
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,030
Ab-sama...

45
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,560
Marry me!

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
Lola!

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,170
You...! Go and fight this instant!

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,620
I'm your commander here!

49
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,840
Then, marry me.

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,620
Why would I?!

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,980
Lola... what're you...?!

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,160
Aren't you gonna listen to the Grave Ab-sama orders?!

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,690
Then, marry me!

54
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,780
Stop joking!

55
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm a human!

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,900
I need to have a human bride!

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,690
Hey, Lola... think about it.

58
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,330
You're a female warthog zombie.

59
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,370
You're dead and rotting!

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,780
Stop it!

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,410
Hey, what a terrifying method!

62
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,820
Isn't that a marriage certificate?!

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,040
To think you're forcing me to marry you!

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I can't resist that wild muzzle of yours.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,140
Absalom, give me your finger.

66
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,880
I love you!

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,350
Don't mess around!

68
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,760
I don't wanna spend my days being haunted by a dead animal!

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,100
Bridal Arts...

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,640
Oath Kiss!

71
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,410
Wait, Lola!

72
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,570
Listen carefully.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,580
I've already...

74
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,960
I've already chosen the woman who'll be my bride!

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,310
She certainly has a strong temper, but she's a weak, flesh and blood woman in the end!

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,130
You'll fail again anyways.

77
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,160
Idiot, look!

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,710
She's one of the pirates who landed on this island, perfectly suited to become this handsome man's bride.

79
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,410
I won't let it happen!

80
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,420
That woman...

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,740
I'll get rid of her!

82
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,120
Wait!

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,800
Lola!

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,210
Hey, Kumashi!

85
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,600
Kumashi!

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
The Risky Brothers are bringing a coffin here.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,590
When you receive it, send it to the master's Dance Hall!

88
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,320
Is that clear?

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
Is that clear or not?!

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,090
Yes...

91
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,240
Don't answer, it's not cute!

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,120
From now on, I'll be commanding the treasure collecting group toward the ship.

93
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,290
If anything happens, come and tell me, got it?

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,960
That's it, when you don't say anything, you're so cute!

95
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,330
H-Have a nice trip...

96
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,040
You! You talked just now!

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,620
Take it there! Take it there! To the master's lair!

98
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh no! We dropped it!

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,940
Oh no! We broke it!

100
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,250
The delivery for our master!

101
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,240
The coffin opened up!

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,540
Where am I?

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,250
He's awake!

104
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,870
Damn it!

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,920
Hurry and hit him! Beat him to death!

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,090
Killing is bad!

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,080
Then, half-kill!

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,210
Half-kill!

109
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,480
Usopp!

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Nami!

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Hey, hang in there!

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,510
Wake up!

113
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,850
The samurai... certainly...

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,060
Did he strike us with the back of the blade?

115
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,270
It seems it was raining here.

116
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,980
The ground is a little wet.

117
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,240
Where are we?

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
I don't know, but...

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,170
Just now those squirrels were carrying us to be delivered in that coffin.

120
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,800
Isn't this an iron coffin?!

121
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,490
Oh no, those three are awake!

122
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,450
This is bad. Call our comrades!

123
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,720
It looks like... we're currently behind the mansion.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,960
Hogback's laboratory was on the top floor.

125
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
They've already carried us a long way it seems.

126
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,880
Hey, look behind you!

127
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,970
There's a sturdy building on the opposite side!

128
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,800
What's that?

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,500
There was such a huge building behind the mansion all this time?

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,260
I've figured out where we are!

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,650
What is it?

132
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,060
What do you mean?

133
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,240
We're on the passage that connects the mansion to that huge building.

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,850
Passage?

135
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,350
It's so wide, almost like a forest.

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:22,460
Even if it's been made a forest, they were carrying our coffin here while we were unconscious.

137
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,640
That means, they had to have been carrying us to that building.

138
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,650
That's probably the place where zombies are made.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,700
I'm glad we woke up!

140
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,340
Let's run!

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,360
That's right! Let's run, right away!

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,270
Wait a minute!

143
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,730
We didn't get any treasure because we got scared and started running around screaming...

144
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,430
Is that alright?

145
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,260
What're you thinking, idiot?!

146
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,650
My "Something is wrong"-sensor is having a huge response!

147
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,830
Let's just run away, Nami!

148
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,600
That's right! That's right!

149
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,430
I clearly remember what the zombie said back then.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,420
Let's run! Let's run!

151
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,750
What a shame!

152
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,930
The treasure storehouse isn't here!

153
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,710
Stop thinking useless stuff, let's run!

154
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,630
Let's run, Nami!

155
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,630
How stupid!

156
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,510
I finally understand! I was just too scared at the time!

157
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,160
Weird looking eyes!

158
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,630
Then, where do we run?

159
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,290
Forward?

160
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,100
Back?

161
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,530
That's one hard decision.

162
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,620
If we go back to the mansion, we'll most likely run into that samurai again.

163
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,840
But, we might run into scarier guys if we head forward.

164
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,690
What're these little animals?

165
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,240
Penguins?

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,930
Numbers!

167
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,540
One!

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,470
Two!

169
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,660
Three!

170
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,670
No...

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,090
Greetings, we're...!

172
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,720
The Penguin Zombie Combi-

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Ah, I got it wrong.

174
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,560
Trio! We're a trio!

175
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,630
I'm the new guy!

176
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,170
Like we care about that kinda member info!

177
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,970
And behind you all are...

178
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,620
No way...

179
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
Our comrades, the Wild Zombies!

180
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,310
Welcome to Perona-sama's Wonder Garden!

181
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,940
More strange creatures came out!

182
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Alright then, let's get 'em!

183
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,630
Usopp!

184
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,480
Fire!

185
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,580
Fire?

186
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,540
Use fire! These guys are zombies!

187
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,400
Deadly...

188
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,670
Usopp!

189
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,150
Chopper!

190
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,660
Watch out, behind you!

191
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,660
Usopp...

192
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,330
Chopper...

193
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,190
You're in the same situation!

194
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,200
Stop!

195
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,540
Bastard! What're you doing to your comrade!

196
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,440
Your enemy is that woman!

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
She's the one you should beat!

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,120
I have no idea who this lady might be or where she came from...

199
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,260
But even if it goes against master's orders...

200
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,240
Even if I die...

201
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,180
I won't hurt a woman!

202
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,430
If you've a problem with that, bring it on!

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,810
Damn Zombies!

204
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,120
Hey! What's wrong?!

205
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,250
Hey Piglet!

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,180
You did something again, didn't you?!

207
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,280
Spit it out!

208
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,090
I told you from the start that I don't know anything.

209
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,830
And you're laughing now.

210
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,240
What an obvious fella.

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,610
How strange...

212
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,700
Not even a scream.

213
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,770
I wonder if they were strangled to death...

214
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,710
Why is your train of thought always so dark?!

215
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,860
How weird...

216
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,760
Even Zoro's disappeared.

217
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,400
Where did they go?!

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,950
It can't be helped with Zoro and Sanji!

219
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,930
What're you doing at a time like this?!

220
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,780
Hey! I found the armor lying in there!

221
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,260
Isn't it a man's romance to wear it?!

222
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,190
No way!

223
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,480
R-Romance?!

224
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
Of course!

225
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,180
When you gained that iron body, did you change your heart to iron as well?

226
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,860
Please forgive me!

227
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,450
I never intended to go so far as to change my heart to iron!

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,670
When you lose something important, a foreboding wind blows through your heart.

229
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,040
Please listen...

230
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,060
"The Heart of a Steely Cyborg Traveler"

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,330
Are these guys aware of the current situation?

232
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,960
Hey.

233
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,380
We've come to a large hall.

234
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,090
Really?

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,470
Robin, are Usopp and the others there?!

236
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,170
I don't think so.

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,990
This hall's interior looks like the outside...

238
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,600
What's with this place?!

239
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,570
It's as if it were an arena.

240
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,530
It's not that simple.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You better resign yourselves.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,620
It's impossible for you to escape from here!

243
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,630
Franky!

244
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,230
Who is it?!

245
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,140
A moving suit of armor!

246
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,810
No doubt it's a zombie.

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,520
It's moving even with those spears in its body.

248
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,950
Just 'cause zombies are well equipped...

249
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,360
I won't be scared...!

250
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,510
Strong Right!

251
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,250
The wall was...!

252
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,050
Since it uses fencing...

253
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,310
Weapons Left!

254
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,320
Franky was...!

255
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,110
It'll take more than that to kill me!

256
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,600
Especially for a corpse like you!

257
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,730
He's still getting up.

258
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,480
The latch won't open.

259
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,800
He's completely different from the zombies we've seen so far.

260
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,180
Soon you'll understand!

261
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,470
That's what makes them really terrifying!

262
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,720
That guy, speaking from that far!

263
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,900
They don't feel pain!

264
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,870
Every single one of those armed General Zombies made a name for themselves in battle.

265
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,150
They're unbending warriors!

266
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,130
The leader of a country's knights who turned into a brutal criminal.

267
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,790
A legendary samurai, a pirate, a gunslinger!

268
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,590
Imagine those men after they've become invulnerable!

269
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,940
There's no way someone like you could beat them!

270
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,590
Even now your friends are in peril!

271
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,350
Serves you right!

272
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,250
You bastard!

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,710
Wall zombie!

274
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,690
Got it!

275
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
He's closed off the path!

276
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,430
That's not the only path that was closed.

277
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,350
Speaking from my experience...

278
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,470
This will be more than just tough.

279
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,090
It's full of armor!

280
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,570
There's no point in fighting them one by one, as our attacks don't harm them.

281
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,910
And we'll just be overwhelmed if we try to face them all straight on.

282
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,710
I see.

283
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,790
You're right, it's not like this is our last battle.

284
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,750
If we run straight ahead from this hall, we'll probably reach the courtyard.

285
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,930
Alright! Then, the three of us will meet up in there.

286
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,620
Be careful not to let anyone else disappear.

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,570
Of course.

288
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,950
Get 'em!

289
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,990
Let's go!

290
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,870
Move!

291
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,220
Phoenix of the Thirty-six Earthly Desires!

292
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
This technique...!

293
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,950
Zoro!

294
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,910
A scar on the back is a shame for a warrior!

295
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,950
Yet I'm covered with scars!

296
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,280
Who're you?

297
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,270
I thought you were Zoro.

298
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,920
My name is Jigoro!

299
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,460
You're exactly like him!

300
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,010
This is what you use against zombies!

301
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,040
Fresh Fire!

302
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,340
Prepare the buckets!

303
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,710
What?!

304
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,190
Once Fleur!

305
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,190
{\an8}Eleven flowers

306
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,710
Slam!

307
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,180
Where's Luffy?!

308
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,230
It seems he hasn't come out yet.

309
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,620
Even if we went back, it'd be hard to find that idiot because he's wearing that armor!

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,010
Could he have disappeared as well?!

311
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,420
But we can't patiently wait for him.

312
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,970
The zombies will be here in no time!

313
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,930
Hey! Straw Hat!

314
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,460
That hurt, bastard! Let me out!

315
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,820
What the...?

316
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,520
Bastards, let me out, damn it!

317
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,800
It's not fun, damn it!

318
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Open the lid!

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,530
A-A coffin?!

320
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,670
Let me out immediately!

321
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,440
Let me out, I'll kick your ass!

322
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,530
That voice just now...!

323
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,100
Let me out!

324
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,430
Hey, I'm telling you to let me out!

325
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,830
Luffy!

326
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,620
No way...!

327
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,440
Is Straw Hat inside of that thing?!

328
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,520
After him, Nico Robin!

329
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,280
What the hell is he doing?!

330
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,580
He let himself get caught!

331
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,220
Straw Hat!

332
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,560
You're not following him!

333
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,370
Hey, hey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

334
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,860
I'm the widely rumored Spider Monkey!

335
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,480
A gigantic spider!

336
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,530
This thing's size exceeds that of average insects! It's a monstrous spider!

337
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,830
Let me out I tell you, idiot!

338
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,420
Open the li-

339
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,710
Ah! Another one.

340
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,310
Damn, the coffin...!

341
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,060
Bastard, what're you gonna do with him?!

342
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,830
Don't worry.

343
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,350
Whatever happens to him, you will also learn firsthand.

344
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,090
You should be worrying about yourselves...

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,140
Before you is me, and behind you are the armored soldiers!

346
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,810
With this your crew will be...

347
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,800
Annihilated!
