And go find the thing we're looking for... One Piece!

and go find the thing we're looking for...

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,940
A pocket of coins, and

We are!

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,710
Let's break the tight-fisted night!

00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,320
We have no interest in treasure chests

22
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,500
A pocket of romance, and

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,580
We are!

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,600
Let's pile up all the dreams,

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,360

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,880
I saw you taking off your pants!

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,850
Kidding! How embarrassing!

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,000
Having so much fun~! I'm alone, but I'm having so much fun~!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Hello~!

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,310
45 degrees!

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,600
Aha, look at this, someone! Ah, I am all alone...

38
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,200
Hey, Brook! How long are you gonna sleep, anyway?

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Wake up, we've spotted an island!

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,300
It's a summer island! A beach!

41
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,900
Ah... Huh... Um...

42
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,220
Huh? Huh? No, what is this?!

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,620
What's wrong, Brook?

44
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,530
If you're not here, we can't start, right?

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,640
Ah... You are all here!

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,840
Huh? I am so glad... Huh...?!

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,850
How can you be alive? Why?

48
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,180
What're you saying? How long are you gonna keep dreaming?

49
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,200
If it hurts, that must mean this isn't a dream!

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,630
This is real! That other part must have been the dream! Thank G-

51
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,110
I wonder if Captain Yorki managed to get through the Calm Belt safely.

52
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, I guess only the ocean knows that!

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,620
We have to carry on, for his sake!
Take this new ship onward, to where Laboon's waiting!

54
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,980
It is morning!

55
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,840
We're awake!

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,640
It's a huge storm! The sail's gonna be torn to pieces!

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,710
Hah! We just have to sing and ride it through!

58
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,580
Wow, Brook! Look at this!
You've got yourself a bounty!

59
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,580
Hmm? What's this?! Keep playing, Brook!

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,570
Yeah!! I was dancing with chopsticks in my nose!!

61
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,890
Please wait a minute.

62
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,300
Well...

63
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,480
Awesome~!

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,970
YOU CAN DO THAT?!

65
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,940
This is called a Tone Dial... I bought it from a merchant ship.

66
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,890
It's a very rare kind of shell that can record sound and play it back.

67
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,270
Oh, those things from Sky Island!

68
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,680
You are familiar with it?

69
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:42,050
When I meet Laboon again, I plan on letting him hear this. I always keep it on my body.

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,420
You've got something recorded on that?

71
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,590
It is a song.

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,740
It's the voice of my crewmates singing, back when they were still alive.

73
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,500
Something to let him know that we were all happy right to the end of our journey. A message to Laboon...

74
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,910
May I play it now?

75
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,670
Oh, I wanna hear it! I'm sure Laboon would love to hear it, too!

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,140
Well, then...

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,890
How... many of us... are still breathing...?

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,870
We're breathing... but it doesn't seem like there's any hope for any of us...

79
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,090
Looks like we've got ourselves wiped out...

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,460
Their weapons were... poisoned...

81
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,140
Seems like we're all gonna die, huh?

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,880
We're pirates, so we were prepared to die at any time, but...

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,980
we didn't think we'd all die at once...!

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,100
Laboon...

85
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,420
Brook... About that Revive Fruit of yours...

86
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,320
Who knows... I have never died before, but... I have an idea!

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,530
We will die anyway, so let us die while having fun...

88
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,670
Shall we sing a song?

89
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,140
If the power of the Revive Fruit really will bring me back to life...

90
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,520
then I will deliver it to him without fail!

91
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
The Tone Dial...

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,450
This song that Laboon, the captain, and all of us loved...

93
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,810
Waiting for us at that cape, not knowing whether we will come today or tomorrow...

94
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,860
Our comrade.... I will deliver it to Laboon!

95
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,050
Great idea!

96
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,380
Yeah... You guys... Let's not fall until the end!

97
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,400
Let him hear it...!

98
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,980
Let's give Laboon the Rumbar Pirates' once-in-a-lifetime performance!

99
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,690
Huh? If it's this song, then we'll all join in, too!

100
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:16,720
Binks' Sake

101
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,690
{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' sake

102
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,090
{\an8}Following the sea breeze, riding on the waves

103
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,360
{\an8}Far across the salty deeps, the merry evening sun

104
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,730
{\an8}Painting circles in the sky, birds singing along

105
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,930
{\an8}Farewell to the harbour, to my old hometown

106
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,280
{\an8}Let's all sing out with a DON, as the ship sets sail

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,540
{\an8}Waves of gold and silver dissolve to salty spray

108
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,920
{\an8}As we all set sail to the ends of the sea

109
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,680
{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' sake

110
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,930
{\an8}We are pirates, slicing through the seas

111
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,240
{\an8}The waves our pillows, the ship our roost

112
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,520
{\an8}Flying the proud skull on our flags and sails

113
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,580
{\an8}Now comes a storm through the far-off sky

114
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,000
{\an8}Now the waves are dancing, beat upon the drums

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,240
{\an8}If you lose your nerve, this breath could be your last

116
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,760
{\an8}But if you just hold on, the morning sun will rise

117
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,150
{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' sake

118
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,320
{\an8}Today, and tomorrow, our dreams through the night

119
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,670
{\an8}Waving our goodbyes, we'll never meet again

120
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,740
{\an8}But don't look so down; for at night the moon will rise

121
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,140
{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' sake

122
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,470
{\an8}Let's all sing out with a DON, a song of the waves

123
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,700
{\an8}Doesn't matter who you are, someday you'll just be bones

124
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,850
{\an8}Never-ending, ever-wandering, our funny traveling tale

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,750
What is wrong? Now, this is just a quartet...

126
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,550
Trio...

127
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,720
Duet...

128
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,250
Solo...

129
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,270
Why? Leaving just the accompaniment...

130
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,480
If you wanna join my crew, all I ask is that you love music!

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,640
This is the ship of the Rumbar Pirates, who can even make a crying child laugh!

132
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,170
Laboon! We will definitely return here!

133
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,030
Wait for us!

134
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,510
Laboon... You have waited there for fifty years...

135
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,570
But can you wait for just another year or two?

136
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,540
For I, too, have the true spirit of a pirate!

137
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,660
You are facing that wall and waiting for me... And just as we promised, when I meet you again...

138
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
I'll be coming over that wall!

139
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Hey, skeleton!

140
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,180
Is the song over already?

141
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,290
Give us another one! Just one more!

142
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,190
The song I once sung with my comrades, who were so full of life...

143
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,880
Was the final performance of the Rumbar Pirates.

144
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,650
During the fifty years when I was drifting alone in that dark, dark, sea of mist...

145
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,310
How many times did I listen to this...?

146
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,460
On that vast ship, all on my own,

147
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,620
this song was the only thing that made me feel that there was life besides my own.

148
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,750
However, today, I have finally found new conviction in my heart...

149
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,100
So I shall seal away this Tone Dial.

150
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,040
Seal!

151
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,320
WHAAAAT?! SO YOU REALLY CAN DO THAT?!

152
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,620
I now know that Laboon is still safe, and waiting for me...

153
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,470
And I have gotten my shadow back, and can escape from these cursed waters.

154
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,380
This Dial, with everyone's voices recorded upon it,

155
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,700
is no longer going to be used so I can think back on the past...

156
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,850
It is a song for Laboon.

157
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,340
Every day was painful...

158
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,090
I was truly unable to see any hope.

159
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,280
But, now, Luffy-san...

160
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,180
I am so glad to be alive!

161
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,820
I truly am glad to be alive!

162
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,360
Well, sure!

163
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,430
Finally, this day has come!

164
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,520
Right.

165
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,400
May I join your crew?

166
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,690
Sure, why not.

167
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,140
WHAT?! JUST LIKE THAT?!

168
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,980
HE JOINED?!

169
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,560
But, whatever! We've got our musician! Hooray!

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,240
A musician! He's just bones, but he's our musician!

171
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,660
The musician we've always wanted!

172
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,190
He's so light, too!

173
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,920
That lightness is another thing that's great about you!

174
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,030
It's great!

175
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,600
Yes! Because I am just bones~!

176
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,180
He's so funny!

177
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,640
Just bones! Just bones! Just bones! Just bones!

178
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,640
I get it!

179
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,350
They certainly are very lively.

180
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,000
Why do we keep gathering up people like that?

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
I don't really understand, but they seem happy, don't they, Namizou?

182
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,090
I guess. Thanks.

183
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,220
I don't get it at all, but cheers!

184
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,160
We have no idea, but cheers!

185
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
45 degrees!

186
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,960
Laboon...

187
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,760
I will not turn back.

188
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,370
We always pushed on, straight forward.

189
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,380
That path was the only one we could take in order to come back to you.

190
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,330
To travel around the world was our goal, and you were waiting at the finish line.

191
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,700
Right? So I will not turn back.
I will carry on, and see you again.

192
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,680
Please wait for me!

193
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,160
It will just be a little longer...

194
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,770
What is it, Laboon?

195
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,060
You're in a really good mood today, huh?

196
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,370
Allow me to introduce myself!

197
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,340
A wanted-poster? You had a bounty?

198
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,850
I have still not introduced myself properly... I am "Dead Bones", and my name is Brook!

199
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,120
I am a wanted man... My title is "Humming Brook"!

200
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,810
My current bounty is 33 million bellies!

201
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,390
Once the leader of an escort convoy,

202
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:39,270
and afterwards, musician and swordsman, and eventually acting Captain, of the Rumbar Pirates!

203
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,680
I offer my services and my life to captain Straw Hat Luffy!

204
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,910
I hope not to be a burden to you all!

205
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,280
I shall work myself to the bone!

206
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,420
Alright! Let's have one more toast!

207
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,230
Two days later

208
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,960
Magnificent! Thank you so much, Franky-san, Usopp-san!

209
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,860
No problem at all! This was easy!

210
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,000
My design was a great success!

211
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,780
I picked the flowers!

212
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,070
What a magnificent grave...

213
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,820
After all, I couldn't possibly expect you to bring all those bones with you on Lion-chan.

214
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,030
Call it the Thousand Sunny next time, OK?

215
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,070
So strange that this Thriller Bark should have come from our own homeland, West Blue...

216
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,520
But here, in the earth of our homeland, they might at last be able to rest in peace.

217
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,660
Then, Brook, we'll be going now.

218
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,580
We'll be going on ahead.

219
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,660
See you later.

220
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,440
Yes.

221
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,060
Ah, that surprised me. So, you have finally recovered?

222
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,940
Yeah. I just overslept a little.

223
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,000
Is that...

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,850
It's a dead sword... Yubashiri.
I was gonna give it a proper burial.

225
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,770
Luffy is the man who is gonna be the Pirate King!

226
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,780
Um...

227
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,500
Ah, no...

228
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,140
Ah, that is right, I became a part of your crew.

229
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,710
Huh, is that so? Well, you've got bad luck.

230
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,310
This is a pretty crazy crew, you know.

231
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,560
It seems that way. I will do my best until I die.

232
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,550
Ah, but I am already dead.

233
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,780
OK! Now that Zoro's awake, let's head out to sea!

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,700
Let's head off to our next adventure!

235
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,010
YEAH!!!

236
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,520
Zoro, you took off your bandages again?!

237
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,180
Yeah, 'cause they're hard to move around in.

238
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,580
I put them there so you wouldn't move around so much!

239
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,310
Wait!

240
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,440
He sure recovered quickly. Are you already setting sail?

241
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,310
You can take Brook's ship.

242
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,520
I fixed the helm and the sail.

243
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,740
Thanks.

244
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,880
After all you've done, we're really indebted to you.

245
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,420
We couldn't thank you enough no matter how hard we tried.

246
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,300
Will you marry me?

247
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
You seem like a nice lady, but I'm afraid I'm far too super for you.

248
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,960
It's a real shame to see you guys go!

249
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,200
Couldn't you stay and party for just a few more days?

250
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,680
No way! We're going to Fishman Island!

251
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm really excited!

252
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,390
I bet we'll meet some funny guys there!

253
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,740
And some beautiful mermaids! Ah, what I wouldn't love to do with one of them~!

254
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,770
I wonder if the mermaids will let me see their panties...

255
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,300
Hey, hey! Don't be ridiculous!

256
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,570
Mermaids don't wear panties!

257
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,380
While we're talking about how beautiful mermaids are...

258
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,800
I hear even the Pirate Empress Hancock was totally overwhelmed...

259
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,050
Mermaids~! Mermaids~!

260
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,810
Surely they have tails instead of legs anyway?

261
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,320
How do you guys know that, anyway?

262
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,980
Oh, well, about three years ago, before we came here, we went to Fishman Island! That place is the best!

263
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,860
Lola, you guys went to the New World?!

264
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,510
We didn't go there! We were born in the New World!

265
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,990
My mama was a pirate, too.

266
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,730
Ah, that's right...

267
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,820
This is my mama's Vivrecard. I'll let you have it.

268
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,660
Paper?

269
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,200
Wow! That's incredible!

270
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,630
Captain Lola's mama is a great pirate!

271
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,670
Take good care of it! It'll definitely be useful later!

272
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,090
What's a Vivrecard?

273
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,510
Huh? You don't know?

274
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,720
Captain Lola, they only make Vivrecards in the New World.

275
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
Ah, that's true...

276
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,620
This is no ordinary paper.

277
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,340
It's resistant to both fire and water.

278
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,380
What you do is you take a few of your own fingernails to a shop,

279
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,210
and they use them to make you a special sheet of paper.

280
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,730
That is the "Card of Life", the Vivrecard.

281
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,070
What you do, is you tear off pieces and give them to friends or family if they're going away.

282
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,180
Look at this.

283
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,220
This is the Vivrecard my mama gave me.

284
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,000
It moved!

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,660
No matter where in the world the Card pieces are, they share a connection.

286
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,450
So I can always tell in what direction my mama is!

287
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,200
Although you can't tell how far away.

288
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,540
Wow, so mysterious!

289
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,690
And they have lots of them in the New World, right?

290
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,180
It's quite convenient!

291
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,440
Here, I'll just sign this piece of my Mama's Vivrecard for you...

292
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,570
If you ever run into trouble, just follow this and go see Mama.

293
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,670
And be sure to tell her that I'm doing fine, too.

294
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,340
I think I've got one of those, too.

295
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,290
I just thought of that too.

296
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,160
Isn't this just like that white piece of paper Ace gave you back then?

297
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,240
This piece of paper will allow us to meet again.

298
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,460
So, that's what he meant...

299
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,060
Here it is...

300
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,940
But it's burning, and seems like it's gotten smaller...

301
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,400
Wait, you! Let me see that!

302
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,670
Yes, this is certainly a Vivrecard...

303
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,720
But I didn't tell you this yet... This paper also reflects the owner's vitality and life force!

304
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,350
This belonged to someone important to you, right?

305
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,050
Yeah! It's my brother's!

306
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,860
Lola?

307
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,260
I hate to tell you, but this person's life...

308
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,900
is fading!
