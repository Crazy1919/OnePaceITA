00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,460
Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,840
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,220
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,310
We were able to escape from the set course

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,860
along the boundary between sky and sea.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,110
Now we're rowing our way

Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,220
raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,970
ring out.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,030
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,820
Because of that

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,490
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,750
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,670
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,350
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,770
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,440
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,620
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,960
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,290
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,630
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,800
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,130
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,490
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,270
making a splash...

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:38,480
{\an5}Oars' Awakening and
Brook vs. Ryuma!

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,030
Let's get started!

39
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,930
W-What's this...?

40
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,260
A-A giant's corpse...?

41
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,310
Even for a giant it's too big!

42
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,030
Don't make a sound, Chopper.

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,990
Calm down, Straw Hat Luffy's Shadow.

44
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,450
I'm your new master.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,670
You'll receive a new voice and body to live as a zombie from now on.

46
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,840
Forget every connection with your previous human body.

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Submit to me and become my loyal soldier.

48
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,300
We have a deal then.

49
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,000
Cindry-chan, you also entered a contract to forget your past existence...

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,890
So we should be able to eat with plates.

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,950
It would be best if your knees were broken as well.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Scary!

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,690
Cindry-chan, that threat was way too scary!

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,410
Cindry is really strict with Hogback.

55
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,760
Now, awake...!

56
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,540
T-The shadow...!

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,380
From your 500 year slumber!

58
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,980
Luffy's shadow was...

59
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,600
It's in.

60
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,940
No! Don't yell!

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,910
The corpse moved!

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,830
What?

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,090
D-Damn it! We've been found!

64
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,730
We screamed!

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,920
The demon has awakened!

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,350
Hey, Kumashi!

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,510
Don't tell me you've been hiding those pirates!

68
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,120
My bride!

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,810
Why's she here?!

70
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,300
Splendid!

71
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,480
What violence!

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,810
It's a masterpiece!

73
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,960
Truly a devil!

74
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,210
Meat!

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm hungry!

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,750
Hey! Where did the pirates...? Where did my bride go?!

77
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,160
They ran at full speed!

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,690
They sure are fast!

79
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,730
You won't escape!

80
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,770
Sanji, food!

81
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,010
Who's this Sanji?

82
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,460
What happened...?

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,920
What happened just now?

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,470
It started moving as soon as Luffy's shadow was inserted!

85
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,850
So that's how zombies work!

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,650
That was what Dr. Hogback meant by "giving back life!"

87
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,650
That huge man's ability...

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,860
It's probably a devil fruit ability!

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,530
The fact his first word was "meat" means...

90
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,870
That giant monster without a doubt holds Luffy's personality.

91
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,610
Ah, right.

92
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,660
Then, if I remember correctly...

93
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,380
That Sanji-like penguin we met at the bridge...

94
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,630
Even if I die...

95
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,470
I won't hurt a lady!

96
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,610
I see!

97
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,010
Then, Sanji's shadow was embedded into it.

98
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,800
Most likely.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,230
So, the samurai who hit us with the back of the sword...

100
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,540
That's Brook!

101
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,350
Incredible!

102
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,190
So all those strange incidents were tied together.

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,880
These terrible zombies are just a game to him!

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,310
He's just toying with people's lives!

105
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,100
What "mankind dream"...!

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,830
What "bringing back the dead"...!

107
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,580
Dr. Hogback is a great man!

108
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,790
I highly respect him!

109
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,800
He doesn't want to help anyone in the least!

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,220
He's just another villain!

111
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,890
Chopper...

112
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,650
This isn't the time to be crying over that.

113
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,140
Our friends are becoming victims of this zombie game!

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,280
Do you understand?

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,840
We have to save them!

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,770
Hurry up!

117
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,260
We're going to where Luffy's being transported!

118
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,800
Yea, they said to "take them back to the ship"!

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
I wonder if they meant the Sunny?

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,560
If the same thing happened to Zoro and Sanji...

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,780
They must be there as well!

122
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,610
You're right!

123
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,230
Let's go help 'em!

124
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,420
Usopp!

125
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,360
Chopper!

126
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,220
Are you okay?!

127
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,530
What?

128
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,680
It hurts, what're you-?!

129
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,880
Let go of me!

130
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,760
This guy...!

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,790
What strength!

132
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,050
Are you done saying goodbye?

133
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,400
Today I'll marry this woman.

134
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,280
Idiot...

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,100
For the manly Usopp, there's no point in living...

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,600
If he can't protect even one woman!

137
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,580
Usopp, that weapon...!

138
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,460
Take this!

139
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,510
Six Chambered Viper Star!

140
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,370
He's disappearing again!

141
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,490
What? Even me?

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,910
Nami disappeared too!

143
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,580
Nami!

144
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
Where are you?!

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,170
What?

146
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,150
Her scent is being erased by another smell!

147
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,250
Help me!

148
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,960
Usopp, Cho-!

149
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,820
Hey! Nami, what's wrong?!

150
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,890
Where are you?!

151
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,940
Answer me, Nami!

152
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,010
Zombies!

153
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,210
I'll leave them to you.

154
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,770
Take those two to Moria-sama!

155
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,730
Huh?

156
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,340
Where's he talking from?!

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,160
What?! An armored zombie?!

158
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,960
More zombies are coming from below!

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,040
Zombies are coming from above too!

160
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,500
Hey, pirates...!

161
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,710
Hand over your shadows!

162
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,030
Don't get caught, they'll steal our shadows!

163
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,340
Y-Yea.

164
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,010
There's also portrait zombies!

165
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,380
Damn!

166
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,910
It's unfair to make an undead dog-pile!

167
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,440
Unfair!

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,980
We're just gonna take your shadow, bro.

169
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,130
Damn, let me go!

170
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,950
Damn!

171
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,040
Hey, someone's there!

172
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,620
They're purifying the others!

173
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,920
Get your dirty hands off...

174
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,780
My little brothers!

175
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,550
Who're these guys?!

176
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,000
They're extremely dangerous!

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,100
B...!

178
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,860
Big Bro!

179
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,560
Robin!

180
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,820
Didn't we make it on time?

181
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,230
There's one missing.

182
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,910
Usopp.

183
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,220
Chopper.

184
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
Are you hurt?

185
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,960
Impossible!

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,440
Aside from the Humming One, other bastards who know our weak point have appeared!

187
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
This is terrible!

188
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,860
"We can't die" was our catchphrase, I don't wanna spend my days in fear of annihilation!

189
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,110
I heard that those whose shadows were taken are carried past these long stairs.

190
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,080
That's right, Luffy was transported through here!

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,470
We were going after him, but then Nami...!

192
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,470
I wonder if Nami's okay...

193
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,360
It wasn't like he wanted to exterminate her. We'll definitely be back to rescue her!

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
By the way...

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,530
That monster-like growl coming from upstairs...

196
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,010
What was it?

197
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,010
Yeah, we went there after we heard it.

198
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,030
That was Luffy's voice...

199
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,500
We'll tell you everything we witnessed.

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,210
Anyway... something terrible has happened!

201
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,720
Keep delivering more!

202
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,060
He hasn't had enough yet!

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,570
How much can the Special Zombie eat?!

204
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,780
He's gonna eat the whole island's provisions!

205
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,850
What an amazing appetite.

206
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,970
Kumashi, why were you hiding those pirates?!

207
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,850
But... that's...

208
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,520
Stop talking, it's un-cute!

209
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,130
Sorry, tiny leek.

210
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,150
I don't know you and yet you're feeding me.

211
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,510
Even though it tastes terrible and isn't enough.

212
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
Damn you Special Zombie!

213
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,860
Don't act so cheeky!

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,890
Who do you think makes us, zombies, move?!

215
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,300
How can you even complain to the ruler of Thriller Bark?!

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,080
The Master will someday become ruler of this sea-

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
We're really sorry!

218
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,940
This guy said all that!

219
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,180
You, don't sell out your friends!

220
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,900
Listen, Oars.

221
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,650
500 years ago you were a huge villain who left numerous legends behind.

222
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,560
And now you've been resurrected to become my servant in this present day.

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,870
Servant?

224
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,180
I don't want that.

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,910
I have a dream.

226
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,970
I've never seen such an insolent zombie!

227
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,660
It's cramped and boring here.

228
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,690
I'm gonna go outside for a bit.

229
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,830
Maybe go out to sea and go around the world.

230
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,240
Going on a trip?!

231
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,010
You blockhead, that's impossible.

232
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,860
This special freezer is made from super dense steel and it's completely sealed.

233
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,940
You won't be able to scratch it in the leas-

234
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Rubber...

235
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,240
Pistol!

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,480
H-Hey! Wait!

237
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,650
This is terrible, Oars has escaped!

238
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,090
Strange...

239
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,030
I had a feeling that my arm would stretch but... well, whatever.

240
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,210
I'm gonna be... the Pirate King!

241
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,970
Just like then...

242
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,900
Pleading "not the afro", "not the afro"... You'll wind up shamelessly begging me for your life again.

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
No!

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,920
It won't go that way!

245
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,200
It's pointless.

246
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,650
Even if I muster my courage and cut them, those scary zombies keep getting up!

247
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,860
They definitely must have a weakness.

248
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,880
At this rate, even if I find my own zombie, there wouldn't be anything I could do.

249
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
More than anything, zombies' faces are just too scary!

250
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,490
One of ours was purified!

251
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,750
What happened?!

252
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,210
He was hungry and ate some salty grilled fish.

253
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,570
Idiot, he was a newcomer.

254
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,220
This must be the zombies' weakness!

255
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,270
You! You're the skeleton whose shadow we stole a few days ago.

256
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,710
How did you get back here?

257
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,330
Answer my question!

258
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,820
Which zombie has my shadow?

259
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,940
If you don't answer, I'll scatter fish all over the island!

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,100
Fish...?

261
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,360
And how's that gonna affect me?

262
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
That's...

263
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,440
No way...

264
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,160
But, I don't think it could be salt...

265
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,950
Salt...?

266
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,310
A-And h-how is salt g-gonna do any good?!

267
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,400
It's salt!

268
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,690
Zombies are really, really scary after all.

269
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,730
It's even worse during the night.

270
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,160
What, it was just a grasshopper.

271
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,560
It scared me.

272
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,610
Nonetheless, it's even more dangerous when the sun is shining, and it's easy to be found by the enemy.

273
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,480
That's it!

274
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,840
Sing!

275
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,430
When you're scared you should sing a song to take your mind off things!

276
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll be able to purify them if I don't look at their faces by using my skeleton speed.

277
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,240
Then, I'll definitely find my shadow!

278
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,910
What's this song?

279
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,520
Someone's humming.

280
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,190
Who is it?!

281
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,930
What's wrong?!

282
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,390
What's all the ruckus on the island about?!

283
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,250
There's a warrior with a scary face who appears when you hear humming in the darkness!

284
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,070
He's going around trying to find his shadow!

285
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,080
He already annihilated most of the Soldier Zombies!

286
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,370
Please do something!

287
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,940
Perona-sama, there's trouble...

288
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,000
Shut up!

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,740
Don't wake me, Kumashi...

290
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,780
Please wake up...

291
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,360
We finally meet.

292
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,910
What's with this strength?

293
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,600
Isn't this my zombie...?

294
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,180
I can't keep up with him at all!

295
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,000
Even though we share the same sword style!

296
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,250
Give up.

297
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,200
Regardless of how many times you try, it'll be the same.

298
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,330
If you try to move quicker, I'll cut off that ridiculous afro of yours.

299
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,890
P-Please don't!

300
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,690
Please don't touch the afro!

301
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,920
Please!

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
Why don't you know?!

303
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,330
If you're my shadow, then why don't you know how important this afro is?

304
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,730
Since my body no longer ages, it'll never grow again!

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,870
Why, you ask?

306
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,390
I've forgotten everything about my days with you.

307
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,730
Right now, I only obey Moriah-sama and Absalom-sama!

308
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,380
A skeleton who treasures his afro is nothing but a joke to me!

309
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,010
Stop!

310
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,070
Not the afro!

311
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,860
Not the afro!

312
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,210
Not the afro!

313
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,010
Not the afro!

314
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,670
What a miserable look, my former master.

315
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,640
I'm sorry... I've lost...

316
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,310
Please let me off...

317
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,830
I'll leave this island immediately.

318
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,600
Then, get out of my sight.

319
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,180
It'll be troublesome for me if you die.

320
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,860
It was a pathetic sight.

321
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,490
Say anything you want.

322
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,810
These past five years...

323
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,850
Just for this moment...!

324
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,890
I became stronger!

325
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,860
Absalom-sama.

326
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,230
Is everything ready for the ceremony?

327
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,150
Anytime you want.

328
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,940
What a beautiful bride!

329
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,740
We'll start the ceremony immediately.

330
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,580
Put her in a dress and bring her to the ceremonial hall.

331
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes, right away.

332
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,650
A monster bigger than giants?!

333
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,770
Yes...

334
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,220
That incredible noise and roar were his doing.

335
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,850
I can only imagine that's Luffy's zombie roaring and rampaging.

336
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,720
Let's hurry!

337
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey, look!

338
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,010
There's the Sunny!

339
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,270
I see...

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,570
If you head straight up you'll find the boss's room.

341
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,280
Are those stairs used for unloading?

342
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,490
Hey!

343
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,770
The whole place has been messed up!

344
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
No doubt it's the zombies' doing.

345
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,460
It's full of muddy footprints.

346
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Then, they might still be there...

347
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,540
A complete mess indeed.

348
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,260
There's barely anything left.

349
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,220
Is there any zombie around...?

350
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,010
First of all, where could they be...?

351
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,720
I don't see them.

352
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,330
Hey!

353
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,660
Luffy!

354
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,830
Zoro!

355
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,850
Sanji!

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,060
Hey, they're in the dining room!

357
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,500
The three of them!

358
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,070
The zombies completely re-decorated them.

359
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,800
Pitiful.

360
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,570
Wake up!

361
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,050
This isn't time the for a nap!

362
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,950
We have serious problems!

363
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,440
They're still asleep.

364
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,660
Did they feel anything at all?

365
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,150
It can't be helped.

366
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,250
Hey, step back, I'm gonna use the bazooka.

367
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,130
No, it's fine.
