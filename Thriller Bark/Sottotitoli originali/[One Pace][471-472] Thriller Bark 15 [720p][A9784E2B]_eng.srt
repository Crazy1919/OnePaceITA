raising our battle cry.

If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,610
ring out.

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,320

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,530
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,040
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,810
Because of that

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,480
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,750
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,690
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,060

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,770

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,620
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,290
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,630
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,800
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,130
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,490
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,280

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,770
Which means the ones remaining are...

41
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,740
That straw hat from before...

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,980
An orange woman...

43
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,450
And a cool hero.

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm missing three people.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,600
Where could they be?

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,860
She's awake.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,050
Stop!

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,940
Perona-sama.

49
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,090
I hate cockroaches! Get them off!

50
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,950
Perona-sama.

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,630
Please calm down!

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,850
Not cockroaches!

53
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,850
There's no such thing!

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,280
Where am I?

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,300
The enemy is no longer here.

56
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,070
You were unconscious.

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,630
What happened?

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,550
And to you of all people.

59
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,020
What happened to the mansion?!

60
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,340
Was this the pirates' doing?!

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,220
The pirates caused a lot of trouble, but...

62
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,110
These are the traces of Oars' mindless rampage.

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,020
Oars?

64
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,850
And, according to our reports, Oars annihilated all the Zombie Generals.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
The ultimate army?!

66
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,430
Is Oars out of control?!

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,220
Well, that's-

68
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,900
Guys!

69
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,840
Brothers!

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,290
Woman!

71
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,750
O-Oars?

72
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,570
B-By the way, it seems Hogback-sama got trampled...

73
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,490
What?!

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,100
No woman here?

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,760
Woman!

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,290
Woman?

77
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,630
This is bad, I have to get out of here!

78
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,500
Thriller Bark is being destroyed by Oars and the pirates!

79
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,130
Quickly! Gather the provisions and treasures!

80
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,800
Once you've put them on their pirate ship, we're outta here!

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,580
Their?

82
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,360
The Straw Hats'!

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,900
We will escape on their ship!

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,560
Quickly!

85
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,620
Yes, immediately!

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,850
Meanwhile, in an empty room.

87
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,720
Now, the vow kiss.

88
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,630
What?!

89
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,230
W-W-W-Wait!

90
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,030
What's this?!

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,330
No! Stop!

92
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,050
You're awake?

93
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,250
Give up, then!

94
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,700
Once I kiss you, you will become my wife.

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,540
I said no! You invisible, perverted beast!

96
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,300
I still wanna go on adventures!

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,270
Be quiet and accept it!

98
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,350
You will become the Graveyard King's wife! The Graveyard Queen!

99
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,840
No! What is that?!

100
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,440
Curse you, Namizou!

101
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,980
Lo-

102
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,100
Lola!

103
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,450
Namizou...

104
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,370
You!

105
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,910
How could you betray me?

106
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,210
That speech back then about supporting me was nothing but a lie!

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,290
What support?! You were trying to steal Ab-sama from me!

108
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,150
What kind of friend are you?!

109
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,340
W-Wait a minute, Lola!

110
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,350
I was unconscious all this time.

111
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,920
I don't know what's-

112
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,440
A wedding dress?

113
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,500
Why am I wearing this?

114
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,280
It's beautiful.

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,550
It's not beautiful, you traitor!

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,900
Wait! This is a misunderstanding!

117
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,790
Dammit, Lola!

118
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,640
Not only did you interrupt my wedding, but you are trying to harm my bride!

119
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,060
Shut up and marry me!

120
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,930
Hell no!

121
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,160
Ab-sama, you have no idea, do you?

122
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,660
This woman's real name is Namizou!

123
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,840
And she is actually a man!

124
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,390
What?!

125
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,800
That's impossible!

126
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,630
I did say that...

127
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,470
But, at the bathroom I certainly...

128
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,820
Disappear, Namizou!

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,440
Stop, Lola!

130
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,360
Hey, stop already, Lola!

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
Is she missing...?!

132
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,300
Namizou.

133
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,930
Lola.

134
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,660
Escape, Namizou.

135
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,470
I'll keep him busy.

136
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,710
I'm here to save you, my friend!

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
Lola!

138
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,230
Ab-sama!

139
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,540
Now that you know the truth, Absalom, forget about her and marry me instead!

140
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,030
Lola...

141
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,640
My bride is escaping!

142
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,150
I am your bride!

143
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,960
There's no doubt she's a woman, Lola.

144
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,290
Get out of my way!

145
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,610
Lola!

146
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,540
Meddling zombie...

147
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,140
You made me waste my strength.

148
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,220
Very smart...

149
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,750
You stopped running.

150
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,070
Either way...

151
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,570
You can't get away from me.

152
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,450
I'm an invisible man.

153
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,050
Thunder Charge!

154
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,770
How dare you!

155
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm here to save you, my friend!

156
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,340
How dare you hurt Lola!

157
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,120
That's it! Come straight into my arms!

158
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,820
Swing Arm!

159
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,600
It won't hurt you anyway!

160
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,620
I'm aware of that!

161
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,470
How come?

162
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,050
Back on the bridge, he didn't feel it.

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,610
Figures... He already exerted himself when he fought that man.

164
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,120
That must be it.

165
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,040
Well, it doesn't matter.

166
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,320
I won!

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I must have hit a weak spot!

168
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,960
Lola!

169
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,220
Are you alright?

170
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,190
Hang in there!

171
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,110
Thank you for coming to save me!

172
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,940
Why are you thanking me, Namizou?

173
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,360
We're friends.

174
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,780
But... Back then, I was scared of you, so I lied...

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,290
I'm actually a woman.

177
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,890
Silly you.

178
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,890
I knew.

179
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,750
Lola.

180
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,970
More importantly! Ab-sama is off-guard right now!

181
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,200
You shall be my husband now, Absalom!

182
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,890
Are you here?!

183
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,020
Come out, Straw Hat!

184
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,670
Woman!

185
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,590
Cool hero!

186
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,300
What was his name?

187
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,740
Let's see...

188
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
I'm sure it was Ross.

189
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,570
No, you got it wrong.

190
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,090
It ended with... "rs".

191
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,950
Fuse.

192
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,660
Whoa, that's a wild guess.

193
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,700
Uars?

194
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,400
Something's still missing...

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,390
Oars.

196
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,740
That's it!

197
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,190
Excuse me... I'm sorry, but my body...

198
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,510
Yeah, don't worry.

199
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,160
Can you still move?

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,950
Yes.

201
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,330
Then step aside.

202
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,020
Hey, Oars!

203
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,340
If you have Luffy's shadow inside of you...

204
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,630
Then you should already know that you should never...

205
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,360
underestimate your crewmates' strength.

206
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,510
You're a sturdy bunch, little pirates.

207
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,450
I have a proposal for you all...

208
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,340
How about we flip this guy over?

209
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,840
I see.

210
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,790
That would certainly be nice.

211
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,160
W-Wait a minute!

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
F-Flip over?!

213
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,910
This huge thing?!

214
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,590
However, with this enormous size, Luffy's attacks are more impressive.

215
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,830
But he doesn't look like a "Pirate King" in the least.

216
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,540
How shall we strike?

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,300
There are countless ways to do it.

218
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,040
He must have a weakness.

219
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,110
When you're catching a big fish, the most common tactic is to weaken it bit by bit.

220
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,290
If that's the plan, then I am...

221
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,450
Too scared.

222
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,450
I'll squash you!

223
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,300
Here he comes!

224
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,520
Rubber...

225
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,100
Butt Slam!

226
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,390
What kind of attack is that!?

227
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,220
Scatter!

228
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,800
Scythe!

229
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,160
Bastard.

230
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,410
In that case, I will show you...

231
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,260
Our combined power!

232
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,210
You two!

233
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,500
Let's do it!

234
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,270
Tactics Fifteen!

235
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,270
What?!

236
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,220
No way...

237
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,160
Are we gonna use "that" here?!

238
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,200
Zoro!

239
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Curly!

240
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,660
Stand by!

241
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,650
Just hold my legs!

242
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,530
What is he up to?

243
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,060
Here we go!

244
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,660
Pirates Docking 6...

245
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,400
Giant Robot Warrior...

246
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,840
Big Emperor!

247
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,090
Wait a minute, Franky!

248
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,230
The left arm hasn't docked yet!

249
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,400
What?!

250
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,500
Hey, what're you waiting for, Nico Robin?!

251
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,860
Hurry up and dock onto my left arm!

252
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,340
Robin, hurry!

253
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,420
Come, Robin!

254
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,670
Do it like me!

255
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,090
For a person, that's shameful.

256
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,480
Why did you stop?

257
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,640
Why're you shocked as well?!

258
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,290
I was starting to get excited.

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Do it!

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,680
The docking!

261
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,770
How absurd! I can't believe they made me do such a thing.

262
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,930
No, forget it happened.

263
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,930
Robin, if you had joined, we would've completed the Robot Warrior, Big Emperor!

264
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,530
I never thought you'd betray us! Never!

265
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,250
Luffy would have done it!

266
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,200
Don't ever ask me again...

267
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,420
to do your docking.

268
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,660
Payback time, you bastard!

269
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,020
Franky!

270
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,530
I'm gonna borrow this huge thing!

271
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,370
You! That's my Heavy Nunchaku!

272
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,800
It can't be helped,

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll lend it to you!

274
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,310
You bastard.

275
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,110
I have to hurry and go re-rescue Nami-san!

276
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,060
You?

277
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,950
Robin!

278
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,310
Once I reach his left arm, you take care of the joint!

279
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,860
Understood.

280
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,510
Perona-sama!

281
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,090
The fridge is already full!

282
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,880
Nothing else will fit.

283
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,050
There's still the pantry, isn't there?

284
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,840
Roger.

285
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,270
Hurry with the treasure!

286
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,580
Load the rest of it!

287
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,640
Roger!

288
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,190
Take this!

289
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,620
Deadly Special Oil Star!

290
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,600
Tri

291
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,600
ple

292
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,600
Shot!

293
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,870
Hey, curly eyebrow!

294
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,660
Throw me!

295
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,700
Carrying such huge thing...?

296
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,510
It's okay if you can't handle it!

297
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,930
Bastard!

298
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,310
Of course I can, idiot!

299
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,980
Armée de l'Air...

300
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,980
{\an8}Air Army

301
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,820
Power Shoot!

302
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,700
Great Sword Strike!

303
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,560
Cien Fleur...

304
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,560
{\an8}One Hundred Flowers

305
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,070
Big Tree!

306
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,100
W-What?

307
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,730
D-Dangerous... I'm falling! I'm falling!

308
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,380
Behold!

309
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,020
My super instant-made mid-air stairs!

310
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,820
Franky Skywalk!

311
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,960
But... this foothold won't last much longer!

312
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,140
Let's go already, Chopper!

313
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,070
Ok!

314
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,190
Super...

315
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,660
Frapper...

316
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,570
Gong!

317
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,120
Regardless of size, the human body always has the same weak spots.

318
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,590
Hitting your jaw will shake your brain a bit.

319
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,430
Now your only support is that single leg...

320
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,550
Monster Luffy.

321
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,320
Anti-Manner...

322
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,840
Kick...

323
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,450
Course!

324
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,650
Completely flipped that monster over.

325
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,550
Alright! Go down!

326
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,260
One down.

327
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,340
Hey, hey! This doesn't look like a mansion anymore.

328
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,960
What are those moves?!

329
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,040
Acrobatics?!

330
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,980
C-Could it be that...

331
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,440
Someone flipped him over?

332
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,780
C'mon, use your head.

333
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,470
Not even an army of one thousand men would be capable of such a thing.

334
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,290
I'll be fine, Namizou.

335
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,620
You go ahead and escape.

336
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,370
Let me explain the current situation.

337
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,830
Lola...

338
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,880
That friend of yours, Strawhat Luffy...

339
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,090
The Special Zombie who holds his shadow is rampaging all over the island.

340
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,370
It's the zombie we saw at that freezer room.

341
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,750
How troublesome!

342
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,360
How are we gonna take Luffy's shadow back from that monster?!

343
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,640
But...

344
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,060
There's no way I'm going back empty-handed after going through this nightmare!

345
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,520
There it is!

346
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,560
And it's not locked!

347
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,810
Why, you bastards...

348
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,180
I've had enough of you!

349
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,420
I will crush you all!

350
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,070
I just followed Moriah-sama for fun anyway.

351
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,900
Of course I'm not gonna stick around if my life is on the line.

352
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,850
Now, hurry up, all of you!

353
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,240
We need to get outta here as soon as possible!

354
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,980
Yes.

355
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,180
Alright! Load the remaining provisions!

356
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,770
Who are you?

357
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,220
You're not a zombie, are you?

358
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,820
What're you doing here?

359
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,540
Such a huge body...

360
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,430
You look just like a bear.

361
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,760
A Bear huh?

362
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,170
Now that's the right answer.

363
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,230
Is Moriah...

364
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,640
around here?
