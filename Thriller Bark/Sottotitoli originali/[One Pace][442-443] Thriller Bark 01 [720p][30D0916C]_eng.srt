raising our battle cry.

If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,340

That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,050
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,720
Because of that

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,770
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,840
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,600
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,910
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,310
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,650
you will move on.

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,720
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,090
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,490
Give them all out at a big party

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,230

This is paradise, paradise.

Taking a nice bath while being rocked by the waves...

43
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,100
This is the best.

44

Got it!

47
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,660
We caught a cool shark!

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,160
Put it in! Put it in!

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,000
Put it in the fish tank!

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Put it in!

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
Get in there!

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,480
Another one came in.

53
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,280
A shark.

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,380
Well, isn't this room perfect?

55
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,050
The room is fine, but a shark?! Those idiots.

56
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,010
Alright, let's go see it!

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,590
Let's see the tank!

58
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,500
Hey! Did the shark get in?

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,390
It's the one with the big horns!

60
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,970
Yes, it did, but...

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,240
All the fish you caught so far are gone.

62
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,400
That was obviously going to happen when you think about the consequences!

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,590
The ship continues its
favorable voyage.

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,910
{\an8}Damn it!

65
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,010
{\an8}Turn this bastard into dinner!

66
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,080
{\an8}Sanji! Make BBQ out of this stupid shark!

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
{\an8}Wait up, you novice!

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,050
This is a fresh fish.

69
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,660
Maybe some sushi... boiling it adding some spicy vinegar miso...

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,120
Tempura could also be good.

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,100
I'm getting hungry!

72
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,290
That was a nice bath.

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,600
Hey! Something's floating in the sea.

74
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,620
What is it?

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,770
A barrel?

76
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,760
It has "treasure" written on it.

77
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,120
Tribute to the Sea-God

78
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,320
You're right!

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,010
Could it be...

80
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,110
Some lost stuff from a treasure ship?!

81
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,420
Treasure?!

82
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,130
Treasure, treasure, we've discovered a treasure!

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,670
It's a shame.

84
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,190
It seems to be liquor and food supplies.

85
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,690
How can you tell without looking inside?!

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,190
It has " Tribute to the Sea-God" written on it, doesn't it?

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
That's a floating barrel someone sends when they pray to have a safe trip.

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,100
These offerings are sent to receive the sea's divine blessing.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,680
In short, the word "tribute" means "to God".

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,380
What, so it was pointless picking it up?

91
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,090
After all it's booze, isn't it?

92
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,810
Let's drink it.

93
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,050
Idiot! You'll get punished!

94
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,520
You'll be fine as long as you pray, won't you?

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,820
I won't pray to some God.

96
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,860
It's said that liquor which is cared for by the sea waves has an exceptional taste.

97
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,460
That's something we must taste!

98
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,160
Alright! Let's have a toast!

99
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,670
After drinking it, we're supposed to refill the barrel with new offerings and set it adrift again.

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Open it!

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,810
Hurry!

102
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,280
Hey, God! We'll be receiving this!

103
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,850
What God?!

104
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,250
Who was the one that beat the hell out of this "God" at the Sky Island...

105
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,160
Alright! It's open!

106
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,500
Something flew out!

107
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,260
What is that?!

108
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,230
A red light...?!

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,740
What?

110
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,830
What does this mean?

111
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,870
The liquor flew out, sparkled and then disappeared.

112
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
It was a flare.

113
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,770
A flare?

114
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,640
Could it be a curse from the Sea-God?

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,190
It might have been just a prank, but...

116
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,710
Probably...

117
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,780
Someone might be tracking this ship from now on.

118
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,820
N-No way...!

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,150
Some sort of trap?!

120
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,100
By opening the barrel, we've informed someone that we're here?! {maybe it could be reworded, like "We've informed someone that we're here by opening the barrel?!"}

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,790
We really can't see anyone one, but...

122
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,490
This atmospheric pressure...

123
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,130
The cloud currents are moving really fast.

124
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,770
I can't see anyone!

125
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,740
Nothing here either!

126
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,200
Everyone, to your posts!

127
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,980
Head south-southeast!

128
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,410
A great storm is approaching within five minutes!

129
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,770
I can't see it but,

130
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,140
If she says so, it must be very close! {shouldn't it be "I can't see it," as 1st line and "but if she says so, it must be very close!" as 2nd line?}

131
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,720
Nami, which way?!

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,420
2 o'clock ahead!

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,110
It's no use!

134
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,710
We're facing a head wind!

135
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,120
We're being pushed back!

136
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,290
Hey!

137
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,570
Do you really think this is all this boat can handle?

138
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,260
That's right!

139
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,420
Everyone raise the sails!

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,960
We're bringing out the paddle!

141
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,310
That?!

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,580
I really like that! It's so cool!

143
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,700
Soldier Dock System!

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,000
Channel Zero!

145
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,040
Cola Engine!

146
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,230
Paddle Ship Sunny!

147
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,400
Go!

148
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,970
Come on!

149
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,640
We made it through...

150
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,850
We made it through, but...

151
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,850
What's with this sea?

152
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,580
It's not even night, and yet...

153
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,050
This eerie fog has made everything dark.

154
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,350
Perhaps...

155
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,660
We've ventured into that sea area...

156
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,590
We're not prepared yet!

157
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
We've already arrived at the Fishman Island?

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,170
No, first we need to get through the sea where ghosts come out.

159
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,170
That's right.

160
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,840
Don't let your guard down.

161
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,560
Without a doubt... this area is already... the famous... {already?}

162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,180
Florian Triangle.

163
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,750
The outrageous sea where everything mysteriously disappears!

164
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,720
Eh?! G-Gho... G-Gho...

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,820
Ghosts come out, right in this sea.

166
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,460
Stop joking!

167
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,130
How come everyone besides me knows about that story?!

168
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,390
We heard it from Old Lady Kokoro.

169
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,290
There are living skeletons here.

170
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,540
L-Living skeletons?!

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,970
That's just your imagination.

172
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,980
Don't scare him over such absurd stuff.

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Listen, Usopp.

174
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,910
Every year, more than 100 ships mysteriously vanish within this very sea.

175
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,280
Moreover, it is said that a ghost ship with the souls of deceased people wanders this sea.

176
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,170
I don't want that!

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,970
You should've said that earlier!

178
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,620
And what if I had?

179
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,390
I would be prepared!

180
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,630
Prepared some items to disperse the evil spirits!

181
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,310
Usopp, lend me some of them too!

182
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,300
What's this voice?!

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,680
It appeared!

184
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,830
The ghost ship!

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,340
What's with this song?

186
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,460
It's the song of evil spirits!

187
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,160
Don't listen to it!

188
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,610
Close your ears or you'll be cursed!

189
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,120
No matter what kind of thing the ghost says to you, don't listen to him!

190
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,320
If you answer back, he'll drag you to sea with him!

191
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Evil spirits are always hunting travelers!

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,730
Who could be... riding this ship...?

193
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,040
If he's an enemy, I'll just chop his head off.

194
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,560
Something... is there.

195
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,070
Going to deliver...

196
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,250
Binks' Sake...

197
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,010
Why do I have to go?

198
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,200
I wanna go back.

199
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,260
That's why I told you I'd go by myself.

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
No way!

201
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,880
What if our ship gets cursed because of your stupidity?

202
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,190
I had terrible luck!

203
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,860
Nami-san, it's alright!

204
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,120
I'll protect you, Nami-san!

205
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,050
Nami, you wanted to find the treasure ship, didn't you?

206
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,110
There's no way this is a treasure ship!

207
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,280
You saw it, didn't you?!

208
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,730
That moving skeleton!

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
He must be the treasure's guardian.

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,750
Anyway, let's look for him!

211
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,510
Evil spirits, begone! Evil spirits, begone!

212
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,290
Luffy, rest in peace...!

213
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,050
{\an8}Nice to meet you! Yohohoho!

214
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,220
Skeleton Gentleman
Brook

215
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,140
{\an8}Forgive my discourtesy, I couldn't greet you when we first met.

216
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,870
{\an8}You surprised me!

217
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,660
{\an8}It's been many decades since the last time I met a person.

218
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,660
{\an8}Ship after ship, it's the same, just ghost ships wandering around here.

219
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,570
{\an8}It's kind of scary!

220
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,620
{\an8}Well, make yourselves at home and come inside.

221
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,050
{\an8}We'll be able to talk more relaxed.

222
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,150
Look, it's talking!

223
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,710
The afro-skeleton is talking!

224
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,060
Unbelievable!

225
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,900
My, my!

226
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,170
What a lovely young lady!

227
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,300
Beautiful indeed!

228
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,110
Eh... no... not at all...

229
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,380
I have a good eye for beautiful ladies!

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,360
Although, skeletons don't have eyes!

231
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,500
Can you please show me your panties?

232
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
As if!

233
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,170
My, my, quite a harsh one!

234
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,480
The flesh came right off of my bones...

235
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,050
Although I'm only a skeleton.

236
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,150
Shut up!

237
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,590
Hey, can you poop?

238
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,010
There are plenty of other questions to ask besides that!

239
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,750
Yes, I can.

240
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,980
There's no need to answer!

241
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
Nevermind that!

242
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,550
Firstly! Although you're nothing but bones, how can you be alive and talk?!

243
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,920
What exactly are you?

244
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,630
Why are you here?

245
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,790
What's happening on this ship?!

246
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,500
And what's happening on this sea?!

247
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,540
Answer all of this now!

248
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,080
Nevermind all that.

249
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,860
Hey you!

250
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,700
Join my crew!

251
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,590
Sure, why not.

252
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,590
How do you do?

253
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,430
I'm afraid that while traveling, my ship ran into quite a bit of trouble!

254
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,900
I am "Just Dead Bones" Brook!

255
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,050
It's a pleasure to meet you!

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,380
What the hell?!

257
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,520
Who is this guy?!

258
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,390
Oh my, oh my!

259
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,500
How harsh!

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,470
It's a skeleton!

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,970
Oh, what a beautiful woman!

262
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,320
Would you allow me to see your panties?

263
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
Stop it, you perverted skeleton!

264
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,160
Damn it! Skeletons can't talk, or walk, or have afros!

265
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,190
This is a dream!

266
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,590
It's gotta be a dream!

267
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,130
Really?!

268
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,660
What a relief... just a dream...

269
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,770
Hey, Luffy!

270
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,110
What's with this guy?

271
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,310
Isn't he funny?

272
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,580
He's part of our crew now.

273
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,400
I don't care, I won't let him be!

274
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,380
Why the hell did you guys go with him?

275
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,350
Wasn't it to stop him from doing something like this?!

276
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,620
Sorry...

277
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,160
It's nothing to get so worked up about.

278
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,490
Let's go inside now.

279
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,830
We can have dinner!

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,800
Who are you to decide that?!

281
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,010
Oh, what a wonderful dining room!

282
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,610
And the kitchen!

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
This is such a marvelous ship!

284
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,460
Yeah, that's 'cuz this super guy made it!

285
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,970
You've really got an eye for quality.

286
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,680
Hey, don't get attached to him, Franky.

287
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,240
But what I'm truly looking forward to is the food.

288
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,030
I haven't had any good food for so many years...

289
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:46,040
I've lived so long with these hunger pains that I feared I was just skin and bones...

290
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,280
Although I'm a skeleton and don't have any skin at all!

291
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,700
Skull joke!

292
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:03,170
As a gentleman, I enjoy the time spent awaiting my meal...

293
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,540
Dinner, yeah!

294
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,540
Food! Food!

295
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,610
Chef, please bring me some milk to drink!

296
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,450
Just shut up and wait!

297
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,350
So anyway, Korobokle...

298
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh no, it's Brook.

299
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,920
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't yet have your name...?

300
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,050
Me?

301
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,450
I'm Luffy.

302
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,220
So, anyway, what are you?

303
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,200
You two didn't even ask that kind of thing?!

304
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,870
We can get rid of the skeleton later.

305
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,190
Right now, it's time to eat!

306
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,660
An entire octopus meal.

307
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,440
It looks good!

308
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,030
Hey, Brook, make sure you eat a lot!

309
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,280
Sanji's food is the best!

310
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,070
Oh, but...

311
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,570
I'm afraid that my heart is even emptier than my stomach...

312
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,290
My fair lady, your portion seems to be a little large.

313
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,610
Would you care to trade?

314
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,060
There's a lot more left, so just eat your own!

315
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,470
The Revival Fruit?

316
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,700
So you ate a devil fruit....

317
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,330
That's correct.

318
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,860
To tell you the truth, I died once years ago.

319
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,590
First, clean your face off.

320
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,100
How'd you get yourself so dirty?

321
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,430
The Revival Fruit...

322
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,740
Grants the ability to resurrect, so as a "resurrection human"…

323
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,840
You have the promise of a second life.

324
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,720
It's quite a mysterious ability.

325
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,250
Yes, at that time, I was a pirate just like you.

326
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,980
Excuse me.

327
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,550
Excuse me.

328
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,890
I just wanna beat some manners into you...

329
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,960
Long ago...

330
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,080
On the ship I was on before,

331
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,250
The crew I was a part of came to this sea of devils.

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,540
However...

333
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,510
Unluckily for us, incredibly powerful foes appeared.

334
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,850
Our whole crew was killed in battle.

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,700
I, of course, died as well.

336
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,570
When I was alive, the Revival Fruit simply made me unable to swim...

337
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,680
However, that day the fruit became more than just that!

338
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,420
My soul...

339
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,220
Has returned from the underworld to this world!

340
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,200
If I was able to find my body quickly, I would have been revived.

341
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,930
However, as you can see, the fog makes this sea difficult to navigate.

342
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,470
I became lost!

343
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,570
I searched for my body as a lost soul for an entire year.

344
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,490
And finally, I found it!

345
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,460
However, my body had been reduced to nothing but bones!

346
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,130
When I saw it, my eyes widened very much in surprise...

347
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
Although I have no eyes!

348
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,590
You're so stupid!

349
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,370
You got lost just like Zoro!

350
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,940
Hey.

351
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,130
So that's when you became a talking skeleton?

352
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,640
I didn't know a devil fruit could even bring someone back to life...

353
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,240
But even after you come back to life, you're still unable to swim,

354
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,450
so now you're just cursed.

355
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,180
But normally hair can't grow on bones...

356
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,290
I've never seen a skeleton with an afro before.

357
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,520
Oh, I just had strong roots.

358
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,270
Whatever you say...

359
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,720
So, that means you aren't a ghost?

360
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,460
You're human?

361
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,160
Even though you're not really...

362
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Yes, I dislike ghosts myself!

363
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,030
If I see one, I cry out in fear!

364
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,350
Have you ever looked in a mirror?

365
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,620
No, not a mirror!

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,950
H-Hey, w-wait a s-sec!

367
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,720
Y-You...

368
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,690
Why don't you...

369
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,670
Why don't you have a reflection in the mirror?!

370
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,380
A vampire?!

371
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,420
Really?!

372
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,900
Awesome!

373
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,130
N-Now that you mention it,

374
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,140
You don't have a shadow either!

375
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,420
He's right!

376
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,870
What are you really?!

377
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,200
Why are you so calm?

378
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,550
W-We're all really scared here! Because of you!

379
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,140
I'll tell you this.

380
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,490
I've been traveling this sea for so many years...

381
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:55,370
However, me being a skeleton and having no shadow are two unrelated matters.

382
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,390
To be continued.

383
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,870
No, tell us now!

384
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,440
My shadow was stolen from me years ago.

385
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,580
Stolen?

386
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,950
Your shadow?

387
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,580
After seeing you here living and talking, I'm not really surprised by anything you say...

388
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,790
But can that really happen?

389
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,950
Yes, it can.

390
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:25,060
Having my shadow stolen from me means that I am no longer able to exist in the world's light.

391
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,180
If I were to be hit with the light of the sun...

392
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,030
My body would...

393
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,920
My body would disintegrate!

394
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,450
I once saw...

395
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:51,160
Someone with this same curse disappear when bathed in sunlight...

396
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,300
It was enough to make my hair stand on end!

397
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,490
Although I'm a skeleton.

398
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,570
A shadow is reflected on the ground by sunlight.

399
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:11,480
Therefore, I myself cannot be reflected in something like a mirror or photograph.

400
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,950
And here I exist, unable to be in light, with all my crewmates long dead!

401
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,200
Your life's been pretty miserable.

402
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,860
But I lived through it all!

403
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,600
Even though I'm just bones.

404
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,840
I'm "Just Dead Bones" Brook!

405
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,060
It's a pleasure to meet you!

406
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,790
Why're you so happy?

407
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,840
Hey hey, what's wrong?

408
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,470
You okay?

409
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,850
Today is such a marvelous day!

410
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,800
I've seen people once more!

411
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,980
For so many years I've sailed through this ocean,

412
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,680
The fog making it so dark I couldn't even tell when the days passed...

413
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,060
All my crewmates were dead...

414
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,190
I was all alone on a ship that couldn't steer...

415
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,060
Sailing aimlessly for many, many years...

416
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,070
I was so lonely!

417
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,870
So very lonely,

418
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,610
And so very scared...

419
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,570
I just wanted to die...

420
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,480
But I lived on...

421
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,510
People are my happiness!

422
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,390
All of you are my joy!

423
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,060
I'm so happy that I would cry if I were able!

424
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,790
You asked me to join your crew, correct?

425
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,920
That made me very happy, thank you very much.

426
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,560
However, I must refuse your offer.

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,500
Why?!

428
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,870
As I told you before, my shadow was stolen, and I am unable to return to the light of the world.

429
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,640
Right now I'm being protected by the fog of this devils' sea.

430
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
However,

431
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,250
If I were to leave this ocean with you, it would only be a matter of time before my body disappeared. {should this and the previous line be merged?}

432
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,590
I'll stay here, waiting for the joyous day when I can regain my shadow!

433
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,490
What are you going on about?!

434
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,200
If you need your shadow, I'll get it back for you.

435
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,320
You said someone stole it, right?

436
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,070
Who was it?

437
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,140
Where is he?

438
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,960
You are a very kind person.

439
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm surprised...

440
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,650
However, I won't tell you.

441
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,790
I can't tell you, who I've just met, to go and die for me.

442
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,440
Is the enemy really that strong?

443
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,930
That's fine, but can't you at least tell us his name?

444
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,840
No, I cannot.

445
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,800
You may find him if I do!

446
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,780
I don't know if I will find him before my second life is over.

447
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,860
If I do find him, I've decided I will fight him, but...

448
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,370
That aside...

449
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,240
Let's sing a song.

450
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,730
Music is my pride!

451
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,460
I was the musician on my crew.

452
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,300
Really?!

453
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,050
You're a musician?!

454
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,090
Then you've really gotta join our crew, idiot!

455
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,100
Let's sing a fun song together!

456
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,690
Hey, what is it?

457
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,410
What's wrong?

458
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,390
G-G-G...

459
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,810
Ghost!

460
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,110
There's something there!

461
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,350
I'm scared, there's a ghost!

462
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,660
Cool!

463
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,290
I'm getting out of here!

464
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,340
Why're we shaking?

465
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,090
No... it can't be...!

466
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,330
What a thing to happen...!

467
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,300
Those guys're watching this ship?!

468
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,150
Please look!

469
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,610
This ship is being blocked!

470
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,080
This is what caused that shaking!

471
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,450
This is the back of the gate...

472
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,650
Gate?

473
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,080
Which means...!

474
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,690
Look at the back of the ship!

475
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,730
What is it?

476
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,570
Did you, perhaps, pick up a floating barrel...?

477
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,910
We did!

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,980
That was a trap!

479
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,150
This ship has been targeted since then.

480
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,680
What do you mean?

481
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,290
We've been right here the whole time...

482
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,210
Why is there an island there?

483
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,930
That is the wandering ghost island...

484
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,900
Thriller Bark.

485
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,190
Hold on...

486
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,730
The log pose isn't reacting at all!

487
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,100
That's correct.

488
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,620
It is because this island traveled here from the distant West Blue.

489
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,010
Oh, but today is such a lucky day.

490
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,430
Not only did I see people once more, but my deepest wish has come true as well!

491
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,600
He's so light...!

492
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,460
Of course!

493
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,570
Since I'm "just dead bones", I have to be light!

494
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,280
Now please, find a way to go through that gate behind you and leave this place.

495
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,010
Do not drop anchor here.

496
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,720
I was so happy to meet you.

497
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,990
I will never forget your delicious food!

498
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,160
Farewell!

499
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,460
If fate will have it, let us meet again!

500
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,160
Hey, wait, Brook!

501
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,800
Didn't he eat a devil fruit?!

502
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,930
What are you doing?!

503
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,420
He's running on the water!

504
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,600
Woah, cool!

505
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,020
A-Anyway, Luffy...

506
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,000
Let's do what he said!

507
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,230
We don't know what's going on here, but we do know that it's dangerous!

508
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,770
Did you say something?

509
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,140
He's going!
