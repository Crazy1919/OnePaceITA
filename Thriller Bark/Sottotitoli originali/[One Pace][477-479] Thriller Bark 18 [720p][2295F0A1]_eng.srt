raising our battle cry.

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,210
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,610
ring out.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,320

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,960
ring out.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,530
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,040
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,810
Because of that

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,480
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,750
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,690
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,060

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,620
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,960
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,290
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,630
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,800
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,130
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,490

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,580
I can't-

41
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,550
Good work, Robin!

42
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,100
Is this how you intend to stop me?

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,720
Such a pointless act.

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,740
Brick Bat!

45
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,990

How dare you hurt Robin-chan!

52
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,940
Moriah's shadow?

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,410
Now then, shall we fight to decide which is the best ability?!

54
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,480
This hold of yours is quite effective!

55
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,770
I shouldn't pay attention to his shadow.

56
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,400
If I bring down the body, the shadow will surely be annihilated as well.

57
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,960
Cuatro Manos!

H-Hey, you!

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,610
What're you-

61
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,980
Stop!

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,990
Clutch!

63
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,500
She did it!

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,760
You're amazing, Robin!

65
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,480
Hey, Robin! Look out for the shadow behind you!

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
What is Moriah doing here?!

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,480
Pretty close.

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,850
But it's a shame for you,

69
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,040
I can switch places with Doppelman any time I want.

70
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Switch places?

71
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,780
Then, the one over there is...

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,750
Your judo armlock won't work on my shadow.

73
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,530
Yes, the same shadow that was here a while ago!

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,430
Robin-cha-

75
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,460
Now it's three down!

76
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,600
Robin's shadow was also taken!

77
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,020
I don't have a marionette for you right now, so I might just keep you with me.

78
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,710
Diable Jambe...

81
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,220
Give back Robin-chan's shadow!

82
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,320
Extra Hachis!

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,610
He switched places with his shadow again?!

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,290
Then, that means...!

87
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,520
Moriah's back in Oars' stomach again!

88
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,300
And now you're back to where you started.

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,400
Damn it, Master!

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,300
Stop messing with my fight!

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,020
My bad, Oars.

92
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,240
I got a bit carried away it seems.

93
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,340
I better finish off that woman.

94
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,460
Rubber...

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,970
He's able to stretch again!

96
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,130
No way!

97
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,750
Robin isn't conscious anymore!

98
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,960
Sanji! Robin! Run for it!

99
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,280
Bazooka!

100
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,130
Diable Jambe...

101
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,920
Frit Assorti!

102
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,920
{\an8}Fried Assortment

103
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
He deflected it!

104
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,700
Now is our chance!

105
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,520
Take Robin-chan away!

106
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,650
Leave it to me!

107
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,470
Hey!

108
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,710
Sanji!

109
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,660
Zoro!

110
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,560
Chopper, what're you doing there?!

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,400
I was searching for Oars' cause of death five hundred years ago.

112
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,870
Cause of death?

113
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,650
Aim for his right arm!

114
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,240
This is not Oars' original arm!

115
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,020
Although it was restored by Hogback's amazing skills,

116
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,010
The joints show remains of terrible frostbite.

117
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,060
I can't tell for sure, but...

118
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,720
The cause of his death, 500 years ago, was most likely of freezing.

119
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,050
Despite being such a monster, he was no match to the forces of nature.

120
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,030
He froze to death as he wandered through the Ice Country.

121
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,060
The reason is that, even five hundred years ago, Oars was still...

122
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,220
Naked!

123
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,270
I can't believe we're losing to such an idiot!

124
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,850
Zombies may not feel pain, but the damage received remains.

125
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,840
All of the attacks he's received have been accumulating!

126
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,810
If we get rid of this arm, his strength will be halved!

127
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,620
Anyway, aim for this spot-

128
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,150
Quit babbling, you tiny man on my shoulder!

129
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,990
Chopper!

130
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,540
A zombie like you can't even realize how much that punch just now hurt your body!

131
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,410
He's in my hand.

132
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,670
With my current size, the gap in your fist feels like a huge cave!

133
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,530
Rumble...

134
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,170
Jumping Point!

135
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,470
Arm Point!

136
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,400
Chopper!

137
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,020
Nice job!

138
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,420
Let me give you a hand!

139
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,210
Sanji, I'm counting on you!

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,600
ArmÃ©e de l'Air...

141
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,600
{\an8}Air Force

142
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,520
Carving Hoof!

143
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,870
Roseo Shoot!

144
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,870
{\an8}Cherry Blossom Shoot

145
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,410
You bastard!

146
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,320
Why do you insist on attacking the same spot?!

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,390
If it didn't work before, it won't work now!

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,770
It will work.

149
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,540
Pain is a signal to protect the body.

150
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,590
Not having it... doesn't make you any stronger at all!

151
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,830
Say whatever you want then!

152
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,570
Hey, it's dangerous, you two!

153
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,470
Get away quickly!

154
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,040
Rubber...

155
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,240
Damn it.

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,890
This is bad.

157
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,420
Gatling!

158
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,570
Sanji!

159
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,980
Chopper!

160
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,600
Another two...

161
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,800
Everyone... is being eliminated.

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
Damn it!

163
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,810
Four!

164
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,450
Five!

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,120
And only three remain!

166
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,020
Only... three remain.

167
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,200
Now, hurry up and crush them, Oars!

168
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,270
He's coming!

169
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,780
It's useless!

170
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,380
We can't possibly win against such a monster!

171
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,580
We're out of options!

172
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,650
What should we do?!

173
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,580
Usopp!

174
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll create an opening.

175
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,070
I see!

176
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,790
I get it!

177
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,400
Alright then!

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,660
What do you mean, Usopp?!

179
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,660
Rubber...

180
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,820
Pistol!

181
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,140
Damn it!

182
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,870
Three Swords Style...

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,330
Demon Crow!

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,620
Did we do it!?

185
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,680
Did it work!?

186
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,820
Usopp, now is-

187
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,580
Attacking my right arm again?!

188
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,360
I've told you countless times; it won't work!

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,250
I'll get rid of you!

190
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
He disappeared!

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,720
Zoro!

192
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,380
Hey, Oars!

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,250
Look this way!

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,060
What?

195
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,090
Something... went into my mouth.

196
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,140
Usopp, what was that?

197
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,630
I did it.

198
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,530
I finally did it!

199
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,460
I finally made Oars swallow the salt!

200
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,660
Salt?

201
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,290
What of it?

202
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,850
I see, you didn't know.

203
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,340
Salt is the zombie's weakness!

204
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,810
Look! This is it for Oars!

205
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,420
Luffy's shadow is coming out!

206
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,250
Get purified, monstrous zombie!

207
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,110
The victory is mine!

208
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,090
Come out!

209
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,860
Why... is Moria's shadow...?

210
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,150
I'm protecting him from the inside!

211
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,800
What a simpleton.

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,710
Celebrating victory prematurely.

213
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,000
Did you actually think I wouldn't have a countermeasure for such a weakness?

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
Idiot!

215
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,340
Damn!

216
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,570
I think this is yours, Long-nose!

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,390
Usopp!

218
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,980
No good, the salt!

219
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,620
The salt Brook gathered for us!

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,940
Damn! Damn!

221
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,220
Making fun out of us!

222
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,230
Rubber...

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
Stamp!

224
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,070
Usopp!

225
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,970
Usopp!

226
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,810
Stop!

227
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,730
Stop it!

228
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,720
Usopp!

229
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,370
Usopp!

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Stop it!

231
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,470
Not yet!

232
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,050
Smash him to pieces!

233
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,070
The same goes for the woman!

234
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,630
Crush them! Crush them!

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,170
Crush every single one of them!

236
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,870
Crush the ones who're already unconscious too!

237
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,130
There's still a bit of breath in them!

238
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,680
Smash them until they're no longer recognizable as humans!

239
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,060
Hey, big idiot.

240
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,460
What do you think you are stomping?

241
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,500
Nobody is under your foot.

242
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,810
Who're you?

243
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,730
I'm... I'm...

244
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,020
Was I saved?

245
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,070
I don't know what happened, but...

246
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,570
Thanks for helping us out ther-

247
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,090
No way!

248
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,230
Monkey D. Luffy!

249
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,480
L-Lu-

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,580
Lu-

251
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
Luffy!?

252
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,280
Which part?!

253
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,850
You somewhat...

254
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,580
You somewhat resemble him, but...!

255
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,010
Is it really you?!

256
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,580
Are you serious!?

257
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,280
It is... really me.

258
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,320
Well, your way of talking matches.

259
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,790
What happened to you?!

260
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,370
Does he also have the ability to transform?

261
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,790
Or...?

262
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,460
Was everyone defeated?

263
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,470
Y-Yes.

264
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,180
Except for us, everyone else got beaten up by that monster.

265
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,250
I see.

266
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,170
Step aside.

267
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,840
Step aside!?

268
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,620
Don't you understand, Luffy?!

269
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,500
That zombie possesses your shadow!

270
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Furthermore, his body can stretch and perform your techniques too!

271
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,460
It doesn't matter.

272
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,220
Crush them, Oars.

273
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,350
Of course!

274
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,930
Rubber...

275
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,420
Here he comes!

276
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,170
Rifle!

277
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,680
The only Luffy...

278
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,020
is me!

279
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,620
Something is flying this way!

280
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,360
What is it?

281
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,260
A rain cloud?

282
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,260
No way!

283
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,730
It's Oars!

284
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,190
Damn it...

285
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,690
What?!

286
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
He's doing it!

287
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,410
He's fighting equally with Oz!

288
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,810
Now is our chance! Start searching!

289
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,580
H-Hey!

290
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,550
I found a member of the Crew of Hope!

291
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,510
Here too!

292
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,620
What a horrible wound.

293
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,320
Everyone was beaten up badly.

294
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,740
This guy was beaten to the point that his bones are visible!

295
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,920
It's dangerous to leave them here.

296
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,760
Take them somewhere safe, quickly!

297
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,010
What are they doing?

298
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,000
There's so many of them.

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,620
Are they zombies?

300
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,090
What're they gonna do with Zoro and the others?!

301
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,690
Let's hurry back!

302
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,210
Hey, hey!

303
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,820
What's going on here?

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,750
Oars is losing!

305
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,980
I can't believe such a monster is losing.

306
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,670
What's wrong, O-Oars?!

307
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,410
Hey! Have you heard?!

308
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,430
Moriah-sama is currently inside Oars' belly!

309
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:22,810
Then, the master of all the zombies in Thriller Bark is being beaten, along with the ultimate Special Zombie?!

310
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,280
What kind of joke is this?!

311
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,200
Oars... the legendary man who 500 years ago was called a demon!

312
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
And our master is a Royal Warlord of the Sea!

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
Gekko Moriah-sama!

314
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,970
What?!

315
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,640
So by stuffing Luffy with the shadows of
100 victims, you made him look like that?!

316
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,670
That's correct, Crew of Hope.

317
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,230
To be honest, we're surprised about how much power he has acquired!

318
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,200
But... that strength will only last 2 or 3 more minutes!

319
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,870
The shadows we placed in him will begin to leave his body!

320
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,860
We're sorry for messing with your captain, but...

321
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,930
We've entrusted him with all of our hope!

322
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,830
We want to be humans again!

323
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,150
He's our last hope!

324
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
It's nearly daybreak.

325
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,210
The fate of all the island's victims will be decided within the next few minutes.

326
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
We're counting on you, Nightmare Luffy.

327
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,490
The mansion is breaking apart!

328
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,900
Hurry and escape!

329
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,650
This is really amazing.

330
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,090
Alright!

331
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,240
Way to go, Luffy!

332
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,830
You bastard!

333
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,620
Insignificant scum!

334
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,300
Rubber...

335
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,060
Bullet!

336
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,330
Damn you, Oars!

337
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,520
Where did Straw Hat acquire such power?!

338
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,730
Damn!

339
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,150
I might get involved in this.

340
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,750
I better get out of the cockpit for no-

341
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,750
Rubber...

342
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,260
Pistol!

343
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,270
Rubber...

344
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,070
Battle Axe!

345
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,650
Rubber...

346
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,790
Storm!

347
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,600
Oars is being...!

348
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,820
Moriah-sama!

349
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,280
He's coming down, be careful!

350
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,460
The shadows... are coming out.

351
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,880
Hey, is Luffy gonna be alright?

352
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,940
Luffy!

353
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,090
Hey! Are you alright?!

354
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,360
Am I dreaming?

355
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,560
He won.

356
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,320
Yes, the Crew of Hope has done it!

357
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,480
Oars and Moriah have been defeated!

358
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,290
Everyone's shadow will return!

359
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,580
Thriller Bark...

360
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,180
has fallen!
