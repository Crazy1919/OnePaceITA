raising our battle cry.

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,200
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,580
ring out.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,300

raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,500
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,920
ring out.

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,510
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,020
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,810
Because of that

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,480
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,740
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,660
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,060
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,380
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,760
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,400
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,610
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,940
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,280
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,610
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,790
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,480
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,260

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,720
That's one amazing tremor!

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,780
The ship could be caught in some weird current...

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,370
It's probably your fault.

42
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,840
Now then, what business do you have here?

43
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,700
Why did you come?

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,660
Yeah, you ripped off my shadow a while ago.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,090
I want it back.

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,020
Also Zoro's,

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,100
and Sanji's,

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,860
and Brook's,

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,320
and the zombie old man's.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,420
All of them!

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,950
Quite a greedy guy.

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,120
And what're you planning on doing?

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,100
I'll kick your ass!

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,730
Kick my ass?

55
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,690
Yeah, that's right.

56
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,320
If you defeat or kill me, that would just leave the zombies without their master.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,430
The shadows won't come out.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,310
My devil fruit ability is to rule over the shadows.

59
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,670
In order for your wish to be granted, this is what you do...

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:04,540
The current owners of the shadows must hear me give the order, "Go back to your Master."

61
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,010
Just by doing that, every shadow will return?

62
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,520
That's right! Simple, isn't it?

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,610
You can weaken me to the point of doing so, but...

64
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,370
With your current strength I seriously doubt you can even touch me.

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,010
Alright.

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,080
Rubber...

67
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,180
Pistol!

68
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,500
A shadow?

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,210
Let's see you win...

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,500
Against my clone,

71
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,220
Doppelman!

72
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,990
Long ago, I too was overconfident in my abilities and ambition.

73
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,500
Until I finally realized the need to have many more subordinates.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,390
Who is this guy?

75
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,610
Hey! Move!

76
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,600
I don't have to move a finger.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
Other people's efforts will make me Pirate King.

78
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,480
Your zombie said the same.

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,050
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,340
As expected from the shadow and body. Despite the difference in size,

82
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,580
He still reflects the strong will of its former master.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,450
But it won't be for long.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,490
Once he loses all memories of being you, he'll fully become my loyal zombie.

85
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,950
Regardless of how strong the will is, every zombie will end up showing absolute loyalty!

86
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,850
I'm taking it back now!

87
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,710
Rubber...

88
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,190
Brick Bat!

89
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,780
Gatling!

90
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,590
Damn! They're protecting him!

91
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,760
I can't hit him!

92
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,610
Don't worry, they won't suck your blood.

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Kick my ass?

94
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,150
Don't make me laugh.

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,070
Let go of me!

96
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,580
An inexperienced youngster always underestimates everyone else, and gets ridiculed in the end.

97
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,470
You bastard! I'm through with you!

98
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,140
Rubber...

99
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,450
What? He jumped down...

100
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,640
Are you running away?

101
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,100
Stamp!

102
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,780
That hurt, stupid brat!

103
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,880
Look!

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,700
I did touch you after all, giant leek!

105
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,050
Skip, skip, skip...

106
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,800
Get your...

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,100
hands off Nami-san!

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,140
Sorry for the delay, Nami-san.

109
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,360
Your knight is here.

110
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,330
Is this...

111
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,250
A Goddess?

112
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Ah, no, it's Nami-san...

113
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Definitely Nami-san.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,770
Without a doubt.

115
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,710
Ah, that surprised me...

116
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,860
Such beauty can be tricky.

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,190
For a second I thought I rescued a fairy by accident.

118
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,100
Geez...

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,670
What're you blabbering on about?

120
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,460
You're one of the crew members who was on the ship, aren't you?

121
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,680
A-An angel?!

122
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,370
Ah, no, no, it's a human.

123
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,470
No doubt about it.

124
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,650
That got me.

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,810
I don't blame you.

126
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,700
Not in the least.

127
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,090
Seeing Nami-san dressed in this snow white color is confusing.

128
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,650
Absolutely right!

129
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,690
What's with those two?

130
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,690
We're thinking alike.

131
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,860
Curse you, pirate!

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,880
I've no reason to get along with you!

133
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,950
Hey!

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,120
That could've hit Nami-san.

135
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,210
You should avoid attacking recklessly in a lady's presence.

136
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Good job avoiding that.

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,860
It seems you no longer have your shadow.

138
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,820
Come to think of it, there was this newbie zombie who had a strange attachment to that woman.

139
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,870
A rebel zombie with some ego still left in him.

140
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,160
That was probably your zombie.

141
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,210
The fact that he wasn't included among the General Zombies must mean that his real body is weak.

142
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,090
That overconfident penguin was actually pretty weak.

143
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,050
It's so absurd...

144
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,010
for a pathetic underling to pick a fight with me, a monster and commander of the General Zombies!

145
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,880
A-A nymph?!

146
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,660
That surprised me...

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,740
I thought it was a nymph for a second.

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,270
Now, I don't wanna get rough...

149
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,680
Leave that woman with me and go back to your life in the shadows.

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,490
I'm busy right now...

151
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,810
My strongest underlings were annihilated by your stupid captain's zombie.

152
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,580
And before that, I couldn't even give my bride the vow kiss...

153
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,340
Don't you get it?

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm terribly irritated right now.

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,970
I have no time to deal with amateurs like y-

156
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,370
Shut up, you Carnival-beast-face man!

157
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,720
Absalom-sama!

158
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,490
No way!

159
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,930
He sent that 300 kilogram body flying in an instant!

160
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,860
You must be the invisible man Usopp spoke of.

161
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,990
What's with that kick?!

162
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,110
Hogback improved my body with the power of the wild, and yet he blew me away...

163
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,810
Hands of the Dead!

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,320
What's the meaning of this?!

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,830
Did he know what I was about to do?!

166
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,530
Basse Côte!

167
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,530
{\an8}Lower Rib

168
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,280
Longe!

169
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,280
{\an8}Loin

170
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,400
You're that wild beast who licked Robin-chan on the Sunny, aren't you?!

171
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,650
Something grabbed me...!

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,950
You're the one who saw Nami-san completely naked in the bathroom, aren't you?

173
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,250
You'll be my bride.

174
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
Tendron!

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
{\an8}Collar

176
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,450
Flanchet!

{\an8}Stomach

178
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,360

{\an8}Rump

180
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,690
What's with his strength?!

181
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,960
Is he really just an underling?!

182
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,090
Queue!

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,090

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,980
Cuisseau!

185
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,980
{\an8}Thigh

186
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,630
Jarret!

187
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,630
{\an8}Shin

188
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,840
Why is she unconscious?!

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,380
You better not have gotten violent with her!

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,570
What marriage?!

191
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,330
Look at my eyes! I'll kick the hell out of you and make a croquette with your remains!

192
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,720
Damn! I gotta avoid him!

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,870
Skating...

194
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,180
Usopp's Special Salt Ball...

195
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,030
There he is!

196
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,060
What?! It's salty!

197
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,050
{\an8}Veal Shot

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,050
Veau Shot!

199
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,550
Impossible...

200
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,530
This guy doesn't even have a bounty...

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,630
You say you're irritated...?

202
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,700
That's nothing compared to me...

203
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,950
My body is exploding with rage!

204
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,060
It is!

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,940
And there's one more unfortunate thing...

206
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,510
You and I have...

207
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,430
A connection!

208
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,770
A-Absalom-sama...

209
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,030
You and I have a connection?

210
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,910
That's right, you're the man who stole my dream.

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
I don't remember you.

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,740
It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,340
Today is the first time...

214
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,590
I've ever met with you.

215
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,370
I'll blow you away!

216
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,180
With these Hands of the Dead!

217
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,480
Take them off.

218
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,900
I told you to take off those bazookas attached to your arms.

219
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't you get it?

220
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:35,000
If Nami-san gets hurt because of your mindless attack, you won't appear very alive when I finish with you.

221
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,670
He knows nothing...

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,940
I told you to...

223
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,170
Take them off!

224
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,060
What?! A bazooka suddenly appeared!

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,260
That's how it is, right?

226
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,940
That's a very clever attack.

227
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,330
You make your body invisible, and anything that comes in contact with your body invisible.

228
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,860
That's your ability...

229
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,950
The Transparent Fruit's invisible man.

230
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,830
I know everything you're capable of!

231
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,730
How is that possible...?!

232
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,290
Who are you...?!

233
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,220
Has that man met Absalom-sama before?

234
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,300
Why does he know everything about his abilities?

235
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,470
When I was a kid, I saw a large picture book about the devil fruit.

236
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,100
At first, I wasn't interested in all those rumors about sea curses, but...

237
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,140
while flipping through it, I came across a single item that caught my eye.

238
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,640
If I happened to find that ability...

239
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,570
even if I was to become cursed, I'd gladly eat it!

240
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,120
But two of the same fruit don't exist in this world.

241
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,480
If by any chance, I ran into the user of that fruit, my dream would collapse!

242
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,190
You get it now?!

243
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,730
I wished to become the invisible man!

244
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,200
That's why, the moment you ate the
Transparent Fruit, you crushed my dream!

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,530
He's right!

246
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,110
I wanted my dream to come true!

247
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,410
If so, with that ability I'd enter the...

248
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,290
women's bath!

249
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,040
No, I'd do something honorable in the...

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,020
women's bath!

251
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,170
No, I'd definitely help the people in the...

252
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,230
women's bath!

253
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,720
He wants nothing but to peek into the women's bath!

254
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,300
Shut up!

255
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,780
But thanks to many years of simulation, I know everything you can see-

256
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,770
No, everything you can do with that ability!

257
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,650
And if we add that you put Nami-san in danger, that means I'll definitely never forgive you!

258
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,400
Women's ba-

259
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,390
No! You better be ready to die!

260
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,730
What're you thinking?!

261
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,600
What a ridiculous connection!

262
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,330
That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard!

263
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,250
You're a...!

264
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,150
freaking pervert!

265
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,730
I don't want to...!

266
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,510
Hear that from you!

267
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,390
He's right!

268
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,660
But they're the same!

269
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,830
Very well!

270
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,510
I'll return your connection, your rage, everything back to you!

271
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,760
Not only do I have a lion's jaw...!

272
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,570
Elephant skin...!

273
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,230
Three hundred kilograms of condensed bear and gorilla muscle!

274
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:50,660
Implant after implant, Dr. Hogback kept working on me until I obtained the ultimate masterpiece body!

275
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,680
The Transparent Fruit is nothing but an bonus.

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,580
It doesn't even compare to the terrible strength I have!

277
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,040
Do you understand now?

278
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,140
But...

279
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,050
You still peeked on her!

280
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,710
It is true!

281
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,090
If it had been an ordinary kick, his leg would've been destroyed...

282
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,180
It's just as if my body was a regular human body to him.

283
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,690
But I'll have the last laugh!

284
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,490
You lost the ability you wished for and now even the woman you intend to protect will be my bride!

285
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,930
You've no chance to beat me in this state!

286
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,410
Back then, Nami disappeared along with him and we couldn't follow him!

287
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,210
You want to hide Nami-san, don't you?!

288
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,410
Over my dead body!

289
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,770
It's useless!

290
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,720
I'll show you the power of the beast man!

291
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,650
So you intend to sacrifice yourself for that woman?

292
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,550
Protect her then!

293
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,400
If you can!

294
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,510
Beast Man's Hands!

295
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,070
Beast Man's Legs!

296
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,650
Don't let go of her!

297
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,830
Sorry... Nami-san...

298
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,040
You let her go?

299
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,180
So you value your life over hers after all!

300
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,190
Sorry...

301
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,190
I don't wanna stain that snow white dress...

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
Damn... you just hide and sneak, you invisible man...

303
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,660
I don't give a damn about that dream anymore...

304
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,540
I no longer... care about being an invisible man!

305
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,860
I'll peek on my own!

306
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,460
You still wanna peek?!

307
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
Let go of me, bastard!

308
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,900
Let go!

309
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,970
Like I would, you filthy bastard!

310
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,670
If you're made of many beasts...

311
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,190
You'll make a fine minced meat!

312
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,820
Shut up! Let go of me!

313
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,700
Extra Haché!

314
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,700
{\an8}Haché: Mincemeat

315
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,870
Absalom-sama!

316
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,460
Women's bath...

317
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,690
No...

318
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,930
A beast's bride...

319
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,690
Ought to be another beast.

320
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,120
He's still following me!

321
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,920
If it wasn't for him, I'd have already beaten the other pirates!

322
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,650
Damn Nega-nose!

323
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,460
He's still following me!

324
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,930
If it wasn't for him, I'd have already beaten that hollow-hollow woman!

325
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,390
Damn bear zombie!

326
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,560
Wait...!

327
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,480
Stay away!

328
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
Wait, hollow-hollow woman!

329
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,980
Stay away!

330
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,220
Kumashi, hurry up and stop him!

331
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,010
Wait...!

332
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,250
Don't lay a hand on Perona-sama...!

333
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,750
Too close! Too close!

334
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,910
Perona-sama...!

335
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,530
What a terrifying power for a stuffed doll!

336
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,560
Take this!

337
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,880
Sure-Kill...

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
Blazing Ball!

339
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,830
It worked!

340
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,990
A zombie is a zombie after all!

341
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:25,100
Now, with this oil, I'll perform my
"You Won't Come Here Technique"!

342
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,970
What...?

343
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,260
Stupid bear!

344
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,160
You can't catch me now!

345
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,790
Now nothing is in my way.

346
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,540
Do you understand my power now?

347
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,600
Let's see now, I've got a hollow-hollow woman weaker than me that I must punish.

348
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,210
Where'd she go?

349
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,740
Over here, Nega-nose.

350
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,410
Maybe outside the window...?

351
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,050
Though, that's not possible...

352
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,170
We're in a pretty high pla-

353
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,100
Y-You...!

354
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,180
How come you can fly?!

355
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,250
You're supposed to manipulate ghosts only!

356
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,600
W-What's your real ability?!

357
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,860
You better not underestimate the Ghost Princess, fool.

358
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,950
I just thought of a way to get rid of you.

359
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,730
When I'm done with you, taking care of the remaining pirates won't be a problem.

360
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,570
Wait a minute!

361
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,510
I have a... bad feeling about that statement!
