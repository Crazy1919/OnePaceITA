If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
ring out.

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350

That feeling we had when we set sail

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

24
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,760
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,130

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,700
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,040
Spread your wings.

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,380
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,710
you will move on.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,880
Get all the treasures

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540
Give them all out at a big party

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310

You...

41
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,810
How come you can fly?

42
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,940
Such confidence...

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,420
You were running away from me a while ago...

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,020
Why the sudden change?!

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,200
I was a bit distracted a while ago.

46
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,030
I never thought someone immune to the negative ghosts could exist.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,580
I have only one thing to tell you...

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,190
Cheer up!

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,270
Shut up!

50
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,510
So what if you can fly?!

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,370
I'm a sniper!

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,240
Whether you fly or dance, I don't care!

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,420
Allow me to explain!

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,330
My new weapon Kabuto gains both range and stability thanks to these five axes!

55
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,410
When the Breath Dials I got from Sky Island are activated at the moment of firing,

56
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,420
rotation is added to the bullet, making all kinds of speed changes possible, creating a Super Pachinko!

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,330
Flame, flash, impact.

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,370
By changing the dials, I can make the bullets stronger!

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,080
No one can escape its abilities!

60
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,170
Now, prepare yo-

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,750
She's gone!

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,180
Where'd she go?!

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,920
Behind you.

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,100
Hurry and try to hit me.

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,440
W-What the hell are you?!

66
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,280
You damn...

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,190
Deadly...

68
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,880
Swallowtail Meteor!

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,780
She went back to normal!

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,700
You...

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm gonna shoot you down!

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Mantis Meteor!

73
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,540
Her hands are sinking into my body!

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,810
H-How come?!

75
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,550
I don't even feel pain!

76
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm...

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,150
Already... done for!

78
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,820
You fool, look closer.

79
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,960
There's no external wound.

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,490
My hands are just inside your body.

81
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,870
It means your death is at hand.

82
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,710
Right now, with my own hands, I'm going to...

83
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,940
crush your heart.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,950
Stop!

85
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,160
Please stop it!

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,420
That'd kill me for real!

87
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,180
I'm going to kill you.

88
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,150
Now...

89
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,270
Die in agonizing pain!

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,200
No!

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,450
Please stop!

92
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,770
I don't want to...!

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,280
Of course I can't do such a thing.

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,360
A bluff?!

95
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,080
I hit my head!

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,000
If I had the ability to do physical harm like crushing...

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
I hit my head!

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,500
You would have died the instant my hands went into your body.

99
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,210
Either way, this is bad for the heart.

100
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,710
I just went through...

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,690
Your body.

102
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,390
Even though you can see me clearly...

103
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,160
My body can go through anything.

104
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,860
Deadly...

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,810
Six Chain Viper Star!

106
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,630
Didn't I just tell you I can go through anything?

107
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
Stop!

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,870
It's creepy!

109
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,730
In other words, your attacks can't hit me.

110
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You bastard!

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,110
Go away!

112
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,870
Damn!

113
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,640
Stay away!

114
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,110
Go away, damn it!

115
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,020
What're you gonna do now?

116
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,260
Your attacks have no effect.

117
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,160
Shut up!

118
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,020
You bluffed about crushing my heart a while ago!

119
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,960
In that case, you can't touch me either!

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,690
You can't attack me either!

121
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,680
You can't attack!

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,510
Right?!

123
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,420
Mini Hollow...

124
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,290
W-What is that?

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,050
Ghost Rap...

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,550
T-The... wall...!

127
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,660
A-A blast...?!

128
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,390
Go away!

129
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,470
Rap...

130
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,100
You bastard...

131
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Deadly...

132
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,430
Fire Bird Star!

133
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,150
Damn!

134
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,590
This is so unfair!

135
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,490
I'm unable to attack her!

136
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,420
But she can attack me back!

137
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,720
What kind of matchup is this?!

138
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,000
M-Move!

139
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,810
I can't see what's in front of me.

140
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,810
Move!

141
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,090
Move!

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,230
Ghost Rap...

143
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,490
What's this...?

144
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,570
It's shameful...

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,740
I thought that woman was weaker than me!

146
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,330
Bear!

147
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,820
Be careful,

148
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,170
Kumashi's strength exceeds that of a common bear.

149
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,060
What's this...?!

150
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,570
No one in the crew could stand up against that woman's ability...!

151
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,310
She was supposed to be someone only I could defeat...!

152
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't...

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,310
You can't expect to beat her with your inferior abilities.

154
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,450
This was supposed to be my chance... but look at me...!

155
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,290
No use...

156
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,960
It's no use!

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,540
I have no chance to win!

158
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,610
If I'm defeated here, she'll go capture Luffy and the others, then the crew will be finished...

159
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,220
Saving them was a heavier burden than I thought...!

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,340
Save me...

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,650
Save me...!

162
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,190
Sogeking!

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
Please show me!

164
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,290
What would you do?!

165
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,250
{\an8}Oh, the wind carries my name

166
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,100
{\an8}from Sniper Island far away.

167
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,600
Kumashi!

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,730
Stop!

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,600
{\an8}When I take aim, it is straight and true,

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,550
You! How dare you hurt my Kumashi..!

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
{\an8}lu lu la la lu.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,420
What's with that stupid mask?!

173
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,750
{\an8}Whether you're a man or a mouse:

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,200
{\an8}Lock on!

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,950
{\an8}I will put your heart in my sights,

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,050
There's nothing stupid about it!

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,300
{\an8}Lock on!!

178
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,950
Pleased to meet you!

179
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,240
My name is Sogeking!

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,070
{\an8}The man who came from the Sniper Island...

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,900
Don't take me for a fool!

182
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,680
You expect me to believe you're someone else?!

183
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,040
Time to run!

184
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,690
And now you run?!

185
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,650
{\an8}Lu lu lu lu lu la la!

186
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,900
Calm down!

187
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,590
Fight, Usopp-kun!

188
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,670
Shut up!

189
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,970
It's no use!

190
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,030
I can't win at all!

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,440
That's not true!

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,300
You're the only man who can do it!

193
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,950
Do you even have a basis to support that?!

194
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,430
No.

195
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,930
So you don't!

196
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,630
Mini Hollow!

197
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,510
Just think for a second.

198
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,750
There's definitely something suspicious about that woman.

199
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,740
That's for sure...

200
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,610
That woman became so confident all of a sudden.

201
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,030
At first she was afraid of me and ran away.

202
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,230
If she was immune to my attacks, then she wouldn't need to run.

203
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,090
She could have flown or gone through walls.

204
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,760
But she was crying while running away instead.

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,590
Rap!

206
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,470
Rap!

207
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,990
The moment I lost track of that woman...

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Something happened...

209
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,420
Back when I was dealing with the bear...

210
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,220
That's when I lost sight of her... for a moment.

211
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,360
Well then, it's about time I take you to Moriah-sama.

212
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,670
That's it!

213
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,350
I've solved it...!

214
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,310
Are there any suspicious places nearby...?

215
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,680
Like a secret room...

216
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,070
Your trick!

217
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,440
What's that? Your last words?

218
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,760
Wait!

219
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,910
Where are you aiming?!

220
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,890
That's it!

221
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,880
Hey, wait!

222
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,490
Deadly Atlas Meteor!

223
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,600
I've found it!

224
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,480
That's your real body!

225
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,330
If you're capable of flying,

226
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,560
going through walls and people...

227
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,280
changing from big to small as you please...

228
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,580
that means your body is that of a ghost!

229
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,940
But when I think of how you ran from me earlier...

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,170
Stay away!

231
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,630
At that time you were in your physical body!

232
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,760
What do yo-

233
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
Which means!

234
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,080
The person before me...

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,790
Is merely a ghost you created while I took my eyes off you.

236
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,470
You've kept your body concealed in there!

237
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,810
You can't hide the truth anymore!

238
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,510
I thought you were just a negative idiot...

239
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,990
Did you draw courage from that stupid mask?

240
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,660
I'm surprised you could figure it out.

241
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,000
But you're only 90% right...

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm not a ghost that can be controlled by my body...

243
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
I become separated from it through Astral Travel.

244
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,630
A hollow that can think and act for itself.

245
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,440
I see!

246
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,130
Then, without a body to return to,

247
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,260
I wonder what will happen to you...

248
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,660
I'm sure you'd tell me not to attack it, right?

249
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,770
Bastard! Stop!

250
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,120
Deadly...

251
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,580
Great Explosion Star!

252
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,380
That was close...

253
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,130
You missed, though it was a dud.

254
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,590
One more shot!

255
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,870
Like I'd let you!

256
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
Special Hollow!

257
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,930
Is this a...?!

258
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,580
Mini Hollow...

259
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,210
Extra-large version of those things?!

260
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,270
This is bad!

261
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,880
Let go of me, bastard!

262
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,410
Struggle for a while.

263
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,800
I won't let you touch my real body.

264
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,280
Wait a sec!

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,620
Those dumpling-sized ghosts already caused insane damage!

266
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,680
If this insanely huge thing explodes, my body'll be blown to pieces!

267
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,200
Struggle all you want, you can't touch it...

268
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,230
It's a ghost.

269
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,830
Let go!

270
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,080
Let go of me, damn it!

271
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,220
It's a shame, Nega-nose.

272
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,250
When I snap my fingers, your body will be blown to pieces.

273
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,590
Kamikaze Rap!

274
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,720
It disappeared?!

275
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,260
That was close.

276
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,910
Your attack is now within this dial!

277
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,410
What do you-

278
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,810
I can't move!

279
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,020
What is this?!

280
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,260
The Great Explosion Star I shot you with was a lie!

281
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,930
It wasn't a dud...

282
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,990
It was my Sticky Substance.

283
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,410
That way you wouldn't be able to move even if you returned to your real body.

284
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,190
What did you say?!

285
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,560
Now I can take out both your body and hollow!

286
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Damn!

287
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,150
So you're the rat who purified Commander Kumashi?!

288
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,560
Just in time!

289
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,280
Get him, Vice-commander Noble-hippo!

290
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,050
Impact!

291
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,160
Is this guy... truly that strong?!

292
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,710
It hurts!

293
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,870
I'm gonna lose my arm!

294
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,250
Noble-hippo!

295
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,030
Deadly...

296
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,990
Black Luster Star!

297
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,170
Cockroaches!

298
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,640
Also called Cockroach Star.

299
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,290
Disgusting!

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,380
Someone get them off!

301
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,860
Help me!

302
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,170
I can't get away!

303
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,340
It crawled inside my clothes!

304
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,940
I hate cockroaches!

305
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,290
I'm scared, so scared!

306
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,400
Kumashi!

307
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,310
Don't get scared over simple cockroaches...

308
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,610
Your real nightmare is...

309
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,800
Me!

310
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,240
You underestimated me too much.

311
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,380
I'm a man best known in East Blue for my Super Strength!

312
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,700
T-Ten ton...?!

313
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,790
H-Hey, where did you get all that strength?

314
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,570
S-Stop!

315
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,340
There's no way I'd survive that!

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,530
That'd kill me, hey!

317
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,380
Take the cockroaches away!

318
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,480
Also take that hammer away!

319
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,140
Take the cockroaches and the hammer away, please!

320
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,850
Us

321
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,850
o

322
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,850
pp...

323
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,250
Stop!

324
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,630
I won't lay a hand on your friends ever again!

325
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,450
Really! Really!

326
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,440
Please! Please! Usopp-sama!

327
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,910
Golden...

328
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,300
Pound!

329
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,320
So, the Princess of a Haunted Mansion...

330
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,520
can't help but faint over a balloon and some toy cockroaches.

331
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,900
You were wrong...

332
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,070
If you thought you could beat me in a duel of negativity and lies!

333
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,550
Sweet dreams until daybreak!

334
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,130
Didn't that samurai just say something?

335
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,500
In other words...

336
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,260
what does this mean?

337
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,320
It means...

338
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,340
the match is over!

339
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,340
I've never seen a battle like this!

340
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,120
That samurai...!

341
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,750
never took me seriously!

342
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,300
{\an4}5 minutes ago,
at Hogback's lab

343
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,220
So you're going to take my famous blade Shuusui?

344
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,210
{\an8}Shuusui: Autumn Water

345
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,000
To be more precise...

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,770
I'll be taking the blade lying beside your corpse.

347
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,210
I see.

348
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,090
You seem pretty confident about it.

349
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,480
D-Don't provoke him...

350
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,410
You carry three swords it seems.

351
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,090
Yeah, but one is broken.

352
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,830
It doesn't feel right to just throw it away, so I keep it with me.

353
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,120
I'm a Three Swords Style user.

354
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,790
Three Swords Style?

355
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,650
Never heard of it.

356
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,930
Some kind of acrobatics perhaps?

357
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,860
It's a shame I can't show it to you.

358
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,600
That nose of yours would be broken already.

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,940
Probably... you seem rather strong.

360
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,760
An unfamiliar sensation is boiling through my body.

361
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,610
As if I were about to confront a huge beast...

362
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,070
What a strange feeling.

363
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,780
I'm very excited.

364
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,870
That surprised me!

365
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,740
Aubade...

366
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,740
{\an8}Dawn Serenade

367
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,280
Coup Droit!

368
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,280
{\an8}Straight Thrust

369
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,260
A-A pistol?!

370
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,450
A-A thrust!

371
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,470
Nothing like that ever happened when I used that technique!
