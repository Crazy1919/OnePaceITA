00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,470
Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,870
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,640
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

{\an1}Translation & initial syncing
Vegapunk Fansubs

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,890
along the boundary between sky and sea.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,130
Now we're rowing our way

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,640

raising our battle cry.

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,990
ring out.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,840
Because of that

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,510
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,780
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,720
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,400
while laughing out loud.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,800
Give them all out at a big party

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,440
making a splash...

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,650
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,990
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,660
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,830
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,170
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,520
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:38,690
{\an5}The Mysterious Visitor!
The Two Warlords Meet!

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,970
W-What a scary woman.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,760
We told her...

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,670
Everything.

42
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,720
But Perona-sama also loves treasure.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,600
That's right!

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
She won't be able to take it from her!

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,910
Treasure Room of Mast Mansion

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,900
{\an8}Then again, we told her about the shortcut.

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,200
{\an8}She got us.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
How conceited!

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,500
Not only is she stealing our treasure...

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,130
But she also plans to take the Sunny and escape?!

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,370
I'm not letting that happen!

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,750
Moreover, what's with this bridge?

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,920
Why is this the only thin part?

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,480
Although it's strangely well made.

55
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,130
I've had enough of you!

56
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,500
I will crush you all!

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,800
I didn't see anything!

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,560
You better get ready!

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm gonna squash you all!

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,620
No bone will be left unbroken!

61
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,540
He's extremely angry now!

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,710
Not good! Not good!

63
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,980
Here he comes.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,550
I can't move!

65
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,350
My horns are...!

66
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,930
Damn it!

67
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,070
My horns got stuck in the ground!

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,960
It's over...

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,330
You can't move, huh?

70
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,480
That sounds like Oars' screams.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,370
But... that's impossible!

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,520
Cut it out already!

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,900
Withdraw!

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,560
Right!

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,530
What cruel guys.

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,530
So flipping him over doesn't work.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,850
Look!

78
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,200
A mountain of meat!

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,170
What?!

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,110
Knee Crusher!

81
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,650
Making him kneel counts as a down?

82
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,770
Even if there were any rules, I don't think he'd play by them.

83
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,390
They did it! Totally kneeling!

84
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,740
Alright! Totally kneeling!

85
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,740
How humiliating.

86
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,720
We won't lose to you!

87
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,420
We'll just have to hold you until Straw Hat defeats Moriah!

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,100
Hurry and retrieve the shadows, Straw Hat!

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Why do we have to wait?

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,890
Let's beat him ourselves.

91
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,760
H-H-Hey! We're just holding off this monster so he doesn't go after Straw Hat!

92
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,410
Don't tell me you wanna beat this thing?!

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,160
First there's no meat...

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
Then they take me down to my knees.

95
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,220
Once you start a battle, you have to end it!

96
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,400
He's an insanely huge zombie!

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,370
There's no choice but to purify him!

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,570
He's right, Zoro!

99
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,530
Let's just buy some time!

100
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,840
If you don't like it, you're free to run.

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm not gonna wait for Luffy either.

102
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,540
Rubber...

103
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,270
Even if a dinosaur were to step on it, it wouldn't bend a millimeter.

104
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,800
I heard this black sword's greatest trait is its hardness.

105
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,120
This Great Grade Sword I just obtained, Shuusui...

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,120
{\an8}Shuusui: Clear Autumn Water

107
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,410
This is the perfect chance to test its power!

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,690
Wait!

109
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,060
Luffy's gonna beat Moriah for us!

110
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,430
Wait a minute, you!

111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,030
Who is that?

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,670
It's the pirate woman.

113
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,960
What're you planning to do with the treasure I was planning to steal?!

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,810
And with the Sunny?!

115
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,620
I thought it was someone else, but it's just the pirate woman.

116
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,820
Is your wedding with Absalom over already?

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,790
Like I'd marry that perverted, invisible beast man!

118
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,560
So you escaped after all.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,530
What a useless man.

120
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,780
So... what will you do?

121
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,930
It's true that I plan to take your ship to leave the island.

122
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,900
If you want to prevent that, you'll have defeat me.

123
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,510
For a weakling like you, this amount of mini hollows will be enough to tear you apart.

124
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,480
That nega-nose is my only natural enemy.

125
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,990
Who's that?

126
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,260
Perona-sama, run away!

127
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,200
Who the hell are you?!

128
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,410
We don't know who he is, but he's an enemy!

129
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,740
Just now, our brothers were erased right before our eyes!

130
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,400
He's no pushover!

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,210
He's dangerous!

132
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,160
Of course he...

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,450
is not a pushover...

134
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,490
He is...

135
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,690
One of the Royal Warlords of the Sea,

136
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,270
The Tyrant, Bartholomew Kuma.

137
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,900
A man who committed every brutality a pirate can.

138
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,160
No way! A Royal Warlord of the Sea?!

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,740
Impossible!

140
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,280
A man equal to Moriah-sama?!

141
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,750
Why's he on Thriller Bark?!

142
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,370
No way.

143
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you Moriah's subordinate?

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,820
M-Moriah-sama-

145
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,830
No!

146
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,600
Gekko Moriah has nothing to do with me anymore!

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,730
I-I was about to... leave this island!

148
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,500
If you were to go on a trip, where would you like to go?

149
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,740
He wants to chat?!

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,170
Why do you want to hear-

151
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,240
But if I went on vacation, I'd stay in a dark, damp, and evil old castle...

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,220
Spending my days singing cursed songs.

153
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,700
She answered!

154
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,410
As expected from the Ghost Princess!

155
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,560
I got carried away!

156
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,770
How dare you make fun of me!

157
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,130
I was overwhelmed by your reputation for a moment.

158
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,200
But I have no reason to fear.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,410
There's no human I can't make kneel with my ability.

160
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,680
Are you listening?!

161
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,560
Your shadow must be really powerful, Kuma!

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,000
I will defeat you and give Moriah-sama your shadow as a farewell gift!

163
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,310
Negative Ghost...

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,790
Plus...!

165
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,360
Special Hollow!

166
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,700
Here it comes!

167
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,670
Perona-sama's ultimate combo!

168
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,910
Judging by your actions...

169
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,850
I assume you aren't going to tell me Moriah's whereabouts.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,450
Where'd she...?

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,320
Where did you go, Perona-sama?!

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Perona-sama!

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
Hey, what's going on?!

174
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,310
Perona-sama vanished!

175
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,260
Bastard, what have you done to our princess?!

176
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,570
This is unforgivable!

177
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,320
We won't forgive you!

178
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,800
This is unforgivable!

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,490
He's too scary!

180
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,440
Run!

181
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,700
The Burglar Cat, right?

182
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,380
One of Straw Hat's crewmates.

183
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,660
Is it true that Monkey D. Luffy...

184
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,120
has a brother?

185
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,970
What?

186
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,130
He got here in an instant!

187
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,600
Did he warp?

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
It is!

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,940
You mean Ace, right?

190
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,170
What about him?!

191
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,880
I see. So it was true.

192
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,910
What do you mean?

193
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,230
Did you come for Luffy?

194
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,480
What're you after?!

195
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,580
Are you really a Warlord?!

196
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,920
Whatever I do... is my problem.

197
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,770
He's dangerous.

198
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,880
Is he after Luffy?

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,760
I must tell everyone.

200
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,630
I got you, Moriah!

201
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,120
You're not going anywhere, you bastard!

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,280
Now fight me!

203
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,910
And give everyone's shadows back!

204
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,910
A shadow?

205
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,490
Dawn.
The Shadow Recovery Time Limit Approaches

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,600
{\an8}D-Damn it!

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,490
{\an8}He tricked me!

208
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,500
You!

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,460
Wait!

210
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,060
Moriah's shadow!

211
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,460
Don't leave me here!

212
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,860
Where am I?!

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,550
Hey!

214
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,680
Damn it, this is bad!

215
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,410
I promised everyone I'd get all the shadows back.

216
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,870
I'm in serious trouble without mine.

217
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,020
Let's see...

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,170
What was gonna happen to me without my shadow?

219
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,960
That's right!

220
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,830
If we stay like this, we'll dissolve in the sun's light!

221
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,230
This is bad. I gotta hurry before the night's over.

222
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,410
Now, come.

223
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,980
I will be your opponent!

224
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,190
Fine.

225
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,180
The difference in weight is clear between this black sword, Shuusui, and its predecessor Yubashiri.

226
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,180
{\an8}Yubashiri: Snow Run

227
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,630
Hey Zoro, watch out!

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
With this weight...!

229
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,020
Incredible!

230
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,800
He deflected that punch!

231
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,210
Three Swords Style...

232
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,480
108 Pound Cannon!

233
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,460
It's huge!

234
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,440
Shuusui's strike absorbed the slashes of the other two swords to join into one!

235
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,810
But... it seems there's too much pointless destruction in the blade.

236
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,230
Proof that I've yet to master it.

237
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,070
Its destructive power is way bigger, but...

238
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,330
This is no easy sword to control, it seems.

239
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,150
You've given me something good,

240
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,770
Swordmaster Ryuuma.

241
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,130
You're not bad.

242
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,740
Had I taken that, I'd be history.

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,150
You bastard!

244
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,400
I'll crush you all!

245
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,880
Hey!

246
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
Don't attack so recklessly.

247
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,280
Even if you manage to defeat him, only Luffy's shadow will be released.

248
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,600
We don't even know where your and Sanji's shadows are!

249
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,270
But... if Luffy beats Moriah, we'll get all the shadows at once.

250
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,280
There's no point in hurting yourself fighting that huge zombie!

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,740
For now, just have faith in Luffy and keep this monster at bay!

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,250
I have plenty of faith in him.

253
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,220
Luffy also has his weakness, you know...

254
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,030
His gullibility.

255
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,060
An invisible man...

256
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,720
A ghost woman...

257
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,450
A ruler of shadows.

258
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,640
This island is infested with people who have such abilities.

259
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,070
Don't expect that they'll fight Luffy fair and square.

260
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,080
That is true.

261
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
Yeah.

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,770
If he fools Luffy and morning comes...

263
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,940
Neither he, nor I, nor the cook...

264
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,710
None of us three will be able to fight anymore.

265
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,880
But... if we can at least make Luffy go back to normal before daybreak...

266
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,690
He might still do something!

267
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,420
I don't think we even have thirty minutes before daybreak.

268
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,030
The fog is extremely thick in this sea.

269
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,400
It must be restricting the reach of the morning light by now.

270
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,240
So it's almost morning.

271
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,420
We're only alive because of this fog.

272
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,970
Whether it's morning or not, I'm finally starting to feel the danger of the situation.

273
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:33,980
W-What?

274
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,010
What's this shaking?!

275
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,390
What's this?!

276
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,690
Just like before, the ship is stuck in another weird sea current!

277
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,930
Hey, look at the sky!

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,900
I can see the predawn sky!

279
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,670
The fog has started to clear!

280
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,200
What's going on?!

281
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,420
Could it be... that we're already out of the Florian Triangle?!

282
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,490
It's Oars' fault for messing with the rudder before!

283
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,140
That bastard and his dumb games!

284
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,020
Moriah-sama!

285
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,990
Big trouble!

286
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,820
The Thriller Bark ship has come out of this foggy sea!

287
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,560
It's all Oars' fault!

288
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,560
Moriah-sama!

289
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,250
Leave it that way.

290
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,390
What's the big deal anyways?

291
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,660
We're pirates!

292
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,790
We sail up and down the seas as we please!

293
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,140
E-Even so...

294
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,300
More importantly; we have a most unusual visitor today, so be silent.

295
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,170
Isn't that right?

296
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,670
The Tyrant, Kuma.

297
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,590
The only man among the Warlords of the Sea that is truly loyal to the government!

298
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,160
You're very important to the government, but...

299
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,670
I've no idea what someone as uncanny as you could be scheming.

300
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,640
If you were to travel, where'd you go?

301
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,740
Hey, hey, stop it.

302
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,100
I'm fully aware of your abilities.

303
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,580
Have you come here to pick a fight?

304
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,700
Speak your business.

305
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,550
Why have you come here?

306
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,820
I have a certain matter to report.

307
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,110
The replacement for the Royal Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile.

308
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,310
His successor has been chosen.

309
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,650
You should've said that in the first place.

310
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,310
Who is he and what sea is he from?

311
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,430
There are countless pirates.

312
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,650
The name of the successor is...

313
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,890
Marshall D. Teach,

314
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,410
A man commonly known as Blackbeard.

315
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,990
Blackbeard?

316
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,680
Never heard of him.

317
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,560
He's a fugitive from Whitebeard's crew.

318
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,720
He caused quite an uproar around the world recently.

319
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,300
The news have yet to reach the sea of the mist.

320
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,640
He earned the title through merit.

321
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,280
So, what's his former bounty?

322
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,390
Zero.

323
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,860
I see.

324
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,990
An unassigned quantity.

325
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,530
It's impressive that the government acknowledged him.

326
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,410
Well, they must be at ease now that they've filled the gap.

327
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,280
Then I guess this means the world is keeping its balance, right?

328
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,250
No.

329
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,630
I think quite the opposite.

330
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,090
But that matters not.

331
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,970
More importantly, the government has a bigger concern right now.

332
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,540
Since the events at Enies Lobby... the actions of the Straw Hat pirates are being watched very thoroughly.

333
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,100
It was most likely that they'd be delayed here traveling from Water 7 to Fishman Island.

334
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,740
So... have you realized what the government's current concern is?

335
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,010
That yet another...

336
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,270
Warlord of the Sea will fall at the hands of the Straw Hat pirates.

337
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,240
That's what the government fears.

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,810
Don't mess around!

339
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,570
They're worried about me?!

340
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,340
Just because someone else got stripped of their title by some puny pirates...

341
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,520
they think the same will happen to me?!

342
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,620
If you can't take care of them yourself, I'm willing to help you.

343
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,520
Who do you think you're talking to, bastard?!

344
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,840
Do you actually think I'd lose to that insignificant and amateurish crew?!

345
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,150
In battle, nothing is 100% sure.

346
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,400
Back at Enies Lobby, who would have imagined that Rob Lucci could be defeated?

347
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,100
That's exactly my point!

348
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,320
Is the government so scared that they're sending two Warlords of the Sea to eliminate them?!

349
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,380
Huh!?

350
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm only here to report.

351
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,340
I did not receive such orders.

352
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,280
Then, just shut up and watch!

353
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,710
And also, give this message to that pack of know-nothings!

354
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,990
"The Straw Hat Pirates you're so scared of have easily been...

355
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,270
turned into loyal soldiers of Gekko Moriah's zombie army!"

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,460
The fog...

357
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,970
This is terrible.

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,170
That thick fog was our only ray of hope.

359
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,890
Who would have plotted for the fog to clear out at a moment like this?!

360
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,640
At this rate, we'll get burnt by the morning light straight on!

361
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,750
An unexpectedly refreshing night sky.

362
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,770
I-It's Moriah...!

363
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,390
It's Moriah!

364
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,390
Huh?

365
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,710
It's nearly daybreak.

366
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,830
Do you really have time to fool around?

367
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,530
Why're you here?

368
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,060
What happened to Luffy?!

369
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,640
Hey, what're you talking about, Usopp?

370
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,310
Where's Moriah?!

371
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,480
Are you blind?!

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,620
He's over there!

373
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,280
His belly...!

374
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,370
He's inside Oars' belly!

375
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,570
Inside his belly?!

376
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,710
H-He is!

377
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,190
Then, where's Luffy?

378
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,680
Was he tricked after all?

379
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,220
Or maybe...

380
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,920
Luffy won't fall that easily!

381
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,070
Found him! He's in a cockpit?

382
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,640
What, there was a cockpit in my belly all along?

383
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,870
This is really cool!

384
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,550
I'm somewhat like a robot!

385
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,750
Now, I will give you a chance to fight me.

386
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,690
If you defeat me, you can release all the shadows!

387
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,840
You can come at me all together!

388
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,080
But be aware that unless you defeat Oars, you can't reach me!

389
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,530
That bastard!

390
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,420
That's dirty!

391
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,580
We can't purify Oars unless we defeat Moriah.

392
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,290
But, Moriah is inside Oars now.

393
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,290
We've got a clearer target now, it seems.

394
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,260
Let's do it!

395
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,730
Usopp.

396
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,480
Since little portions don't work, go find a large quantity of salt and bring it!

397
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,450
That's the only way to purify Oars.

398
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,370
We'll do as much as we can to weaken him!

399
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,600
Alright, I got it!

400
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
I'll get it!

401
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,570
I'm sure there was a kitchen in the mansion!

402
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,580
There must be a large supply of salt in there.

403
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,710
Salt, huh?

404
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,670
Hey, Oars.

405
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,800
Eliminate that long-nose heading for the mansion.

406
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,250
Don't let him reach the kitchen alive.

407
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes, Master.

408
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,530
Damn it!

409
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,700
Usopp!

410
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
No good.

411
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,040
Now that Moriah is here, he's acting like a brain for Oars.

412
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,550
Usopp!

413
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,660
Where are you?!

414
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,860
Answer me!

415
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,210
He's safe!

416
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,760
I thought you'd need a large quantity of salt.

417
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,400
So I brought plenty of it!

418
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920
Brook!
