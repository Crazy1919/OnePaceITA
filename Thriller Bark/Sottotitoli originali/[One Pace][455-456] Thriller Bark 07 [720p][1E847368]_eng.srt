ring out.

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,310

If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

ring out.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,030
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,820
Because of that

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,490
nothing will be able to scare me...

Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,670
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

Fill your empty heart with dreams.

Spread your wings.

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,290
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,630
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,800
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,130
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,490
Give them all out at a big party

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,270

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,070
Despite cutting him, he's still a zombie.

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,430
He'll keep getting up!

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,580
You...!

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,080
Wait a sec... I've seen you before...

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,500
Worry not.

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,300
I've finished him off already.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,670
Finished?

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,900
These zombies have a weak point.

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,120
What is that?!

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,040
That's the zombie's soul.

49
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,160
Soul?

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,710
It's coming out right before our eyes!

51
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,070
Now, return to your master!

52
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,000
Commander Tararan!

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,230
The commander was defeated!

54
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,480
He completely stopped moving.

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,780
What did you do?!

56
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,040
Purification.

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,920
Look!

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,800
There's no doubt, he is the "Humming One".

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,100
He's the man who caused a ruckus in Thriller Bark five years ago.

60
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,350
Inform master!

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,840
This spider's web is indeed strong against physical force, but still weak to fire.

62
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,020
You're right!

63
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,930
It melted!

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,640
Straw Hat and the others were abducted.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,750
It seems you know quite a lot about this island.

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,500
Yes.

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,840
However, I'm not quite sure how to put this.

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,900
The fact that they've been captured means there is a strong possibility it may already be too late.

69
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,970
What?!

70
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,360
Too late?!

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,260
P-Please don't get mad at me.

72
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,030
Let's keep a straight face!

73
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,100
Even though as a skeleton, I don't have a face!

74
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,130
Skull joke!

75
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,130
Stop it, he's already dead.

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,000
Anyway,

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,130
Stop joking and listen to me.

78
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,680
Stop it, he's already dead.

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,880
It is as I told you on the ship, when my ship's rudder failed,

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,930
I began wandering the sea alone decades ago...

81
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,610
I thought of escaping this evil sea, but with the rudder broken I was just a puppet of the sea current.

82
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,230
That was more than five years ago.

83
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,830
And just like you now, I eventually was lead to Thriller Bark.

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,460
I wanted to leave the Florian Triangle no matter what.

85
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,190
Hoping that there might be parts to fix the rudder on the island, I investigated.

86
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,050
When I entered, I found nothing but zombies and monsters in the way.

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,020
Before long I was captured and brought to this building.

88
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:45,440
Inside I saw a combat dancer who was caught earlier and a patched corpse which they called a marionette.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,430
Afterwards, a terrifying and huge man appeared, and...!

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,490
He tore the man's shadow from the floor!

91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,290
He cut it off!

92
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,910
His shadow was cut off?

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,380
I thought my eyes were deceiving me... even though...

94
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,230
I don't have any eyes.

95
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,730
Stop joking or I'll kick your ass!

96
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,180
I don't mind if you do.

97
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,480
I was to have the same fate before long.

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,610
The one whose shadow was taken collapsed where he stood.

99
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,310
On the other hand, his severed shadow was pressed inside the unmoving body of the marionette.

100
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,210
I didn't think that was possible...

101
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,620
How he did it, I'm unsure...

102
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,060
But, the marionette corpse just...

103
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,250
Started moving on its own!

104
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,420
What do you mean?

105
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,800
A shadow is another soul that goes and moves along with you anywhere.

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,760
It follows you from birth to death.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,200
It's a soul that will never leave you, that will always obey and follow you.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,230
The man that seizes these, and has them obey his will is...

109
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,550
The Royal Warlord of the Sea, Gekko Moriah!

110
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,650
The user of the Shadow Fruit.

111
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,360
A devil fruit, huh?

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,640
As long as there's a corpse, he can use a shadow to bring forth a zombie.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:24,540
The problem is that the genius surgeon who creates these tough creatures, Doctor Hogback... has friends.

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,190
In some cases, he gets parts from different graveyards...

115
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,260
Using the corpses of legendary warriors to revive them.

116
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:39,180
Moreover, he has an immense amount of enumerated marionettes still stored in a freezer in his lab.

117
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,790
Dr. Hogback...

118
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:48,800
So that famous doctor came to this place after the incident of his disappearance to help a pirate.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,490
Then, the zombies' bodies can move, so it's not like they've been resurrected.

120
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,130
Correct.

121
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,640
The shadow holds both the personality and fighting skills of its owner.

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,900
The physical strength of the marionette is limited by the power of it's body.

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,270
When both strong shadow and body are merged, the result is an even more powerful zombie.

124
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,590
That is why Moriah so eagerly desires the shadows of bounty heads.

125
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,930
I see.

126
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,430
They were after us from the start.

127
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,690
So that's the whole story of Thriller Bark.

128
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,820
To Moriah, the zombie's most important characteristic might be obedience.

129
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,570
The stronger the warrior the harder it must be to make it listen.

130
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,530
True... they receive the same fighting spirit and skill as their owner.

131
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,250
The strong ones are set adrift at sea after they lose consciousness.

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,210
Then, they...!

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,170
This is bad.

134
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,470
They're safe yet.

135
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,680
We have time.

136
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,960
Right now I will tell you the best plan we have.

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,110
So please, trust me and do as I say.

138
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,760
Trust you?!

139
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,470
Skull Shock!

140
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,560
I haven't had a conversation like this in decades! It's so fun!

141
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,980
We're listening, so tell us quickly.

142
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,920
Okay...

143
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,300
Master!

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,610
The Three Mysterious Persons have arrived!

145
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,580
That was quick. Enter.

146
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,830
Please, come inside.

147
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,920
You finally came.

148
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,430
Make me the Pirate King.

149
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,020
Very soon.

150
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,120
You're no Pirate King!

151
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,600
The Pirate King will be...

152
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,640
Me!

153
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,770
Hey! Untie this string you giant leek!

154
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,680
Usopp, Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Zoro... Give them all back!

155
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,010
Where did you take them, leek?!

156
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,660
What a splendidly strong man.

157
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,890
So this is Straw Hat Luffy.

158
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,330
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

159
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,290
You mentioned many names.

160
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,210
We've only captured three of you so far.

161
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:16,210
The Pirate Hunter Zoro and a blond guy with no wanted poster.

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,760
Could that blond guy be Sanji...?

163
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
What?!

164
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,080
Hey, it seems Zoro and Sanji also got caught.

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,330
No way, and Luffy was also caught!

166
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,120
H-How come that monstrous trio got caught so easily?!

167
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,030
I don't know who these guys are, but they're definitely bad news!

168
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,240
By the way, what happened with those three, Perona?

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,290
The Risky Brothers were supposed to deliver them...

170
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,310
They didn't bring them to Kumashi.

171
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,920
Didn't they escape while they were being delivered?

172
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,740
They're talking about us.

173
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,510
Don't say it. You... Don't say it!

174
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,950
I told you not to open your mouth!

175
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,370
You're too strict with Kumashi...

176
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,560
Way too strict.

177
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,630
Anyways, I was trying to get a hold of my bride when those three...

178
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,110
Ran into your garden and caused a disturbance.

179
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,690
Hey, wait a second.

180
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,200
That means... Hogback...!

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,510
Bastard, do you mean that one of you laid a hand on my bride?!

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
So that's what happened before!

183
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,760
Your bride is not coming.

184
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,840
What was that, Cindry!?

185
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey! Hey! Cindry-chan, you're making it worse!

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,380
And why did you step out in front of me?

187
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,450
Yours won't be coming either.

188
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,850
What a low blow! Where did that come from?!

189
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,810
Stop! Stop!

190
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,930
Stop this pointless discussion.

191
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,730
If some pirates got away, then you guys can do something about it later.

192
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:01,070
I gathered you here to celebrate the creation of a great fighting asset.

193
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,170
Who is that guy!?

194
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,390
Master, that pirate bit the cage apart to escape!

195
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,850
He...!

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,510
Bit the cage!

197
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,840
What're you gonna do to catch me now?!

198
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
What a promising man!

199
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,220
Wait, Absalom, we're inside a room.

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,500
I'll stop him.

201
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,580
Like you'd catch me, idiot!

202
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,710
Negative Hollow!

203
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,570
If I were to be reborn, I want to become a sea slug...

204
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,430
The man who just said he wanted to be Pirate King now wants to be a sea slug...

205
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,580
Atrocious...

206
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,790
Turn the light on!

207
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,530
What're you doing, damn it!

208
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,730
You'll regret this!

209
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,220
W-What's that?!

210
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,550
My shadow...!

211
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,770
I finally have it!

212
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,830
The 300 million fighting power!

213
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,600
With this, the Ultimate Special Zombie can be created!

214
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,590
Go back to the ship?

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,870
To the Sunny?

216
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,470
Correct.

217
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:53,490
The worst case scenario is that your friends have been captured and their shadows have been stolen.

218
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,640
However, having their shadow stolen isn't going to kill them.

219
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,630
Take a look at what happened to me!

220
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,460
Ah, I died!

221
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,050
That's a different story!

222
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,070
Anyway...

223
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,260
In short, even if they got their shadow stolen, they won't die.

224
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,710
That's right.

225
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,560
However, the moment their shadows are taken, they become vulnerable as they lose consciousness.

226
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,580
And won't wake up for two days.

227
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,460
During this time they put those who are strong into boats and cast them off from Thriller Bark.

228
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,050
I've said this before but, do you know why they do that?

229
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,610
So that the victims won't attempt to return to the island and reclaim their shadows, right?

230
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,710
Precisely.

231
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,710
Then, why not just kill them while they're unconscious?

232
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,660
They cannot.

233
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,210
This is very important, so listen carefully.

234
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,550
First of all...

235
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,480
Although the body and the shadow may be separated, they're part of one being.

236
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,680
If the body dies, then the shadow is doomed as well.

237
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,010
In other words, the moment that happens, the zombie will also perish.

238
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,480
This means trouble for the enemy, so they make sure to keep the body alive.

239
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,710
Which means that, even if your friends have been stripped off their shadows...

240
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,640
They are surely alive and are being taken back to the ship.

241
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
That's why...!

242
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,770
If you two become victims as well, this will turn into the worst case scenario!

243
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,650
Everyone would've lost their shadows and will be left to wander the sea.

244
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,920
But something can still be done. If we wake up your friends...

245
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,420
We'll have one chance to figure out how to recover the stolen shadows.

246
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,370
Did you get all that?

247
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,180
I see.

248
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,840
That makes sense.

249
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,130
Take this, you two.

250
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,160
What is it?

251
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,550
The zombies' weakness.

252
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,010
It's effectiveness against the Spider Monkey is proof!

253
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,380
Weakness?

254
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,820
What is this?

255
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,810
Salt.

256
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,580
Salt?

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,920
So it's kinda like we're defeating some evil being by purifying it?

258
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,450
Well, you could say that.

259
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,510
The zombies are originally animated by the power of the devil fruit.

260
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,940
Just as the sea nullifies the abilities of a devil fruit user...

261
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,870
the salt which has the sea's power undoes the bond between the false soul and the corpse.

262
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,510
I see.

263
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,940
So that thing that flew out of the monkey's mouth a little while ago was the shadow from within his body.

264
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,110
To think they had such a weakness...

265
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,000
Now then, to defeat the Zombies, simply throw the salt into their mouths!

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,310
That's the trick!

267
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,770
The only trick!

268
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,860
The trick!

269
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,740
The trick, the trick, the trick!

270
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,250
But Brook...

271
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,120
Why is it that you happen to know so much about this island and the zombies?

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
When my shadow was stolen five years ago...

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,950
Naturally, I was cast off in my ship, but luckily enough I woke up in time to find a way back.

274
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
And then I returned to the island...

275
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,910
To fight...

276
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,920
The zombie that has my shadow!

277
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,110
But... I was completely defeated.

278
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,370
I shamefully ran to save my life...

279
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,370
No matter what...

280
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,500
No matter what... I didn't want to die.

281
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,440
Because I was the sole survivor from my ship.

282
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,410
Because I promised my friends that one day I'd escape from this Devil Sea...

283
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,870
I shamefully ran to save my life!

284
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,960
And though I managed to live a long while, I was unable to achieve any resolution.

285
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,470
That's why... I will not escape this time!

286
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,050
Until I beat that man and recover my shadow I-

287
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,030
Well then...

288
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,320
Please excuse me, I'll go ahead.

289
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,050
Have a good day.

290
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,770
Wait a minute!

291
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,030
While we're still at it, just answer me one more question.

292
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,130
L-Luffy!

293
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,360
What was that... just now?

294
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,290
His shadow...!

295
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,940
His shadow was ripped off!

296
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,260
It's just like the story that skeleton Brook told us.

297
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,020
If his shadow was taken... then that means this guy also took Brook's!

298
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,490
I can't believe it...

299
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,120
How come he can do such a thing?

300
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,830
Kumashi! You were blabbering again weren't you?!

301
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,670
You're too strict with Kumashi...

302
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,860
Way too strict.

303
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,080
This guy will bring me one step closer to being the Pirate King, right Hogback?

304
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,270
Since the day I met you ten years ago, I've served you for the day Number 900 would be made.

305
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,940
With that shadow we can create the greatest zombie ever made...

306
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,450
And without a doubt, it'll become a huge source of power for us!

307
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,850
The day that I will be known worldwide as the Graveyard King has come closer!

308
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,400
My dream kingdom where all the world's cute things will become zombies and serve me is before my eyes!

309
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,100
Even the most insolent bastard will become an obedient zombie if I take his shadow!

310
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,410
I'll turn this world into one full of obedient zombies!

311
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,640
If I had a servant like this back then...

312
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,040
I wouldn't have lost to that idiot Kaidou in the New World!

313
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,210
Let's wake him up already!

314
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,230
Gyoro!

315
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,860
Nin!

316
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,570
Bao!

317
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,320
Yes, master!

318
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,380
Open the door to the special freezer!

319
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,240
Right away, master!

320
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,350
Just you wait, 900.

321
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
Spider Mouse.

322
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,720
Dump Straw Hat Luffy's body on his ship.

323
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,410
And don't forget to remove the thread, it'll be troublesome if he dies.

324
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,530
Yes!

325
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,370
Please wait! I have a report!

326
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,860
What is it?

327
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,830
Just now, Commander Spider Monkey Tararan was defeated!

328
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,430
Defeated?

329
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,260
That's not possible, unless his shadow is extracted.

330
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,330
His shadow was extracted!

331
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,200
Absalom...

332
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,610
The only man capable of such a thing, is him!

333
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,520
The Chivalrous Humming Swordsman!

334
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,970
It seems the report Hildon gave me wasn't wrong.

335
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,020
This is terrible!

336
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,900
The Humming One has been freeing lots of shadows!

337
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,050
Before I knew it, there were countless victims!

338
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,870
At this rate, the nightmare from five years ago will be repeated!

339
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,850
Damn... He's the only man who could tell the zombies' weakn-

340
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,020
Huh?

341
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,630
How did he find out-

342
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,000
Cindry-chan, why're you standing in front of me?!

343
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,760
I've heard about him but... what is he like?

344
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,730
Perona, you don't know what he looks like?

345
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,180
Then, that's why he wasn't spotted.

346
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,520
Master!

347
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,660
That troublemaker has come once again...

348
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,120
Like I care about such a thing, idiot!

349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,650
You take care of it!

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,650
H-Hold on!

351
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,700
Now, on to the freezer.

352
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,280
Still, the current situation is...

353
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,030
Idiot! Say that in the first place!

354
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,520
In that case, we should be able to contain him.

355
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,170
Yes.

356
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,200
If there's a problem when he wakes up, report it.

357
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
Now go ahead and throw Straw Hat out already.

358
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,970
Yes!

359
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,780
Heave-ho!

360
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,020
Idiot, don't go out!

361
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,440
It seems being stripped of your shadow won't kill you!

362
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,310
It didn't kill Brook.

363
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,360
We can't go out yet.

364
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,320
We'll wait for our chance!

365
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,690
It seems like they're going to do something with Luffy's shadow.

366
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,490
We need to see what happens to it so we can get it back later!

367
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,200
Those two are no longer here.

368
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,530
Where did they go?

369
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,360
I can't believe they got Tararan.

370
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,900
Where's the enemy?!

371
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,540
I'll cut them in an instant!

372
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,210
Franky.

373
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,550
What do you want?! I'm not crying!

374
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,060
Idiot, don't look this way!

375
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,520
Why did you ask him... such a question?

376
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,910
Shut up! Don't mind me!

377
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,440
Dammit! I love that skeleton now!

378
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,740
There isn't a guy that good anywhere!

379
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,580
Damn!

380
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,010
You're right.

381
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,250
As I thought, you're not gonna give up by merely kicking you out.

382
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,630
Of course!

383
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,050
Don't you know my name?

384
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,450
Anyone who hears the name Swordmaster Ryuuma will cower in fear.

385
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,440
Silence!

386
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
You're my shadow!

387
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,180
There's a big difference between our bodies.

388
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
You shall return...

389
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,520
To my feet!

390
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,190
I can't wait!

391
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,700
Back when I saw his corpse in the Ice Country, I couldn't help but tremble.

392
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,480
It takes my breath away to think this repulsive thing rampaged through the seas 500 years ago!

393
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,080
He took the entire island of each country he conquered to expand his own territory...

394
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,770
Cold...!

395
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,630
And thus he built the so called Evil Country.

396
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,070
The very founder of the Country-Puller legend is right there!

397
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,010
This will be the best zombie ever create-!

398
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,780
The legend will be reborn once again!

399
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,050
Now... it's time to resurrect...!

400
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,440
The only man in history...!

401
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,990
The wild warrior that was called the Demon!

402
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,410
Oars!
