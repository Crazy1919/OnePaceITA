Let's pile up all the dreams,

00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,400
And go find the thing we're looking for... One Piece!

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,700

And pretend that it isn't there!

Let's pile up all the dreams,

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,720
and go find the thing we're looking for...

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,950
A pocket of coins, and

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,060
We are!

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,640
Let's break the tight-fisted night!

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,180
We have no interest in treasure chests

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,650
A pocket of romance, and

23
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,590
We are!

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,640
Let's pile up all the dreams,

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,270
And go find the thing we're looking for...

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,310
A pocket of coins, and

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,650
We are!

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,190
We are!

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,900
We are!

Robin!

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,910
Sanji!

34
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,780
Your bodies are vanishing!

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,640
Why?!

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,220
Didn't we win?!

37
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,360
Hey! Didn't we make it on time?!

38
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,200
She's disappearing!

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,100
Captain Lola!

40
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,770
Everyone!

41
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,710
Didn't we win?!

42
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,980
Damn it!

43
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,080
A pirate ship somewhere in the Grand Line

44
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,080
{\an8}Captain!

45
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,450
Come to the deck for a moment, please!

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,770
Stop babbling nonsense and go back to sleep.

47
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,130
We will get erased by the morning sun if we step outside.

48
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,440
It's been two years since Moriah stole our shadows.

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,970
We no longer...

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,490
But Captain!

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,660
Take a look at my feet!

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,200
You have... your shadow!

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,140
My shadow's back!

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Everyone else's too, Captain!

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,370
Everyone's shadows are back!

56
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,110
Captain, you don't think someone actually beat Moriah?

57
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,760
Don't be foolish.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,820
That's impossible.

59
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,290
Moriah is a pirate who once fought against one of the Four Emperors, Kaido, or so I heard.

60
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,980
I can't think of a guy who could actually defeat him.

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,700
Grand Line, as well as various places in West Blue

62
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,500
I've got my shadow back!

63
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,950
It's been such a long time since I last saw the sunlight!

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,110
Our zombies at Thriller Bark must have been destroyed!

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,630
Moriah's curse has been lifted!

66
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,280
Boss!

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,430
I see the morning sun!

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,460
Look at my shadow!

69
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,560
My shadow is following me!

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,700
My reflection is in the mirror!

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,770
Hey, what was that noise, Margarita?!

72
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,090
My shadow!

73
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,070
My shadow is back!

74
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,950
What?

75
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,260
You got your shadow back?

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,550
Your shadow that was stolen by pirates over ten years ago?!

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,480
It's true.

78
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,480
Master, please forgive me!

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,260
I was so surprised that I dropped the family heirloom plates!

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,550
I had a grudge against them, but not anymore.

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,000
I didn't mean to break them.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm terribly sorry.

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,980
I'll leave the mansion immediately.

84
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,990
What're you talking about?

85
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,130
They were just some plates after all.

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,900
Did you get hurt?

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,440
Anyway, let's celebrate.

88
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,930
I'm so happy for you, Margarita.

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,560
Aren't you happy?

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,890
Yes!

91
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,760
Thriller Bark

92
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,240
It seems we're alive.

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,380
For a moment, I felt like I was going to heaven.

94
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,450
That's fine!

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,280
I wouldn't mind going to heaven as long as it's with Robin-chan!

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,730
This isn't funny, you idiots!

97
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,390
We really thought you were dead! You were vanishing into thin air!

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,190
What a scary view.

99
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,120
The morning sun!

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,390
We don't have to fear the sun anymore!

101
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,530
We have our shadows!

102
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,540
Our days in that gloomy forest are finally over!

103
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,090
All right!

104
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,100
All right!

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,470
Everyone over there seems fine as well.

106
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,690
Our existence was erased for a moment, when the sun shone upon us.

107
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,250
But at the last second, our shadows returned. Thus our bodies were regenerated.

108
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,750
It's just like Moriah said when he transformed the shadow to change the body's shape.

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,960
As far as I understand, shadow and body must have the same shape.

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,770
Take it easy.

111
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,430
Never again will your shadow and body be separated in such a strange way.

112
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,600
Anyway, I'm glad no one was completely erased.

113
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,370
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.

114
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,310
Does anyone have cola?

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,500
All these weird creatures we've come across since we entered this island...

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,280
Were merely illusions created by Moriah.

117
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,820
Now that he's gone, there's nothing left on the island.

118
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,220
Everything disappears, like the morning after waking up from a nightmare.

119
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,200
Truly a devilish haunted mansion.

120
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,020
Wake up!

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,200
Absalom!

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,040
Hey, wake up!

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,610
Lola!

124
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,240
Don't panic.

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,580
It no longer has a shadow.

126
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Hogback.

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,320
What happened to me?

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,240
I have no idea what happened to you.

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,700
Beaten by someone I assume, pathetic.

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,320
More importantly, Moriah-sama was-

131
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,830
What?!

132
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,730
Moriah-sama was beaten by Straw Hat?!

133
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,080
Don't talk so loud!

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,470
Be quiet!

135
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,800
You're too loud!

136
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,430
Thriller Bark is nothing but a worthless pile of rubble now.

137
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,940
But I don't plan on spending my days as a loser!

138
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,780
What about you?

139
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,050
Me?

140
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,490
Didn't Luffy's body shrink a while ago?

141
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,160
Luffy's body shrinks for a moment as a side effect of that Giant Gear.

142
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,030
His new techniques are too much for his body, aren't they?

143
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,470
The stronger the enemies we encounter, the more reckless this guy will get.

144
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,770
If we keep going like this...

145
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,410
A zombie!

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,350
So there was still one left?!

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,930
No, just a heavily injured old man.

148
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,720
No way! You're practically a zombie!

149
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,930
It's that geezer we met at the graveyard.

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,010
I don't believe it.

151
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,170
I didn't think the day would come when we could walk under the sun again.

152
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,140
Thank you so much!

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,390
How can we ever repay this favor!

154
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,570
Hey! Old man Spoil!

155
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,410
Old man!

156
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,540
President of the victim association!

157
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,470
Oh! You guys are fine too?

158
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,050
Yes, are you?

159
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,430
Yes.

160
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,160
You know each other?

161
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,630
By the way, you two, where's your gratitude?

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,590
We too, thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,600
I apologize for all the sudden meddling and all!

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
It's just that when we saw you guys rampaging, we decided to take a chance, and place our hopes in you!

165
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,090
Thank you very much!

166
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,770
I speak for everyone in the Thriller Bark Victim Association when I say...

167
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,070
We will never forget this debt!

168
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,080
Thank you very much!

169
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,810
Feel free to ask for anything!

170
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,740
Though it's not much, we have plenty of food.

171
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,740
In return, you can marry me.

172
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,730
Hell no!

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,420
You keep thanking us, but...

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,630
Don't say that!

175
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,820
It's like Luffy said, old man.

176
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,610
You there!

177
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,590
We had our own reasons for fighting.

178
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,630
Won't you marry me?!

179
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,660
We just happened to help you by accident.

180
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,800
What're you saying?!

181
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,950
If they want to thank us so badly, then let them do it!

182
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,730
That's right, bro!

183
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,500
Ask anything you want!

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,330
Whether it was an accident or not, we're very grateful you defeated Moriah!

185
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,100
Is that so?

186
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,360
Um... Your eyes...

187
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,200
That's right! I completely forgot about it!

188
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
What's the matter?

189
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,510
I forgot about him!

190
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,140
Is something wrong?

191
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,230
We're in big trouble!

192
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,500
I see.

193
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,870
So it turned out as I feared.

194
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,430
It appears so.

195
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,940
Who's that over there?

196
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,330
He's here.

197
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,800
Stay calm and listen.

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I didn't want to bring this up while in the middle of the battle with Moriah, but...

199
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,810
On this island...

200
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,410
There was another...

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,520
Warlord of the Sea!

202
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,530
What did you just say?!

203
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,430
That's a...

204
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,030
Warlord of the Sea?!

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,480
Just when we finally found a replacement for Crocodile.

206
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,910
We can't afford to have another empty gap in the Warlords.

207
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,810
Is there still breath in him?

208
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,980
Who knows.

209
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,090
As long as there's a breath of life in him,

210
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,200
we will wait for his recovery and allow him to take up his place as a Warlord again.

211
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,590
We'll worry about that later.

212
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,100
If we keep losing one after another, the dignity of the Warlords will end up disappearing.

213
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,080
We can't let this information get spread around the world.

214
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,470
Seriously, what a bunch of troublemakers.

215
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,340
It's true... Even Moriah falls short of that giant's size,

216
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,340
That pirate known as "The Tyrant",

217
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,250
Bartholomew Kuma.

218
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,010
He is Kuma the Tyrant?!

219
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,220
Do you understand what I'm saying?

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,020
There must not be any witnesses of Moriah's defeat.

221
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,250
This is a direct order from the World Government...

222
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,850
The Straw Hat crew, along with any survivors on the island must be...

223
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,400
eliminated.

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,070
Simple enough.

225
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,540
What was that just now?!

226
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,370
Did he say "eliminated"?!

227
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,320
Hey, hey! Eliminate...

228
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,200
Us?!

229
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,920
Why?!

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
I can't believe this is happening!

231
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,390
Just when we finally got free from Moriah's power!

232
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,260
No way!

233
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,940
We have to fight two Warlords consecutively?!

234
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,420
You guys, step back.

235
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,880
I'll handle this!

236
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,160
Be careful! {Padding before this with breathing. Cut if possible}

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,300
He's got some sort of ability!

238
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,550
He completely let a person vanish just by touching her with his hand!

239
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,060
H-He vanished a person just by touching them?!

240
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,670
S-So scary! {Non-Canon}

241
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,100
Plus, he can move instantly from one location to another!

242
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,110
Those hands are dangerous!

243
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,040
What?!

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,170
He's here!

245
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,100
He's huge!

246
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,370
When did he-

247
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,100
Dammit! Just when we finally got our freedom!

248
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,370
Like I'm gonna die in this place!

249
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,740
That's right! We won't let anyone get in our way anymore!

250
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,220
Everyone, get him!

251
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,680
Yes, yes! Get him!

252
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,210
Stop it, you fools!

253
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,420
You're no match for him!

254
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,930
Even the guys who weren't touched were pierced by something.

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,180
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

256
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,250
I'll start with you.

257
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,540
Hey, hang in there!

258
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,170
Are you okay?

259
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,200
What the hell did he do?!

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,450
Something went through him without touching him!

261
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,810
That's his ability?

262
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,320
What a cruel thing to do.

263
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,610
Just when we finally managed to break free from our suffering in Moriah's forest after so many years.

264
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:18,020
We don't even have the chance to celebrate before another Shichibukai shows up to exterminate us all.

265
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,300
This isn't fair!

266
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,570
You don't know what the Straw Hats went through to finish this battle!

267
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,860
We will fight in their place, regardless of the odds!

268
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,610
Even if our enemy is a Warlord!

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,980
You're not as tough as Moriah or Oars anyways!

270
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,270
Shut up and stay back!

271
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,090
He's after me, didn't you hear him?

272
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,380
I'll take him on.

273
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,320
I don't need your help.

274
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,100
Don't humiliate me.

275
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,090
You people have quite a reputation.

276
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,030
Straw Hat's ship sure is full of exceptional people.

277
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,410
This isn't the time to feel flattered!

278
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,440
You've caused too many disturbances.

279
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,380
It's not just your captain; your whole crew has become quite noteworthy.

280
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,680
Hey, Zoro, wait!

281
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,020
Don't be reckless!

282
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,320
You're completely worn out, aren't you?!

283
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,890
When it rains, it pours; disasters hit one after another.

284
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,300
It's not like anything will change if we complain.

285
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,570
If I die here, it means this is as far as I could go!

286
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,790
Two Sword Style...

287
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,200
Draw and Resheath Technique!

288
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,530
Castle Gate!

289
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,560
What the hell was that?!

290
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,640
Look! It didn't even touch him and he's already hurting!

291
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,410
What is his ability?!

292
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,310
What's that mark he left in the rubble?!

293
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,320
Look! His palm!

294
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,020
A p-paw?!

295
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,370
How can a human have paws?

296
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,280
36 Pound Cannon!

297
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,660
Look out!

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,410
He deflected Zoro's attack with his hand!

299
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,050
How can he do that?!

300
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,990
So that's your ability.

301
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,560
The power to deflect anything.

302
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,560
I'm a paw-man with the power of the Paw Fruit.

303
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,730
A-A paw-man?!

304
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,040
That sounds so harmless.

305
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,440
Are there more lamely named fruits out there?

306
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,770
I dunno whether he's a Warlord or a charitable guy, but...

307
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,630
We're probably overestimating this guy.

308
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,560
Franky!

309
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,190
Franky!

310
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,660
Cyborg Franky.

311
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,400
Is that all you have to offer?

312
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,700
He might be deflecting the air...

313
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,210
Mere artillery is useless against Franky.

314
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,140
It's called Pad Cannon.

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,050
The air deflected at the speed of light generates a powerful shock wave that can pierce through anything.

316
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,730
Your time's up.

317
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,840
Swift Pad Cannon!

318
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,340
Streaming Wolf Blades!

319
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,120
Zoro!

320
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,690
He repelled even that attack!

321
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,130
You!

322
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,180
It’s useless!

323
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,060
He can't keep this up!

324
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,600
It's a miracle that he can even fight in that condition!

325
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,890
He took enough damage to kill a normal human just from that monster Oars!

326
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,340
Zoro, behind you!

327
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,580
Run!

328
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
Zoro!

329
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,300
That's as far as you go!

330
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,810
{\an8}Grind

331
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,810
Concasse!

332
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,590
Sanji!

333
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,900
Try deflecting that with your paws!

334
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,030
Your skull must've been smashed to bits, bastard!

335
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,900
Bastard, mind your own...

336
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,050
Black Leg Sanji.

337
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,790
So that's you.

338
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,490
He didn't even falter from Sanji's kick.

339
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,590
What's going on?

340
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,470
What's with his toughness?!

341
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,570
Is his face made of steel?!

342
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,030
F-F-Fire Bird Star!

343
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,310
King of the Snipers.

344
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,550
What an outrageous alias.

345
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:07,200
I have no interest in destroying you all when you are in such a worn-out state.

346
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,280
My mission is to exterminate every single one of you, but...

347
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,770
What is he doing?

348
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,360
The air...

349
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,520
Is he compressing the air with his paws?

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,790
It's getting smaller.

351
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:36,210
By deflecting the atmosphere with his paws he's pressurizing lots of air, condensing it more and more.

352
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,630
The power of that much condensed air, trying to return to its former size...

353
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,620
Will without a doubt generate a massive shock wave.

354
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,800
Just like a bomb.

355
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,040
W-What?

356
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
A bomb?!

357
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,250
You mean he's creating a bomb?!

358
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,230
I will spare your lives.

359
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,170
But in exchange,

360
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,840
I want you to bring me Straw Hat Luffy's head.

361
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,040
As long as they have him, the government won't mind.

362
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,750
Betray our comrade...?!

363
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,600
Now, bring him to me.

364
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,530
We refuse!

365
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,830
Such a shame.

366
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,290
Ursus Shock.

367
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,580
Lion's Song!

368
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,100
What the hell are you?!

369
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,340
A cyborg, just like Franky?!

370
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,530
No. His body is even harder than steel!

371
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,860
He melted the steel...

372
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,980
Cyborg.

373
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,670
That's certainly true.

374
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,610
But I'm completely different from Cyborg Franky.

375
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,040
I'm what is called a Pacifista.

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,450
A human weapon from the government that is yet to be completed.

377
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,790
Pacifista?

378
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,140
I was developed by the government's genius scientist.

379
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,190
Dr. Vegapunk.

380
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,510
He is the most brilliant person in the world.

381
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:40,270
It is said his knowledge is 500 years ahead of our time.

382
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:48,410
So he possesses such a body, and he's a Devil's Fruit user!

383
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,400
I can't hope to beat that.

384
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,920
And as expected, I can no longer move.

385
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,790
Is there anything I can do to stop you from taking Luffy's head?

386
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,000
That's as far as I can negotiate.

387
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,450
I understand.

388
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,870
Then, go ahead and take it...

389
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,800
But...

390
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,810
Not his head!

391
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,980
I beg you to take my life instead of his!

392
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,990
I may not be as worthy as him yet, but...

393
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,740
The head of the man who would one day become the strongest swordsman...

394
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,660
Isn't bad either!

395
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,440
Even with such an ambition, you'd sacrifice yourself for this man?

396
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,980
The way I see it, this is the only way to help the crew.

397
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,590
How can I protect my ambition when I can't even protect my captain!

398
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,050
Luffy's the man who is gonna be the Pirate King!

399
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,960
Hold it, hold it, you bastard!

400
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,020
What'll happen if you die?

401
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,660
What about your ambition, idiot?

402
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,860
Hey, big guy!

403
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,750
Hey!

404
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,490
Forget this moss-head swordsman.

405
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,780
Take my life instead!

406
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,780
The Marines are still taking me lightly, but...

407
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,260
Before long, the one who's bound to become the most dangerous person in this crew is...

408
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,050
Me, Black-Leg Sanji!

409
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,660
What're you waiting for?

410
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,490
I'm prepared to exchange my life for his!

411
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,450
The flower of my glorious death shall bloom on this spot.

412
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,470
Hey, make sure to...

413
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,610
Say goodbye to everyone for me.

414
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,500
Tell them I'm sorry, but they'll have to look for a new cook.

415
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,630
W-Why you!

416
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,170
That's my last request.

417
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,960
If I were to claim Straw Hat's life after this, I'd feel ashamed.

418
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,690
I'm in your debt.

419
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,130
Trust me in what I'm about to do,

420
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,820
I'll keep my promise no matter what.

421
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,440
But in exchange, I will make you...

422
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,840
Experience hell itself.

423
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,960
What I just extracted from his body is his pain and fatigue.

424
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,790
All the damage he accumulated during his battle with Moriah is within this.

425
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:34,870
If you really intend to take his place, then you must literally share his suffering.

426
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,090
Adding such damage to your current condition will eliminate your chances of survival.

427
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,160
It will be certain death.

428
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,380
Have a taste.

429
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,200
How was it?

430
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,080
Please let me... do this somewhere else!

431
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,430
He has good friends.

432
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,680
As expected from your son,

433
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,380
Dragon.

434
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,850
Hey! Is everyone alright?!

435
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,440
He was so sure that attack would be enough to exterminate us all that he didn't even check if it did!

436
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,510
Take that, stupid bear-man!

437
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,590
That hurts.

438
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,700
Hey, hey, are you kidding me?

439
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,750
What happened to you?

440
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,960
Hey look, my body is as light as a feather!

441
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,690
I dunno why!

442
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,840
Liar, that's not possible!

443
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,830
Maybe he took so much damage that now he feels fine.

444
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,390
It's not as simple as that!

445
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,540
Where did that idiot go?!

446
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,410
There he is.

447
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,390
You sure scared me for a second.

448
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,460
Hey, where did that Warlord-

449
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,200
What's with all this blood!?

450
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,370
Hey!

451
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,890
Hey, are you alive?!

452
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,860
Where is he?!

453
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,340
What the hell happened here?!

454
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,440
No-

455
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,830
Nothing...

456
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,830
at all!
