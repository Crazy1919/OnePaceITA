raising our battle cry.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,210
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,350

That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,140

Fill your empty heart with dreams.

Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,670
you will move on.

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,560

I mean, sailors!

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,160
We were traveling and lost our way!

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,460
Please let us in!

43
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,630
Is anyone home?

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,390
That's weird, the inside looks like a tunnel.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,550
I can see a courtyard on the other side.

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,630
Sorry to intrude!

47
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,750
You think he's out?

48
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,340
That wouldn't be good.

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,930
If we go back, the zombies'll get us.

50
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
Look, a light just went on!

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,250
Actually, it's more of a spotlight.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,500
It's shining on this well...

53
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,090
Welcome.

54
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,570
One, two, three.

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,240
W-What?

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,390
Four, five.

57
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,690
O-Ow!

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,250
She's attacking us with plates!

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,350
Six, seven.

60
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,170
Ow, are you only aiming at me?!

61
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,050
Yes, that's right.

62
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,510
You aren't allowed in the mansion.

63
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,440
You two over there can come in.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,510
Eh? Why?

65
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,430
You aren't going anywhere!

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,470
Eight, nine!

67
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,830
Why?

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,790
Stop, that's enough!

69
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,690
What?

70
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,190
No more scary stuff, please!

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,660
Someone else is there?

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,280
Can't you make just one exception, Cindry-chan?

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,870
I'm sorry for scaring you like that.

74
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,490
Long ago, in order to test the love of her rich fiancÃ©,

75
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,060
This woman broke all of his expensive china plates,

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,860
and was chased off and led a horrible life.

77
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,760
My plate-hating servant, Cindry-chan.

78
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay... whatever.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And I still haven't introduced myself...

80
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:34,690
Master of the Mansion (Genius Surgeon)
Doctor Hogback

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,780
I am the world-renowned Doctor Hogback!

82
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,680
And I'm a genius.

83
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,620
Ten!

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,540
Usopp!

85
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,200
W-Wait, Cindry-chan!

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,850
I told you to stop that!

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,010
You're supposed to listen to what I have to say!

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,540
I wish plates would disappear from this world.

89
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,510
I understand!

90
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,350
I really do understand, but right now I'm trying to talk!

91
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,170
Chopper...

92
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,630
That's the guy you wanted to...

93
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,860
D-Doctor Hogback, it's really him!

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,660
He looks kinda idiotic.

95
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,320
Stop it, Nami!

96
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,590
Well, we can continue this inside.

97
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,890
We can make an exception and allow all three of you in.

98
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,320
So, welcome.

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,020
T-That's right, come in.

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,940
I don't understand why I couldn't go in...

101
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,650
But anyway, let's go.

102
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,490
Yeah, it's at least better than the zombies.

103
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,120
Hey, I'm still...!

104
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,110
I'm... still here...

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,230
I'd like to welcome you to my mansion!

106
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,820
You guys are so dirty!

107
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,490
Why are you here?

108
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,590
Well, a lot of reasons...

109
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,450
Firstly...

110
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,560
I wanna talk to you later!

111
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,360
We were attacked by zombies in the graveyard, and we ran here! {Maybe like this: "We were attacked by zombies in the graveyard and ran here!"}

112
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,770
Zombies?

113
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,710
We've seen loads of other unbelievable creatures here too!

114
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,020
What's up with this place?

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,280
You live here, you should know!

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,720
Oh, you were attacked?

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,890
I'm glad you made it here safely.

118
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,210
That's great.

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,930
As for your question, here's my answer:

120
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,420
I live here because I don't know what those things are.

121
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,840
So, you're here to research the zombies, Doctor?!

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,300
Of course!

123
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,350
Humans have a horrible fear of zombies.

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,480
But if we look at it as people coming back from the dead instead...

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,440
Then isn't it the immortality all humans strive for?

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,160
Everyone has one or two deceased people close to them that they wish to see again...

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,810
With medical science, we are capable of controlling whether people live or die, fearless of the gods!

128
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,540
It was for that reason I went exile to begin my research on this mysterious island.

129
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,440
R-Really?

130
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,200
But if you succeed, there'll be tons of people that'll be happy!

131
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,850
I'll cheer you on, Doctor Hogback!

132
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,600
Oh, thank you, Doctor Chopper.

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,570
E-Even if you call me a doctor, I'm not happy, asshole!

134
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,180
Can I have your autograph?

135
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,730
Oh, sure.

136
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,990
To Doctor Chopper-kun,

137
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,930
And later, can I see your lab?

138
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,400
Don't you ever even look at my lab...!

139
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,490
Oh, Cindry-chan, can't you at least put the pudding on a plate?

140
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,100
Or is it hopeless to ask?!

141
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,600
I wish for all plates to be gone.

142
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,820
Well, don't worry, we keep the tablecloth clean just for occasions like this!

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,820
Then, let's eat!

144
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,240
You could at least use a spoon!

145
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,660
Oh! It's really sweet and good!

146
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,430
I have prepared the bath.

147
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,020
You're all dirty, so you can use it.

148
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,910
Oh yeah, old man!

149
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,030
This is all fine, but...

150
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,420
You didn't happen to see a weird skeleton pass by, did you?

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,930
A-A skeleton?

152
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,030
Yeah.

153
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,980
He's got an afro, he's real tall...

154
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,910
He's really light...

155
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,190
Well, I guess it's weird enough being a walking, talking skeleton.

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,360
Do you know anything about it?

157
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,160
No, I don't.

158
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,910
Really?

159
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh well.

160
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,650
Do they mean that guy?

161
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,820
No... it can't be...

162
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
Mansion's Bath

163
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,500
I don't really have any interest in seeing human women naked...

164
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,680
But I do wanna sneak a peek at Doctor Hogback's lab.

165
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,430
But really, Nami,

166
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,220
why do we have to keep watch for you like this?

167
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,310
If you're that scared, you could've skipped the bath!

168
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,670
You know, for being grabbed by zombies like that, you two sure don't seem to care.

169
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,620
You're filthy!

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,780
We're just gonna get dirty again!

171
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,810
Yeah!

172
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,610
Tonight, we're leaving.

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,260
What are you, stupi-

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,880
They told us we could spend the night.

175
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,880
Do you know what could happen to us if we went out tonight?!

176
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,520
Anyway, we're not gonna go anywhere else.

177
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,770
Luffy and the others are gonna come and save us.

178
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,410
Okay?

179
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,770
I agree!

180
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,850
I don't wanna go back out there!

181
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,390
I don't like that forest, nor the graves! {The line is too long for the sub, but how about "I don't like neither the forest, nor the graves!". Also, I believe Chopper is saying something like "Neither the forest nor the graves!", so we could use that too as continuation of the previous line.}

182
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,940
The inside is the same as the outside.

183
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,310
Have you taken a good look around?

184
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,900
If I'm not mistaken,

185
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,360
The halls and rooms are full.

186
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,590
This mansion is filled with zombies.

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,470
W-Where are they?!

188
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,600
But the most suspicious of all is Hogback himself.

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,630
He's definitely lying.

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,460
If he really didn't have any connection to the zombies like he says,

191
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,970
why would he be living in a mansion filled with them?

192
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,900
W-What about you, Chopper?

193
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,510
If that's really true, then...

194
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,770
No...

195
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,750
So for now, we'll just pretend we don't know,

196
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,980
And we'll leave tonight.

197
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,270
Well, well, what a tricky girl.

198
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,820
What?

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,700
Usopp, Chopper, did one of you say something?

200
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,480
I didn't say anything.

201
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,280
Hey, I just farted!

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,650
Ew, gross, Usopp!

203
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,540
I'm Usopoo!

204
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,230
You damn...!

205
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,950
What's happening?

206
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,140
There's nobody here...!

207
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
Compared to that woman on the ship...

208
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,630
You're a lot weaker - more my type.

209
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,020
There's someone here...!

210
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,260
Usopp, Cho-

211
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,200
You... are going to be my bride.

212
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,060
Hey Nami, what happened?

213
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,630
Can you smell Usopp's fart in here too?

214
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,900
Thank you very much!

215
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,920
You're thanking her?

216
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,840
Get out...

217
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,710
Stupid, help me...!

218
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,920
Damn you...!

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,550
Usopp, Chopper, help!

220
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,600
There's someone here!

221
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,940
She's right, I can smell it!

222
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,960
Still?

223
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,500
Sorry!

224
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,960
Not the fart, a person!

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,690
He's going out the window!

226
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,330
How is the window doing that on its own?

227
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,990
What's getting away?

228
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,960
Deadly Gunpowder Star!

229
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,070
I wonder if he got away...

230
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,330
He heard our whole conversation...

231
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,120
H-Hey, Nami, what just happened?

232
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,420
I don't get it!

233
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,630
He was here the whole time...

234
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,640
An invisible man.

235
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,170
It's no good.

236
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,870
Meanwhile... in the Thousand Sunny
Luffy and the Others

237
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,330
No matter what we do, we can't get out.

238
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,100
From this huge spiderweb...

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,560
That skeleton's ship is stuck too, just like the Sunny.

240
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,570
And the Mini Merry Usopp and the others were riding is stuck here too.

241
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:27,930
With the front gate like that, it's almost like it's calling to you.

242
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,620
Damn.

243
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,350
I can almost see all the little ghosts beckoning us in.

244
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,940
What're you going on about over there, Zoro?

245
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,090
You need to come too!

246
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,310
If you stay here you'll just be bored.

247
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,740
Let's go!

248
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,810
You can even share some of my bento! {Zoro share Luffy's bento with Luffy? -_-} {Also, it should probably be "You can even share some of my bento!", with the respective changes}

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,770
Why are there stairs all of a sudden?

250
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,730
It's 'cause this is the entrance!

251
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,690
Hey, it's full of skeletons.

252
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,760
Oh, Cerberus?

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,020
Hell would probably be safer than this place.

254
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,730
Oh, it's cute.

255
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,730
You think it can fight?

256
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,230
Dunno.

257
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,650
You think it tastes good?

258
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,720
It wants a fight now.

259
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,180
So I'll just...

260
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,550
No, hold on.

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
I'm gonna try taming it.

262
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,300
Idiot, I know it's a dog, but come on.

263
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,560
It looks more like a boss or something.

264
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,910
Dog like dog.

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,120
There there...

266
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Paw!

267
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,830
Right after we warned him...

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,290
There there, good boy...

269
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,120
There there...

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,390
That's it, let go nice and easy...

271
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,780
That's a good boy...

272
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,140
Bastard!

273
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,410
Down.

274
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,080
That's just wrong.

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,250
But ignoring that, it has horrible scarring on it.

276
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,980
It simply remaining alive is a mystery in itself.

277
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,410
It looks like a fox got mixed into it, so I doubt it's really a normal animal.

278
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,410
Man, fun things are just showing up as soon as we get here, it's great!

279
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,920
Cerberus-san doesn't seem too happy.

280
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,090
Having it do something like this after losing is really damaging its pride.

281
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,760
Nami-san!

282
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,180
Hey!

283
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Where are you, Nami-swan!?

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,080
Nami-san!

285
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,060
We left the tunnel, and now we're in a forest?

286
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,250
Nami-san!

287
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,270
This is weird.

288
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,690
Huh?

289
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,020
An old man tree...

290
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,420
and a unicorn...

291
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,910
are drinking together...!

292
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,140
Help!

293
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,850
Gotcha!

294
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,670
Please let me go!

295
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,850
Hey you guys, come be pirates with-

296
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,420
Stop that!

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,420
Doctor Hogback's Mansion

298
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,600
That was a close one...

299
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,160
Hey, Absalom.

300
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,500
I know you're here.

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,230
What was that commotion just now?

302
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,830
Were you in the bathing room again?

303
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,940
I was looking for a bride. {you need to readd him saying hogback's name}{}{}{}

304
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,620
I like that woman.

305
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,960
I'll make her mine.

306
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,040
Well, you're not getting any of the bounty money.

307
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,380
What's that?

308
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,430
This time, six of them have bounties.

309
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,380
One of them is over 100 million,

310
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,510
and the captain himself is 300 million!

311
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,060
300 million?

312
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,940
Are you sure, Perona?

313
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,940
The government doesn't put a bounty like that on an ordinary pirate.

314
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,110
And now that we know that, we'll put all of our power into capturing them, Absalom.

315
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,570
Tonight we have our work cut out for us!

316
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,710
There's no such thing as an invisible man!

317
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,660
Inside the Mansion
Second Floor Hallway

318
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,660
There was one!

319
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,000
Didn't you see him attacking me?!

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
Uh, well...

321
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,950
No, I didn't!

322
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,810
Yes you did!

323
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,830
You're tricking me!

324
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,130
You just want me to tell you I saw you naked so you can charge me!

325
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,800
I was gonna die!

326
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,390
Although I'm still gonna charge you.

327
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,170
Anyway, I don't believe anything we've seen on this island!

328
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,950
Listen!

329
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,140
The invisible man? Your imagination.

330
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,920
The ghosts? Weird birds.

331
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,600
The zombies are a race of...
mysterious underground dwellers!

332
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,530
What are you talking about?

333
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,610
It's true we saw a skeleton brought back to life with a devil fruit.

334
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,280
But!

335
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,700
That was just an exception to the rule!

336
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,520
No two people can have the same devil fruit ability,

337
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,980
And there's no other way people can be brought back to life!

338
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,340
Right, Chopper?

339
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,050
There's no other way something like that can happen!

340
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:16,750
Even with medicine, there isn't any way something like that should be possible.

341
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,770
But...

342
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,230
Doctor Hogback is really amazing, and he's researching it.

343
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,040
It's possible even something as miraculous as that is going on here!

344
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,330
Don't you trust him a little too much?

345
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,500
Doctor Hogback is a great man!

346
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,950
I respect him a lot!

347
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,000
You're the one in the wrong!

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,830
You're saying the doctor and the zombies are together without any proof!

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,330
I can't shake off the feeling we're being watched...

350
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,080
It's weird.

351
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,260
Oh well...

352
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,550
That's the room from before, right?

353
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,540
Yeah...

354
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,850
Why is it so dark?

355
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,440
What?

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,210
C-Cindry-chan?

357
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,160
Doctor!

358
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Where'd you go?

359
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,140
Thank you for the bath...

360
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,270
The two of them have retired for the night.

361
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,860
Hildon?!

362
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,170
Why you...

363
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,100
You just left us out in that graveyard earlier!

364
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,190
I had no choice.

365
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,470
I took the horses to go do something, and when I wasn't looking...

366
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,650
You're lying!

367
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,310
All of you on this island are ghouls!

368
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,540
T-That's insulting.

369
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,080
Now if you'll follow me, I'll show you your rooms...

370
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,590
You're just ignoring all that, and showing us around?!

371
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,040
I wonder if that's really the door to hell?

372
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,590
We're just gonna leave now, sorry.

373
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,690
Please let me talk to the doctor again first!

374
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,810
They found us out, Hildon...

375
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,850
Please ignore that, and I'll show you your rooms...

376
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,770
It's alright.

377
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,490
They've already started to figure it all out...

378
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,320
So before they get away...

379
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,530
Why is...

380
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,200
that painting...

381
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,620
talk- talk- talk-

382
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,050
You're cute when you're shaking in fear!

383
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,490
Chopper!

384
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,030
A zombie came out of the picture?!

385
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,720
Save me!

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,890
Chopper!

387
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,720
The leader of the zombies in this room is I, Buhichuck-sama!

388
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,980
Don't think you'll be able to take even one step out of this room, oink!

389
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,150
T-That mounted head just talked?

390
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,280
Ow, ow, ow...

391
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,570
Who just stabbed that sword in my back?

392
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,510
It's just like Nami said!

393
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,510
This mansion really is filled with zombies!

394
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,680
Usopp!

395
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
Why you...

396
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Take this, you stupid rug-bear!

397
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,740
No, it's a candle!

398
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,530
Hot, hot!

399
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,570
Get it away, I'll burn!

400
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,690
It's fire, I'm scared!

401
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,070
Put it out!

402
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,910
He's on the chandelier!

403
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,910
Knock him down, fast!

404
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,560
I know your weakness!

405
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,960
Take this, all of you!

406
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
Take that!

407
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,660
and that!

408
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,140
and that!

409
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,290
Chopper, Nami, get to the door!

410
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,830
We're getting out of here!

411
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,770
Okay!

412
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,700
Let's get out!

413
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,710
I've had enough!

414
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,950
Hurry and get it open!

415
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,320
There're lots of them here too!

416
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,070
What are you doing, Nami?!

417
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,200
No...!

418
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,350
D-Don't tell me...

419
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,620
It won't open!

420
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,040
We're trapped!

421
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,670
You've really done it now.

422
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,710
You won't get away from us!

423
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,710
Damn pirates!

424
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,390
Get down!

425
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,230
That was close!

426
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,950
Anyway, let's get out of here!

427
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,040
We'll go to a different room!

428
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,400
We won't let you get away!

429
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,950
No, no, no!

430
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,660
Stop!

431
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,190
We're in the fireplace!

432
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,350
There's nowhere else to run!

433
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,890
Where are we?

434
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,130
Hey, they disappeared!

435
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,680
They disappeared into the fireplace!

436
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,110
Crap, they opened the secret passage!

437
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,020
They'll be in Hogback-sama's laboratory!

438
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,650
Follow them!

439
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,860
It's no good, it's blocked from the other side!

440
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,710
No matter where they go in this mansion, the other Surprise Zombies are there, oink!

441
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,820
We need to get out of this tunnel, and stay out of rooms with paintings!

442
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,630
Where's a room?

443
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,530
Over there!

444
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,340
More paintings!

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,310
No, photos?

446
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,670
Good...

447
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,910
They aren't zombies.

448
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,750
Isn't this... that girl?

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,330
The plate-hating one, Cindry-chan?

450
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,420
What is this place?

451
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,380
Now that I look at her again, she's really pretty...

452
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,300
That servant Cindry-chan...

453
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,970
So... is this her room?

454
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,140
Come on, would you really put this many pictures of yourself in your own room?

455
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,260
But she had stitches all over her face and body!

456
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,040
Yeah... these pictures don't show any at all.

457
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,030
It can't really be a different person...

458
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,250
Maybe they're really old?

459
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,340
Victoria Cindry.

460
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,340
It looks like she was a really famous actress.

461
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,190
Look, all of these articles are about her.

462
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,040
An actress?

463
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,510
Didn't they say something earlier about her not being a servant?

464
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,400
Something about breaking plates and being thrown out by her husband...

465
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Looking at this, I just don't think something like that happened.

466
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,260
She was born into a rich family...

467
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,810
She was very popular ever since she was a child...

468
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,700
What is it?

469
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,580
Ten years ago...

470
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,420
She fell from the stage...

471
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,290
and died!

472
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,820
W-W-What the hell are you talking about?!

473
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,140
She's alive, isn't she?!

474
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,970
She's not dead, right?!

475
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,970
But if that report really is true,

476
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,290
that means she already died once and came back to life!

477
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,490
On this island... those were all real zombies...

478
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,760
What we saw... really were living dead!

479
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
No way...

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,090
This is just getting even creepier!

481
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,620
I wish I hadn't known tha-

482
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,090
What?!

483
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,480
Wait, Usopp!

484
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,250
Isn't that a treasure chest~?

485
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,690
That was a fast change!

486
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,370
Hey, Usopp, open it!

487
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,320
Please open it up for me?

488
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,120
Sorry, this isn't where we keep the treasure!

489
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,100
Jack-in-the-box!

490
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,000
Stay out!

491
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,590
Painting zombies!

492
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,150
"This isn't where we keep the treasure."

493
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,970
That's what that jack-in-the-box zombie said.

494
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,730
Oh, it's the guard.

495
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,020
It seems as if there are people lost in this mansion.

496
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,690
Oh, it's you?

497
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,110
That isn't a problem...

498
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,820
I will subdue them.

499
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,550
You need to stop trying to make everything your friend!

500
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,340
Our crew already has weird shit like a raccoon dog and a robot!

501
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,360
Hey, I'm not a robot!

502
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,300
I'm a cyborg, bastard!

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,310
What matters is that you aren't human!

504
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,850
But my base was human!

505
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,900
No, your base was a pervert!

506
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,590
Oh, well, if you say it that way...

507
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,030
It wasn't a compliment...

508
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,750
I wonder what we'll find next?

509
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,620
This is so much fun!

510
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,580
About that tree person and that unicorn...

511
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,290
What is it?

512
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,500
All of the strange animals we've seen in this forest have similar characteristics...

513
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,540
Bandages.

514
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,410
Stitches.

515
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,440
And a number tattooed onto them.

516
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,180
A number...

517
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,190
I guess it does have one.

518
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,720
So you mean someone's doing this to them?

519
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,230
Yes, most likely.

520
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,650
Hm? What's that sound?

521
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,030
There, it's a ghost!

522
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,280
They're all dancing and wiggling!

523
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,520
Cool!

524
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,420
They sound kinda freaky.

525
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,990
I'll catch one for a pet!

526
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,540
So they can phase through things...

527
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,720
Alright!

528
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,620
Fresh Fire!

529
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,080
No, that didn't work either.

530
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,750
I'm worthless.

531
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,090
This week's me is just completely worthless. {Should it really remain "This week's me", instead of "This week I'm"?}

532
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,120
No matter what I do, I fail.

533
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,360
I don't have the will to live...

534
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,200
I can hear the whole world booing at me...

535
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,950
Why are you getting so depressed?!

536
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,940
Alright!

537
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,290
Bastard!

538
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,610
If I were to be reborn,

539
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,690
I want to be a shellfish.

540
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,010
I'm the worst ever...

541
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,240
I wish there was a hole I could be buried in...

542
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,260
Really, what the hell are you guys doing?!

543
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,590
Perhaps if you're touched by the ghosts, then you have feelings of worthlessness?

544
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,070
That doesn't make sense!

545
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,380
They're pathetic.

546
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,080
They never try their hardest anyway,

547
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,500
So these ghosts are able to play games with their hearts.

548
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm sorry I was ever born...

549
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,920
Enough of that!

550
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,900
It seems it's just like Robin-chan said.

551
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,090
Even without physical body, they're still able to cause such emotional distress with a simple touch.

552
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,570
If they are our enemies, they're very strong.

553
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,640
Definitely.

554
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,270
This really is a mysterious island.

555
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,260
Oh, next time I see those ghosts, I'm not holding back!

556
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,710
And I won't get one as a pet, I don't want it!

557
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,830
They've gotta have a weakness!

558
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,370
This time, I'll get rid of 'em!

559
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,860
Damn, that was just too funny!

560
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,670
Shut up!

561
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,550
The patchwork animals with numbers may very well be created...

562
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,550
But those ghosts seem to be something entirely different.

563
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,030
Those guys were on the boat too.

564
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,140
I get the feeling they're showing up every once in a while just to spy on us...

565
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,060
So the question is, who's behind all of this?

566
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,450
Wow, what a huge graveyard!

567
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,500
This place is really cool!

568
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,850
Hey, let's eat our bento here!

569
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,590
Idiot, if you eat it here, the food will taste nasty!

570
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
There, there, there...

571
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,560
Why the hell would I wanna go back?!

572
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,940
Is it a badly injured old guy?

573
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,200
It's a zombie, obviously!

574
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,160
Underestimating us zombies...

575
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,900
is something you shouldn't do!

576
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,970
Are zombies really this lively?

577
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,240
We'll show you how dangerous zombies really are!

578
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,840
Oh, you wanna fight?

579
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,560
Then we'll show you just how dangerous we are.

580
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,600
600 Million Belly Jackpot!

581
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,240
What are you guys doing here?

582
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,250
Um, zombie stuff... being buried.

583
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,160
Rotting...

584
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,810
Yeah, rotting.

585
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,340
Yeah, me too.

586
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,840
Are you messing with me?

587
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,800
No, no! We're not! We're sorry!

588
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Have a man with a long nose...

589
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,210
a woman with orange hair...

590
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,060
and a reindeer-like raccoon dog passed through here?

591
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,440
Ah, yes, yes, yes...

592
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,940
But we won't tell you!

593
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,940
We have orders not to give anyone information like that.

594
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Orders! Orders! Orders! Orders!

595
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,120
Oh? So you absolutely won't tell us?

596
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,120
Orders! Orders! Orders! Orders!

597
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
Those three came through.

598
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,640
They're my friends.

599
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,750
You didn't touch them, right?

600
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,880
Eh...?!

601
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,840
T-They were your friends?

602
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
I-I didn't!

603
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,510
Neither did I!

604
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,180
Tell me the truth!

605
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,260
He touched them!

606
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,510
Eh?! Don't sell out a friend!

607
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,220
You're the one that tried to bite them!

608
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,580
We all attacked together.

609
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,400
Idiot! Don't say that!

610
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,390
It looks like they headed towards that mansion.

611
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,060
Glad they're okay.

612
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,750
Though we still don't know about Brook...

613
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,210
But that's alright, isn't it?

614
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,330
W-Wait a minute!

615
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,520
I saw you just now.

616
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,640
You're terribly strong, right?

617
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,740
Would you listen to my story for a moment?

618
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,630
You're badly wounded. What happened?!

619
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,060
We told you, he's a zombie!

620
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,810
No, I'm a badly wounded old man.

621
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:23,070
You're too easy to confuse! We'll just call you a zombie!

622
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,450
There's a man I want you to beat.

623
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,100
I know you guys can do it!

624
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,230
There are so many victims... if he was defeated they would all be saved.

625
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,770
I would be so grateful if I got my shadow back.

626
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,710
It's true! You're missing your shadow too, old man? {Can reorder the sentence to "Old man, you're missing your shadow too?"}

627
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,980
Just like Brook!

628
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,130
Who did this?

629
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,430
Is it someone on this island?

630
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,890
Moriah...

631
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,040
A man known as Moriah.

632
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,140
He's really frightening!

633
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,050
Moriah?

634
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,480
Could you be referring to...

635
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,890
Gekko Moriah?

636
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,000
That's it, that Moriah!

637
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
Robin, you know him?

638
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,570
I know his name very well.

639
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,330
He's a man whose former bounty exceeds even yours, Luffy...!

640
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,570
Gekko Moriah is...

641
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,500
one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!
