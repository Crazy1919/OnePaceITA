00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,470
Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,880
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,220
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

Vegapunk Fansubs

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,900
along the boundary between sky and sea.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,130
Now we're rowing our way

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,660

Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,220
raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,970
ring out.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,040
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,510
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,100
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,400
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,810
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,450
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,660
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,000
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,670
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

{\an5}General Zombie Night!
Thriller Bark's Mysterious Four

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,440
A Warlord of the Sea?

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,150
Is that true, Robin?!

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,450
Yes, Gekko Moriah is a man of many mysteries.

41
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,010
What's a guy like that doing way out here?

42
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,010
I'm not sure.

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,300
But there are other victims who have become lost in the forest like me.

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,540
There are others?

45
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,830
Yes...

46
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,220
The fact that you were all invited here as well... It's likely that Moriah has his eyes on you!

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,510
We creep about in this dark forest so we aren't caught by the zombies...

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,770
Too scared to run to sea and expose ourselves under the sun!

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,400
This old body doesn't even have the will to live anymore...

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,450
Before I die... just once...

51
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,380
Just once!

52
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,500
I'd like to walk under the open sun!

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,020
Is that true?! That's so horrible!

54
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,310
Alright! I'll help you! Don't worry at all!

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,260
You idiot, I'm not crying!

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,700
You're too compassionate! Don't get weighed down with this...

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,690
Seriously.

58
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,950
Hey, old fart!

59
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,160
It's a lady's privilege to cry for sympathy!

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,830
Stop getting carried away!

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,140
Well, still...

62
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,960
We were already looking for the shadow stealing guy, so...

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:23,180
If he's after us too, we'd kick his ass anyways, so why not save you along the way, old man?

64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,050
Right?

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,730
Thank you for saying something like that! It's just a little, but somehow I can feel hope again!

66
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,750
We're counting on you!

67
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,560
Go for it!

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Beat that Moriah guy!

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,900
You were listening in? You other victims!

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,860
Yeah...

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,910
Sorry, I got carried away crying too!

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,200
Meanwhile... at Hogback's Mansion
Usopp's Team

73
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,250
That's Hogback's laugh!

74
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
What is this room?

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,260
It's a lab!

76
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,090
It's almost complete!

77
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,380
My magnificent marionette!

78
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,340
Look, Cindry-chan!

79
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,150
This is art; the work of a genius!

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,090
I hope it fails when it's almost done.

81
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,340
What are you saying, Cindry-chan?!

82
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,570
You really don't hold back what you're feeling!

83
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,580
I made dinner.

84
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,940
Oh yeah, what is it tonight?

85
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,290
Soup spaghetti.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,370
Watch out, the soup is falling off, Cindry-chan!

87
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,390
I wish that plates were extinct.

88
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,280
I know that!

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,850
But why do you pick foods that need them?!

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,480
There's lots of other things you can make!

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,840
Cindry-chan's there too...

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,510
Yakisoba for example, or... yakiudon or...

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,510
{\an8}Fried noodles

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,030
Okay?

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,220
Maybe katsudon or...

96
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,220
{\an8}Breaded pork on rice

97
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,450
Is she really the same girl who died in that accident?

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,820
I can't believe it...

99
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,910
No more soups or anything!

100
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,700
And this soup spaghetti?

101
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,760
What's that on the table?

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,540
It looks like it's a corpse...

103
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,010
Being in that colour, there's no way it's alive.

104
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,660
It's got a number on it just like the zombies in the graveyard!

105
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,980
He said it's almost complete...

106
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,020
So this confirms it.

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,390
That's a zombie he's in the process of reanimating!

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,140
All of the zombies here on the island were brought back to life by Hogback.

109
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,640
That's the only explanation at the moment!

110
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,980
But with medicine you only save people before they die!

111
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,180
No matter how carefully you fix a dead person's body,

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,510
you can't bring it back to life!

113
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,330
I don't get it either...

114
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,220
But maybe if we stay here and watch, we can figure out his secret.

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,940
How do you do?

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,900
If you wish to look inside, it would be so much better for you to simply enter!

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,360
"Yohoho"?!

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
B-Brook?

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
Who is it?!

120
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,210
You! Why are you here?!

121
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,060
What?! "Yohoho"?
Wasn't that Brook just now?!

122
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,580
But he wasn't a skeleton!

123
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,970
He had flesh and skin.

124
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,850
You guys!

125
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,270
They found us!

126
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,150
What did you all see...

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,730
I told you never to peek into the laboratory...

128
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,650
W-We didn't see anything!

129
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,660
I didn't see anything either!

130
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,070
I didn't either!

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,950
Really?

132
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,040
I-It's true!

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,560
Definitely not the zombie you're making!

134
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't say that!

135
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,340
Well, fine then...

136
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,260
No matter what secrets you may have found so far, it's already too late...

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
In just a few minutes...

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,770
The night attack will begin.

139
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,500
Night attack?

140
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,240
The other guests lost on this island will have their guard down... the night attack begins... {maybe move this line to graveyard}

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,830
To get buried again just before the night attack...

142
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,380
Itching, burning, pain. It's all in your head!

143
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,280
You're all dead already!

144
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,200
Now, wake up! Soldier Zombies!

145
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,790
Beaten and beaten, you will stand again and again!

146
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,440
That is the true terror of you zombies!

147
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,380
What a bother...

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,280
Hey! Stop being so lazy!

149
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,770
Stop goofing around, zombies!

150
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,810
Tell me who I am.

151
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,790
Our leader!

152
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,170
Our leader Absalom!

153
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,130
Leader! Leader! Leader!

154
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,430
Whose hobby is peeping!

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,650
Pervy-Leader!

156
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,060
Pervsalom! Pervsalom!

157
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,280
Pervy!

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,140
Pervert!

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,350
Shut up!

160
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,850
W-W-Welcome home! Lady Perona... Ladies...!

161
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,750
Shut up, Kumashi! {Gotta change everywhere the name to "Bearsy", or whatever one we're choosing for him.}

162
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,210
What's with that look?! I hate it when you do that! {She doesn't ask, but in English you'd probably put a question mark on the 1st phrase.}

163
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,300
I-I'm sorry.

164
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,670
If you're not cute then you're not fit to serve me!

165
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,250
Hurry! Hurry!

166
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,950
It's starting! It's starting!

167
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,160
It's time for the night attack!

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,500
It's midnight!

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,510
Master!

170
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,130
Moriah-sama!

171
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,600
It's time to get up!

172
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,150
Nin! Do it!

173
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,230
Alright! Wake up!

174
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,640
Master!

175
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,470
I was having a nightmare!

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,020
Isn't that the best, Master?

177
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,670
Since Moriah-sama has been sleeping since the last time we had a night attack four days ago...

178
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,740
We've prepared you four days worth of food!

179
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,920
The prey this time is pretty tough!

180
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,700
It's the group that brought down Enies Lobby last month...

181
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,750
Straw Hat Luffy's crew!

182
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,540
They'll certainly be of use to Moriah-sama!

183
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,270
It's really starting to pour...

184
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,130
Alright, should we just run to the mansion then?

185
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,260
Wait a sec!

186
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,010
I can see some huge thing behind the mansion.

187
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,770
It looks like a mark...

188
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,530
The fog is clearing up a bit...

189
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,320
Huh? A flag?

190
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,630
No.

191
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,350
Isn't that a sail?

192
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,990
A sail?

193
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,950
That's right!

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,660
You were still following us?!

195
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,300
It's just as he said, that's a sail.

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,560
Thriller Bark...

197
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,240
Is not an island, but the largest pirate ship in the world!

198
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,630
You can see that at the back of the mansion is the main mast.

199
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,430
That's where Gekko Moriah is!

200
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,090
Now, Soldier Zombie Unit...

201
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,260
The General Zombies will finish off the pirates!

202
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,770
Soldier Zombie & General Zombie
General

203
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:35,380
{\an8}No matter how many times you go down, just get back up quickly and crush them with fear of the undead!

204
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,750
Absalom of the Graveyard

205
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Wild Zombie & Surprise Zombie
General

206
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,430
Just now, the bell chimed.

207
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,040
Ghost Princess
Perona

208
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,800
Now it's time for us to really go at it.

209
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,940
Don't think you can escape from here, moronic pirates!

210
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,240
Is everything ready?! Zombies!

211
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,600
This is the realm of the undead...

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,940
Thriller Bark!

213
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,890
Be prepared to witness a nightmare!

214
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,140
Well, let's go!

215
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,180
Into the haunted house!

216
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,340
How is this zombie research, Hogback?!

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,850
You were experimenting here!
You've been resurrecting the dead, haven't you!?

218
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,560
H-Hey, Nami, saying it so bluntly...

219
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,650
From here on you're free to think whatever you like!

220
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,760
But what would make you think something like that?

221
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,100
I've seen that woman's obituary.

222
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
Victoria Cindry,

223
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,640
ten years ago, you died!

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,480
You guys! You went into that room?

225
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,020
Cindry-chan!

226
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,470
Samurai Ryuuma...

227
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,300
Cast these fools into a world of shadows, immediately!

228
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,160
W-Wait!

229
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,250
Into that shadow world where you will never see the light again!

230
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,880
The night attack has already begun!

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,940
Well, well! Now that I can see you clearly, you're quite a lovely woman.

232
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,500
Beautiful!

233
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,140
Would you please allow me to see your panties?

234
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,470
As if!

235
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,060
This conversation...!

236
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,240
It's exactly like with him!

237
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,460
The zombies you've seen up until now were on a different level.

238
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,600
He is a general zombie, and his body is special.

239
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,340
This man came from 
Wano Country in the New World.

240
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,240
You may think I'm just exaggerating, but the story of how he cut down a dragon mid-flight is still told.

241
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,450
He's a legendary samurai.

242
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,560
This is bad!

243
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,020
Don't come!

244
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,570
There's no way to escape!

245
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,490
Cindry-san?

246
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,740
Could you please open up the door to that passage over there?

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,430
Also, I would love to have dinner afterwards.

248
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,000
W-What? I thought he was going to cut us...

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,770
That scared me! What was he trying to do?

250
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,730
W-Whatever, it doesn't matter right now! Now's our chance to run, the door is wide open!

251
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,650
Hurry!

252
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,890
Well done.

253
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,340
That's truly a master's swordplay. After humming and walking three blocks...

254
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,520
Only then do they truly realize they've been cut...

255
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,620
Three-Pace Hum:

256
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,630
Notch Slash!

257
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,910
Anybody home?!

258
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,420
Pardon us!

259
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,530
Just go in!

260
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,620
It's locked from...

261
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,680
Oh, it's open.

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,170
What're you calling "open", idiot...

263
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,280
Hey! Is anyone home?

264
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,220
Gekko Moriah!

265
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,560
Is that all there is to this mansion? Not even a single servant around?

266
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,310
What's with this room? It looks like there's just been a fight.

267
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,860
It can't be, Nami-san was involved...!

268
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,870
You have a lot of guts to wander this far, knowing our master's name.

269
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,850
Eh?! There's a pig growing out of the wall.

270
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,480
Let's welcome our guests!

271
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,420
Hey, hey, are these zombies too?

272
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,900
It seems whatever it is, on this island it's bound to be unusual.

273
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,250
Where are you...

274
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,790
hiding Nami-san!?

275
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,140
It's un-ladylike to open your mouth that much.

276
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,640
Even if you're quite pretty.

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Eh? Really?

278
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,240
But you ruined it already once you leapt out of the picture frame.

279
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,450
Twist!

280
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,430
The spear broke!

281
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,530
What's with his body?! Is he iron!?

282
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,990
S-Stop it! What are you?!

283
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,670
Aren't you one of those other weaklings' friends?

284
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,410
Two Sword Style:

285
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,340
Double Slice.

286
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,340
{\an8}Rice

287
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,370
Rice? Sounds delicious!

288
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,370
Flash!

289
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,670
It was awful!

290
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,340
This island is really fun!

291
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,770
You! You nimble, little bastard!

292
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,200
If you hadn't gotten in our way, we probably would've gotten along!

293
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,210
Rubber...

294
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,920
Bazooka!

295
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,020
R-Rugbear!

296
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,460
Alright, all done.

297
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,640
Oh, you're talking about those three!

298
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,530
They're fast asleep in the bedroom right now.

299
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,780
Aren't you glad?

300
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
They're safe!

301
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,240
Like we'd believe that crap.

302
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,920
But it's true! Go see for yourself! It's the passage just up those stairs!

303
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,430
Hey, wait a sec...

304
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,930
The curly-brow cook is gone...

305
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,210
Huh? He was here just a second ago...

306
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,430
Where did Sanji go off to?

307
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
Hey, stop laughing! They'll hear you.

308
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,280
They must've done something at some point.

309
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,240
We've lost an important man.

310
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Hey, you..

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,330
But still, he's right. Sanji should be alright.

312
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,500
But in this zombie mansion, we should focus on rescuing the other three, shouldn't we?

313
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,680
You all... just because you're a little stronger, don't get cocky...

314
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Now that you've lost a friend, you'll show your true colours! Just look!

315
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,480
Anyways, it seems we have no other choice but to go cautiously.

316
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,050
Hey, you guys! Really-

317
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,130
I don't think these kids' stories were true.

318
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,570
In that case, let's take this pig with us as a guide.

319
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,250
Go on, go!

320
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,710
Wait, you...

321
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,180
It'll do you good to learn how fearsome our master is.

322
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,470
Our real boss is one of the Royal Seven Warlords of the Sea Gekko Mori-

323
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,260
I can't say it! It makes my soul freeze over!

324
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,860
Wah, it's bloodcurdling just saying that name!

325
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,610
Your missing friends are in trouble.

326
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,150
One, then another. Your friends will slowly disappear.

327
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,570
You should turn back.

328
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,240
But before one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea Gekko-

329
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,330
No, our master's true might, the terror will keep you from saving anyone!

330
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,300
Shut up and stop babbling.

331
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,720
Then tell that idiot Moriah this!

332
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,080
If anything happens to my crew...

333
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,830
I'll knock him off the face of this island!

334
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,430
Anyways, we'll leave Sanji alone, he won't die.

335
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,570
Let's go.

336
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,640
Dear Master,

337
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,370
For some reason, some very formidable guys have gotten into the mansion.

338
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,960
From the surprised Surprise Zombies.

339
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,220
Everybody circle the mansion!

340
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,220
{\an8}屋敷を囲めェ～

341
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,970
Let's Fiesta Night!

342
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,970
{\an8}レッツフィエスタナイッッ

343
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,460
Not a single pirate will get away!

344
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,460
{\an8}海賊達は一人たりとも逃がさない

345
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
Everybody! Zombie Night!

346
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
{\an8}エッビッバァリィ～ゾンビナイッ

347
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,530
Round and round and turn and die!

348
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,530
{\an8}ラウンド andラウンandターンandダーイ

349
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,650
Zombie night!!!

350
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,650
{\an8}ゾンビナーイッ！！！

351
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:59,050
Now all of our prey has wandered into our territory!

352
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,100
Tonight you may rampage as much as you please!

353
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,660
Awaken! General Zombies!

354
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,910
Be revived! Ancient Warriors!

355
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,220
The Straw Hat pirate crew has eight members.

356
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,230
Catch them soundly and bring them to our master!

357
