00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,460
Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,840
raising our battle cry.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,220
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,310
We were able to escape from the set course

Vegapunk Fansubs

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,860
along the boundary between sky and sea.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,110
Now we're rowing our way

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,620

Let's travel all through the worldwide seas,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,220
raising our battle cry.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,970
ring out.

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,030
is something I'll never forget.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,820
Because of that

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,490
nothing will be able to scare me...

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,750
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,670
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,350
while laughing out loud.

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,770
Give them all out at a big party

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,440
making a splash...

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,620
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,960
Spread your wings.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,290
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,630
you will move on.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,800
Get all the treasures

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,130
while laughing out loud.

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,490
Give them all out at a big party

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,270
making a splash...

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:38,610
{\an5}Number 900?!
Lola's Pursuit and the Humming Swordsman

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,760
Hey, what're you doing newcomer?!

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,740
It's impossible for us, zombies, to betray our master's orders...

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,350
How come he's disobeying?!

41
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,600
Moreover, he's as powerful as a general grade!

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,290
Put simply, that unstoppable power...

43
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,530
The power to make the impossible possible...

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,950
The name of the hurricane that knocks down all obstacles is...!

45
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,120
Love!

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,930
As I thought, all those ridiculous things that Dog Penguin is saying...

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,120
Are almost like Sanji's.

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,810
Hey, Dog Penguin!

49
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,610
Do you know something about Sanji?!

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,480
We're Sanji's friends, so...

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,920
Shut the hell up, pirates!

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,090
We're Sanji's friends, so...

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,610
He's our enemy after all!

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,460
What?

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,070
Now what?!

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,230
Wait, Lola!

57
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,340
A wild boar?

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,090
Hey!

59
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,550
Wait, Lola!

60
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,360
Come and catch me!

61
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,770
What?!

62
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,570
I finally found you...

63
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,310
Burglar Cat!

64
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,290
Me?!

65
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,860
W-Wait a minute!

66
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,690
I haven't stolen anything yet!

67
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,800
It's useless!

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,910
I won't let you have Ab-sama!

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,640
Don't lay a hand on this lady.

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,660
Don't butt in!

71
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,290
Dog Penguin!

72
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,610
Why didn't he attack?!

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,360
Even if I die...

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,140
I'll never hurt a woman!

75
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,920
Amazing!

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,160
To figure out that thing was a woman, you sure are something!

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
Usopp! Chopper!

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,820
I've got my bride!

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,230
Amazing, Nami is flying!

80
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,470
Idiots, I'm being kidnapped!

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,080
By who?!

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,970
Wait!

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,130
Well then, we shall start the ceremony right away!

84
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,540
I've already made the preparations!

85
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,400
Put me down!

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
You're the invisible man who was in the bathroom, aren't you?!

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,400
Could that be for real?!

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,020
Nami!

89
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,070
I've evaluated you.

90
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,890
You're most suitable to become my bride!

91
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,260
My name is Absalom!

92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,010
It's the name of your future husband.

93
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,910
Be sure to remember it!

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,360
You've got some nerve spying on naked people!

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,070
Keeping my body in shape everyday isn't something I do just to have some perverted beast spy on it!

96
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,910
Thunder Charge!

97
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,140
Nami!

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,430
Good job!

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,120
Let's just keep running!

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,860
We're getting outta this forest!

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,710
What?!

102
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,340
He hasn't fallen down!

103
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,820
He isn't just anyone, you can tell by looking at him!

104
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,730
What... is this shock running through my body...?

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,600
It's as if I had just been struck by a bolt of lightning!

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,290
Perhaps... this is...

107
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,030
Love?

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,260
You won't get away from me!

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Hey! This isn't time to stand without doing anything!

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
It is our job to capture those three!

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,090
You're right!

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,790
If we fail, Perona-sama's punishment awaits us!

113
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,590
No! They're going after that lady!

114
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,700
But, why am I protecting that girl?!

115
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,670
Moreover, I can't move...!

116
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,620
This body is too weak!

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,300
Hurry up and catch those three!

118
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,750
Wait, Wild Zombies!

119
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,960
Don't lay a hand on that woman!

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,000
Shut up, Perv-salom!

121
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,540
We receive orders from the master, but we're Perona-sama's subordinates!

122
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,220
I said wait!

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm aware that you are Perona's underlings.

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,370
However...!

125
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,060
You should still know not to make me angry.

126
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,030
Don't push your luck.

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,990
What do you want?!

128
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,910
I won't let you... go after that lady.

129
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,140
H-Hey, newcomer, stop!

130
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,580
Don't anger Absalom!

131
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,110
Wait, Burglar Cat!

132
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,200
Hey, Nami! She seems to be only after you!

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,950
You're right! What did I do?!

134
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,660
Why don't we split into two groups and escape?

135
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,860
You wanna leave me, cold-hearted monster?!

136
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,210
Come here, damn it!

137
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,030
The wild boar is so scary!

138
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,620
Could it be that they...

139
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,520
What're you bastards doing?!

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,880
Let me out!

141
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,800
just like Straw Hat now, were drawn into the other side of the wall?

142
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,320
Monkey! Monkey!

143
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,890
And soon you'll share the same fate!

144
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,770
You have invulnerable zombies coming from both sides.

145
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,730
Just give it up!

146
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,750
I can't figure out whether you're a dumbass spider or a dumbass monkey, but...

147
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,280
That huge spiderweb that the Sunny got caught in when we landed was your doing, wasn't it?

148
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,570
That's right!

149
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:44,480
All of your actions head right to Perona-sama's Ghost Network.

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
I wonder if those big ears also contribute to the info gathering.

151
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,920
They look like they could hear very well.

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,740
What did you say just now?

153
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,290
Stop pretending!

154
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,040
It's the worst case scenario.

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
We're completely surrounded.

156
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,140
It seems we urgently need a counter-measure.

157
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,610
Shall I take care of this?!

158
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,710
Do as you wish.

159
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,320
I'll try to deal with it.

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,990
I'm pretty reliable actually.

161
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,340
Well then, let's get started!

162
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,530
Wait! What're you gonna do?!

163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,530
Coup de...

164
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,470
Vent!

165
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
Wh...aaat?!

166
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,710
You... destroyed the bridge?!

167
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,080
Well, that's how it is.

168
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,390
As violent as always.

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,230
Cien Fleur...

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,230
{\an8}One Hundred Flowers

171
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,340
Wing!

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,420
You! You can fly?!

173
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,480
Yes, for about five seconds.

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,410
Too short!

175
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,890
No... but it's long enough.

176
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,920
Strong Right!

177
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,960
Alright! Got it!

178
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,810
Now if we can just make it to that entrance, we can follow Straw Hat!

179
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,610
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,050
This is my limit.

181
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,010
Pulling arm!

182
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,580
Everyone seems to have fallen into the courtyard.

183
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,320
This doesn't mean it's over, but...

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
They won't follow us for now.

185
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,070
That went fairly well.

186
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,120
You bastard!

187
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,950
How dare you use me as a stepping stone?!

188
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,070
Damn you!

189
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,050
This is unforgivable!

190
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,810
I'm a spider!

191
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,250
I'll get back there in no time!

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,510
What is... that?

193
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,590
What the...?

194
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,930
Is something... falling?

195
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,740
No!

196
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,120
Someone is coming!

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,400
Only bones!

198
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,790
Bone!

199
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,010
Hey, stop! Stop it!

200
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,540
Don't kill her! She's our friend!

201
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,650
Bastard!

202
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,840
Bastard, stop!

203
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,590
Hurry and escape, Nami!

204
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,890
Absalom is gonna be my groom!

205
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,330
Begone!

206
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,650
Prepare to die!

207
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,880
Wa-!

208
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
Wait a minute!

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,970
I-!

210
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,220
I'm...!

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,490
I'm actually a man!

212
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,060
Hey, hey.

213
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,260
Is that true?!

214
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,360
That's right!

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,750
It's a hobby of mine!

216
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,730
It's no joke!

217
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,190
Plus...

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,410
You and that beast man are perfect for each other!

219
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,510
I thought I could give you all my support!

220
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,640
Really?!

221
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,450
Really!

222
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,510
It's no joke!

223
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,390
No one has ever given me such supportive thoughts before.

224
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:21,610
You're the first person to ever have said such kind words to me.

225
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,470
I...

226
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,440
I...!

227
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,930
Raise your head, my friend.

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,080
This is called friendship.

229
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,710
My name is Namizou.

230
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,140
You may call me Nami.

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,060
Friendship...!

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,840
Nami!

233
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,650
She fell for it!

234
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,260
Of course you can't put his seal on while he's conscious.

235
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,510
If you do it while he's sleeping-

236
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,890
Attack while he's sleeping?!

237
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,850
Is that ok!? As a human being?!

238
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,300
But, aren't you a zombie, Lola?

239
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,530
That's mean! It's too low!

240
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,360
It's alright as long as he's sleeping and doesn't notice.

241
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,230
Hey, Namizou.

242
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,800
Can we get out of here now?

243
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,990
By the way, Lola...

244
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,930
I dropped something earlier in the treasure storehouse...

245
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,540
I want it back but, I can't remember the way. Can you tell me?

246
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,040
Silly you.

247
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,200
But it's fine.

248
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,380
The closest way is right through Lady Perona's room over there.

249
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,190
Do you see it?

250
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,660
She's completely taken in... she's not gonna come out of it.

251
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,140
See that incredibly high tower over there?

252
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,700
If you go straight that way you will come across the stairs that lead to it.

253
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,700
So Nami was a man all along...

254
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,760
I always thought she acted kinda manly.

255
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,970
Hey Nami, that guy has caught up to us.

256
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,180
Really?!

257
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,500
Lola! Attack chance!

258
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,570
I'll never meet him again, so you'll be fine!

259
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,260
Do your best! You two will be the best couple!

260
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,050
Thank you, Nami!

261
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,550
I'm full of courage now!

262
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,830
Absalom!

263
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,020
Lola!

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
You two, this is our chance!

265
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,210
The wild boar didn't harm Nami after all.

266
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,900
Nami, you're incredible!

267
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,630
If you talk to her, you'll realize she's not so bad after all.

268
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,070
You have a weird look again!

269
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,540
Not a single treasure chest in the whole ship?!

270
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, there are some, but they're almost empty.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,010
All that's left is just a small amount of money.

272
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,860
I'm surprised that these two ships gave us almost no spoils.

273
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,430
Is this really the ship of the man who beat Crocodile?

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,790
Well, it's fine.

275
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,820
Carry out some rations, if there are any.

276
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,700
Yes.

277
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,410
Perona-sama!

278
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
Hildon.

279
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,380
Moria-sama has summoned the Three Mystery Persons.

280
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,820
Master?

281
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
What for?

282
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,960
It seems Straw Hat Luffy has been captured.

283
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
It's time to awaken Number 900.

284
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,140
Number 900?!

285
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,280
Are you serious?!

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,050
Ab-sama!

287
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,280
Absalom, you bastard! Come out and marry me!

288
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,750
You disappeared and ran again, didn't you?!

289
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,830
Strange...

290
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,170
There's nowhere else they could have run to.

291
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,970
Hey, Kumashi!

292
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,510
Absalom-sama, I've got a problem...

293
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,860
Something's bothering me...

294
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,170
Wait, my issues come first.

295
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,020
Have three pirates come through here?

296
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,370
That's...

297
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,940
Absalom!

298
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,330
What're you doing here?

299
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,590
This is my room.

300
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,690
Perona.

301
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,170
Welcome back, Perona-sama...

302
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,560
Don't talk, Kumashi!

303
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
How many times do I have to tell you?!

304
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,710
But, there's something impo-

305
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,630
Be quiet!

306
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,620
Don't speak.

307
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,520
You are as severe as ever with Kumashi...

308
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,290
Sevearsy.

309
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,300
Quiet, he's my subordinate.

310
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,980
More importantly, have you heard?

311
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,940
Master is calling for us.

312
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,150
Did something happen?

313
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,230
Did something happen? I'll tell you what happened!

314
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,560
Number 900 is gonna be awakened.

315
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,100
The 900?!

316
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,820
Did he capture that 300 million man?!

317
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,810
Somehow, we're still barely hiding from them.

318
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,520
Did he capture that 300 million man?!

319
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,110
It's a miracle.

320
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,350
Then again, why're we hiding in such place?!

321
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,250
We had no choice!

322
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,610
I didn't think that beast man would catch up with us so fast!

323
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,650
Moreover, I don't think that guy's a zombie.

324
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,960
We'll get outta here once we get the chance, alright?

325
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
Absalom-sama!

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,870
So you were here.

327
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,760
I've brought interesting information.

328
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,590
What is it?

329
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,700
There's another trespasser along with the pirates.

330
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,470
Trespasser?

331
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,930
The "Humming" Chivalrous Swordsman.

332
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,600
What?!

333
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,650
Someone... fell from the sky.

334
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,150
Hey, what was it that fell just now?

335
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,400
Could it be...

336
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,780
Well...

337
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,870
I can tell by looking at the mark...

338
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,240
That was a strange interruption, but you're not gonna get away from me.

339
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,180
I can make as many footholds as I need.

340
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,680
Monkey! Monkey!

341
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,580
You, buy me some time.

342
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,350
What're you gonna do?

343
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,770
These are some fine stone pillars you have here.

344
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm gonna make a little weapon.

345
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,870
Spider...

346
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,490
Sticky Net!

347
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,660
From the glands in his hands...

348
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
Seis Fleur...

349
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
{\an8}Six Flowers

350
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,290
Slap!

351
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,370
Something touched my eye!

352
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,090
I'm stuck!

353
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,070
I got myself with the sticky net!

354
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,640
Alright, Nico Robin, I'm ready.

355
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,130
Step back.

356
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,390
What is that?

357
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,540
What, I just took the iron nunchucks I was carrying and jammed them in these pillars.

358
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,340
With a monster this huge, you need an equally huge weapon.

359
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,510
Heavy Nunchaku!

360
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,380
What's with his power...

361
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,830
Is he... actually human?

362
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,780
Stop it, bastard!

363
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,610
Spider Sticky Net!

364
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,270
Weapons...

365
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,270
Left!

366
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,830
Nico Robin!

367
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,000
What're those things?!

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,500
Mouse! Mouse!

369
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm sorry...

370
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,360
I let my guard down.

371
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,460
I hadn't thought there were other spiders.

372
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,680
D-Damn it!

373
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,920
Idiots...

374
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,260
Monkey, Monkey...

375
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,170
It's not about whether you let your guard down or not.

376
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,790
These are my subordinates, the Spider Mice.

377
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,130
There are as many as 500 of them here on Thriller Bark.

378
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,420
We've never let even a single prey we've caught escape!

379
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,130
We wait everywhere to ambush. From the darkness and blind spots we capture our enemy.

380
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,800
Our thread has been modified by Hogback-sama so that no human strength can tear it!

381
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,580
From above the ceiling while in the mansion, we carried away your friends.

382
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,980
Now, we'll take you to the same place as your friends.

383
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,360
Resign yourselves!

384
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,980
ヨホホホー
Yohohohoo

385
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,600
ヨーホホーホー
Yoohoohohoo

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,040
ヨホホホー
Yohohohoo

387
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,920
Who is it?

388
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,890
Who's singing?!

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,450
ヨーホホーホー
Yoohoohohoo

390
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,640
ビンクスの酒を
Going to deliver Bink's sake...

391
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:44,220
届けにゆくよ海風気まかせ波まかせ
Doing as one pleases, following the sea breeze between the waves...

392
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:51,170
潮の向こうで夕日も騒ぐ
On the other side of the tide, alarmed at the setting sun...

393
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,490
空にゃ輪をかく鳥の唄
Drawing a circle in the sky, the song of a bird.

394
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,280
My, my, it seems that everyone has come to this island.

395
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,430
How did you get here from below?

396
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,600
I jumped. I'm very light after all.

397
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,250
If you've come, then I suppose there's no choice.

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,750
I'll tell you all about this island.

399
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Hey, bastard! Who're you?!

400
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,210
You're not a zombie!

401
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,130
You're one of the pirates' friends, aren't you?!

402
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,670
Hey, skeleton!

403
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes, yes.

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
It's alright...

405
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,980
I've put an end to the battle.

406
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,520
Three-Pace Hum:

407
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,920
Notch Slash!
