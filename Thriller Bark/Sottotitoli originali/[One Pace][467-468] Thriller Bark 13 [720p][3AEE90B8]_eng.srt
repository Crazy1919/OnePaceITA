raising our battle cry.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350

ring out.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,530
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,710
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,390
while laughing out loud.

28
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,810
Give them all out at a big party

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,440
making a splash...

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,660
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,000
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,660
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,840
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,180
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,540
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,310
making a splash...

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,040
{\an5}Zoro vs. Ryuuma and
Chopper's Rage!

39
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,260
He made a hole!

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,930
To send the stab flying... it takes a lot of strength.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,510
A draw it seems.

42
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,650
You almost got me.

43
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,440
What? When did that waistband guy counterattack?!

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,070
It was almost... at the same time...

45
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,120
That person's slash also flew...

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,360
That samurai zombie moves thanks to my shadow,

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,750
but he must truly have been
an extraordinary samurai when alive.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,130
It is possible that those two have the same type of strength as swordsmen.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,430
It means they possess the same destructive power.

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,100
This match won't take too long.

51
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,190

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,960
A weapon breaking technique?!

Two Swords Style...

56
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,970
Flash!

57
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,380
Demon Bear!

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,530
Gavotte...

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,760

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,060

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,280
Sword Draw...

63
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,800
Castle Gate!

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,340
He got me!

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,560
The pillars broke!

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,630
H-Hold on a minute! Hey!

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,430
The whole floor is gonna collapse!

68
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,520
This is dangerous!

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,410
Hang on tight, we're outta here!

70
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,170
The ceiling is coming down!

71
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,900
Seventy-two Pound Cannon!

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,900
{\an8}Phoenix of the Seventy-two Earthly Desires

73
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,100
Polka Continuation!

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,250
Weapons Left!

75
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,340
That was close!

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,860
Watch out! You'll fall!

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm slipping!

78
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,920
How can they get a foothold?

79
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,600
If this keeps up, my blades will end up breaking...

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,990
The body and skill of this corpse is almost the same as the legendary samurai himself.

81
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,320
One Sword Style...

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,460
Flying Dragon...

83
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,900
Three Pace Hum...

84
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,050
Notch Slash!

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,900
Blaze!

86
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,220
Did his wound just ignite?

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,110
I lost.

88
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,520
Shuusui, the famous sword that once served a legendary samurai.

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,520
{\an8}Shuusui: Clear Autumn Water

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,210
Surely this sword will be satisfied under your command.

91
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,710
Did that samurai just say something?

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,010
So that means...

93
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,180
w-what exactly?

94
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,990
It means...

95
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,680
that the match is over!

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,620
I've never seen a battle like this!

97
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,400
That samurai...

98
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,270
never fought against me seriously!

99
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,750
And some fight that was.

100
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,030
I feel sorry for...

101
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,500
giving this samurai body a complete defeat...

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,240
Having the feeling of shame is enough...

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,560
That's what makes a true swordsman in both body and soul.

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,260
I wish I could've met you when you were alive.

105
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,680
T-This is...!

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,870
It's back!

107
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,020
After five long years, my shadow is finally back!

108
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,430
I'll be taking the sword, but...

109
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,340
let's pretend this duel never happened,

110
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,700
samurai of Wano Country.

111
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,660
Well? How does it feel
to get captured by your own friends?

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,130
You failed to feed me salt with that weird ability!

113
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,840
He's strong...

114
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,460
Damn! I never thought Sanji would kick Robin!

115
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,820
This creature is no longer Sanji!

116
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,420
Who's this Sanji?

117
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,260
I'll kill you, damn bastard.

118
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,520
Unfortunately for you, they no longer have memories of being your friends.

119
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,950
Fresh zombies may have
remains of their former selves,

120
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,700
but now that the body and shadow have merged completely...

121
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,030
their humanity is gone for good.

122
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,510
They're my loyal zombies now!

123
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,220
And for a zombie, orders are absolute!

124
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,020
I'm almost glad that you've fallen this low, Hogback!

125
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,870
You once saved numerous human lives,
that's why I deeply admired you as a doctor,

126
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,520
even your zombie research.

127
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,720
Death...

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,690
it comes without warning...

129
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:11,890
Because of this, many things are left unsaid between those dead and those left behind...

130
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,600
Not for many years...

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,490
just a few minutes would be enough!

132
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,550
If there was a way to bring back the dead for even a brief moment...

133
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,490
even if it was an evil and heretical practice...

134
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,040
it would be hugely appreciated by those who were brought back!

135
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,340
That's why, when you spoke of raising the dead, I thought your words were...

136
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,140
worthy of a true doctor!

137
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,680
Fool! Why would I do that for strangers?!

138
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,690
They requested my aid for the same reason you admired me!

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was because I was a genius!

140
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,190
It was all about the money!

141
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,430
I didn't want to help all those patients who kept coming incessantly from all over the world!

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,450
"Please help my father!"

143
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,770
"Save my child!"

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,320
"Help my boyfriend!"

145
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,370
What a huge annoyance!

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,340
So troublesome.

147
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,380
I had to pay for the incompetence of all those pathetic doctors who couldn't even save a life.

148
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,930
Can you comprehend the trouble of being such a genius?!

149
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,780
Whether you respect me or not is up to you,

150
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,150
but the mere fact that I disappointed you is ridiculous.

151
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,170
If you can't stand me as a doctor because of your absurd ideals...

152
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,470
Then you're deceiving yourself, stupid reindeer!

153
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,710
You want to tell me what a doctor should be?!{edited for clarity - Sky}

154
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,970
I don't intend to tell you anything!{Retranslated to match previous line - Sky}

155
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,950
I don't think of you as a doctor anymore!

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,620
The same goes for those zombies!

157
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,910
They're just empty shells moving to your will!

158
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,620
They're not alive!

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't play with life!

160
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
What a cruel statement.

161
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,450
You deny their livelihood despite seeing them move before your very eyes?!

162
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,060
Granting a new life to the dead is a true miracle!

163
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,930
How can you possibly deny the existence of this?!

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,090
Look!

165
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Now then, lick the floor, Cindry.{the first , seems appropriate here, should probably leave it}{added "then" to give it proper pacing in english - Sky}

166
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,700
Yes, Hogback-sama.

167
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,100
You saw that room, didn't you, Dr. Chopper?

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,940
That's my room.

169
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,550
All those were pictures of the stage actress Victoria Cindry, back when she was alive.

170
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,260
I completely fell in love with her.

171
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,670
Not only me, but men from the entire country, fell for such beauty.

172
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,770
It's fixed now, Doctor.

173
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,090
S-Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb my patient just to get my buttons sewn!

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,170
It's no problem!

175
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,130
A very popular yet unpretentious person...

176
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,620
devoted to her family,

177
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,210
She was kind to everyone... truly a wonderful woman.

178
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,220
but she...

179
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,000
rejected my proposal, the proposal of a doctor who had everything...

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,190
All because of that accursed fiancé of hers...!

181
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,480
And then...

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,610
Unbelievable news reached my ears...

183
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,630
Cindry... died in an accident.

184
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,540
My pain was indescribable...

185
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,360
I abandoned my work...

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,630
It was then that a huge man appeared before me...

187
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,210
My master, Gekko Moriah!

188
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,410
Dr. Hogback, lend me your power!

189
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:18,060
So we agreed that, in exchange for resurrecting Cindry with his miraculous ability, I would stay on this ship.{maybe we should split this into 3 parts? to avoid the sceene bleeding? -punkid}

190
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,940
I stole her body...

191
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,400
and by doing so, I easily gained control over the actress Cindry!

192
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,220
Cindry-chan!

193
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,440
It would be best if all the plates disappear...

194
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,250
I didn't care about who the woman was inside her body...

195
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,610
As long as she had her beauty...

196
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,170
That's Cindry-chan's zombie!

197
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,010
I'm full of joy, and so is she.

198
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,600
I granted her a second opportunity to live as a human in this world!

199
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,820
How can you call this human?!

200
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,650
Make her stop!

201
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,540
A person with no connection between heart and body can't be called human!

202
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,080
If you're using soulless bodies...

203
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,100
you're just creating monsters!

204
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,420
You make people unhappy by creating those zombies!

205
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,800
Now that I'm aware of this, I won't let you off!

206
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Don't talk to me about "life" with your limited medical skills, pirate-deer!{edited to sound more like an insult - Sky}

207
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,310
Cindry-chan, get rid of them!

208
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,890
I'll turn you both into marionettes!

209
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,600
You should be grateful, Dr. Chopper.

210
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,570
When you die, you'll become
the assistant of the person you admired!

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,450
Angular Edge Plate...

212
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,510
One!

213
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,450
Two!

214
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,070
Three!

215
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,370
Stop...

216
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,620
Bastard!

217
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,130
Chopper!

218
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,380
Don't look down on her just because she's a woman!

219
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,600
I've increased her strength for battle!

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,750
You don't have to listen to him!

221
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,900
I will kill you!

222
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,520
I feel bad for you. You're already dead.

223
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,430
How would the rest of your family feel if they knew about this?!

224
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,870
Let me... go!

225
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,340
Covered with patches, becoming just a mindless soldier...

226
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,620
Your relatives wouldn't bear to see you like this...

227
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,380
You damned... let me go!

228
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,550
The heart you were born with is dead now...

229
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,770
Your body moves under other people's wills...

230
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,180
What kind of life is that?!

231
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,440
You doubt your eyes?!

232
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,060
Accept it! This is the eternal dream of humans, revival of the dead!

233
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,900
The dead have been resurrected!

234
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,060
So if they can move, it's enough?!

235
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,840
Humans have more freedom than that!

236
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,080
You are not even treating them as humans!

237
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,870
Robin! Hurry and give her salt!

238
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,450
Dog-pen!

239
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,240
Jigoro!

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,810
Help Cindry!

241
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,810
Get rid of that nuisance!

242
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
I failed!

243
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,900
Chopper!

244
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,820
Three Swords Style...

245
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,420
One-hundred and Eight...

246
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,650
Pound Cannon!

247
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,350
Stop it, Zoro!

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,350
Doce Fleur!

249
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,350
{\an8}Twelve Flowers

250
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,400
You nuisance...

251
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,350
Disappear!

252
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,870
Why'd you attack me too?!

253
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,620
Don't get in my way!

254
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,460
Now you made me angry!

255
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,590
That'd be you!

256
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,210
I received that order!

257
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,380
It was me!

258
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,600
Hey, what're you doing?!

259
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,180
Cut it out already!

260
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,270
You should be coopera-

261
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,170
Robin!

262
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,400
Such an amusing incident, don't you think?

263
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
All because of the order given to get rid of the nuisances.

264
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,890
Even with their memories erased...

265
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,700
It seems that the true nature of those two is to always be in conflict.

266
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,970
I'm shocked...

267
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,740
This seems like a tall tower.

268
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,000
Why don't you try telling us to jump off it?{Off of here? Remove 'from here'?}{The tower is mentioned in the last line, so "it" is fine - Sky}{dat grammar}

269
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,340
What're you implying?!

270
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,420
That's exactly what I'll say!

271
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,590
Jump! Jump!

272
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,970
You two there, jump off!

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,010
Yes.

274
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,060
N-No, wait!

275
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,760
We'd rather not.

276
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,790
This is unforgivable!

277
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,930
You tricked me!

278
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,900
You're the lowest!

279
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,410
You're not human!

280
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,090
All the zombies will be purified once Luffy takes out Moriah...

281
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,450
I just want to pummel you, Hogback!

282
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,260
Cindry!

283
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,750
Buy me some time!

284
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,430
I'm getting out of here!

285
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,320
Why don't you answer?!

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,260
If you lose, I'll just give you another shadow!

287
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,900
Don't worry about dying!{Reworded - Sky}

288
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,880
My body...

289
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,400
won't move.

290
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,780
C-Cindry!
