raising our battle cry.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,640
ring out.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
We were able to escape from the set course

ring out.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,570
That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,070
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,840
Because of that

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,510
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,780
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,720
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
Get all the treasures

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,400
while laughing out loud.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,800
Give them all out at a big party

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,440
making a splash...

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,650
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,990
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,330
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,660
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,830
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,170
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,520
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,310

Oars and Moriah vs. the Straw Hats!

39
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,200
Brook... you can move again?

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,740
You saved me. Thanks a lot.

41
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,630
Certainly, I was seriously injured.

42
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,570
And as I bravely dragged my body to the kitchen in my quest for salt...

43
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,280
I discovered a bottle of delicious milk and drank it, giving these results!

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
There's no way for calcium to be that effective!

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,270
Milk can heal broken bones!

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,260
Liar!

47
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, at any rate... we've obtained a large amount of salt at the very last minute.

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,080
The way to the kitchen is blocked now.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,960
The salt that Brook has brought is our last hope.

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,210
We're short on time.

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,070
We have to fight!

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,910
If we make that monster swallow the salt,

53
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,950
And then beat Moriah immediately afterwards, we can win.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,040
You should be grateful that I came out to fight!

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,880
Also, I'd be extremely careful if I were you.

56
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,330
I'm not here without a reason!

57
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll make you experience your worst nightmare!

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,040
Allow me to join your fight, as I promise to fight with all my might!

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,680
I can't think of any other way to repay the great favor of recovering my shadow!

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
I shall...!

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,050
Creak...

62
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,560
Don't push yourself.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,890
Just hang on to that salt.

64
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,510
I'll show you something special.

65
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,020
My anti-monster rounds.

66
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Gotta take the initiative.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,550
The last one was too small for you.

68
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,910
Franky, I'm counting on you!

69
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,560
Deadly Special Oil Star!

70
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,900
Of course! Got it!

71
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,360
Transform!

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,300
Super Size... Fire Bird Star!

73
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,590
Hot! Hot! Hot!

74
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,070
How shameful.

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,990
Don't panic, Oars.

76
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,810
Heat and pain were hindrances in your human era.

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,730
Such things have no effect on zombies.

78
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,700
Calm down and get rid of those flames.

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,990
This is our chance, Zoro!

80
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,970
Alright!

81
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,750
Three Swords Style...

82
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,000
Great Buddha Slash!

83
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,560
Eat this!

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,250
Jenga Cannon!

85
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,480
You bastard!

86
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,760
They're coming this way!

87
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,840
Veinte Fleur!

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,840
{\an8}Twenty Flowers

89
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,710
Stop it, you idiot!

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Damn it!

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
He used it against us!

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,870
Hey, are you alright?!

93
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,040
New Weapon... Kuwagata!

94
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,040
{\an8}Kuwagata: stag beetle

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,750
Is everything ready, Usopp?!

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,660
Y-Yeah, but building this was quite absurd!

97
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,720
I don't even know what'll happen.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,790
No need to worry, you idiot.

99
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,290
I feel especially super this week!

100
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,720
Then, get on!

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,570
You bet!

102
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,160
Give it all you got!

103
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,240
Here goes!

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,060
Deadly Ironman Meteor!

105
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,320
Now that's what I call super!

106
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,370
Say your prayers!

107
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,340
This is a special mortar designed to bring down Sea Kings!

108
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,750
I'll make a hole in that face of yours!

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,450
Take this, Moriah!

110
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,570
What impressive agility!

111
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,530
I tend to forget we're actually fighting Luffy here!

112
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,340
Franky!

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,650
Franky!

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,020
Not done yet, Oars.

115
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,800
He's still breathing.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,220
Finish him off!

117
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,880
Yes.

118
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,510
Hey, he's gonna do it again!

119
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,290
Stop, he can't even move!

120
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,180
Thunderbolt...!

121
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,930
Huh? That cloud!

122
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,990
Tempo!

123
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,900
Lightning!

124
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,320
This attack is...!

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,800
It worked!

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,090
He's down!

127
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,830
It's the Clima-Tact!

128
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,760
Is Nami-san alright?!

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
What was that flash just now?!

130
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,390
Lightning?!

131
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,630
So suddenly?!

132
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,090
Oars was hit by a bolt of lightning!

133
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,240
Most likely!

134
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,700
There she is!

135
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,550
It's Nami-san!

136
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,320
Nami-san!

137
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,160
Hey, stop yelling my name! He'll notice me, you know!

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,700
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm so glad Nami-san is okay!

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,390
Thank goodness!

141
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,980
Please forgive my incompetence!

142
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,930
Nami-san!

143
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,930
Why doesn't he shut up?

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,910
Woman...

145
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,800
I told you!

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,970
Rubber...

147
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,900
W-What?! What?!

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,610
Don't tell me it's gonna stretch!

149
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,470
It won't reach her.

150
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,730
This is our chance!

151
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,210
Go help Franky!

152
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,630
Pistol!

153
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,160
I-It stretched!

154
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,340
Why?!

155
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,700
It stretched.

156
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,300
No wonder I always had that feeling.

157
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,730
That's impossible!

158
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,250
Nami!

159
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,250
Nami-san!

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,240
I see her!

161
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
Nami is safe!

162
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,770
Thank goodness.

163
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,500
Robin saved her!

164
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,610
That came out of nowhere.

165
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,080
Are you alright, Nami?

166
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,190
Thank you so much... for helping me.

167
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,540
This is definitely no good!

168
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,960
Why the hell did his arm stretch?!

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,970
There's only one rubber man in the world!

170
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,710
Moriah... He's behind all this.

171
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,840
Rubber...

172
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,800
Whip!

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,650
Now he's nothing but a monstrous Luffy!

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,410
Who the hell are you?!

175
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm in a hurry right now!

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
What do you want?!

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Yes, we know you are.

178
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,690
We're aware you have no time to lose.

179
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,330
Just give us a minute!

180
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,110
You're our only hope.

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,440
We've been looking for you!

182
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,900
We're the Risky Brothers, henchmen of Lola the Proposer, Captain of the Rolling Pirates.

183
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,410
You want to defeat Gekko Moriah, don't you?

184
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,300
Don't you?

185
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,340
We know the secret to Moriah's ability.

186
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,570
It'll grant you insurmountable power!

187
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,260
So please beat him for us.

188
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,920
Secret? Power?

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,950
What do you say?

190
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,170
That's why I'm asking you: what's on your mind?!

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,650
Allow me to introduce her.

192
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,960
The Captain of the Rolling Pirates, Lola the Proposer.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Her current total of proposals is 4,443.

194
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,940
My! I like you.

195
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,110
Marry me.

196
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,260
No.

197
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,640
He rejected her!

198
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,850
That's the 4,444th person who's rejected her!

199
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,280
Anyway, we're part of the group of victims that have been stripped off their shadows...

200
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,850
And are doomed to wander the forest.

201
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,050
I also had my shadow stolen, so I have no time to lose!

202
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,830
You're Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?

203
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:32,040
In any case, there's never been so much chaos in Thriller Bark before!

204
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Moriah's three servants have been obliterated and there's barely anything left of his mansion.

205
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,510
Yeah, we all have been very excited since you came.

206
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,720
But... rumor has it that the enemy's trump card, the Special Zombie, has been awakened!

207
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,960
We receive information via our Victim Network.

208
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,830
We've been without shadow for three years now!

209
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,450
We don't wanna keep living like this!

210
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,770
If you manage to defeat Moriah, we can all have our shadows back!

211
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,150
Then again, we're in trouble!

212
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,420
Do you know Moriah's current location?

213
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,920
Inside his belly!

214
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,910
He's inside that monster's belly!

215
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,440
What?! He was eaten?!

216
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,120
That's not it.

217
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
He's riding in his belly.

218
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,150
Basically, unless you defeat the special zombie which has your shadow, you won't be able to reach Moriah.

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,670
He's fighting your friends in the mansion's courtyard.

220
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,080
What?!

221
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,340
Damn it!

222
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,540
Then I have no time to lose!

223
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,060
I told you to wait!

224
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,250
Save the sluggish explanations for later!

225
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,800
Showing him an example is faster!

226
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
An example of the shadows' secret we've discovered!

227
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,440
Yes!

228
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,130
Move it! Move it!

229
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,140
Here it comes!

230
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,310
A shadow?

231
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,330
Yes, a shadow!

232
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,620
Shadows that are released upon feeding a zombie with salt can be grabbed with your bare hands!

233
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,500
Here goes!

234
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,180
W-What's all this?!

235
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,810
You're stabbing me with a shadow!

236
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,810
Hang in there.

237
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,050
Stop!

238
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,730
I'm losing consciousness...

239
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,190
Alright!

240
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,000
It's in!

241
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,970
Well?

242
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
Are you back to your senses?

243
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,780
Yeah.

244
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,500
Can you use a sword?

245
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,510
Not... in the very least.

246
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
W-What happened?!

247
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,130
The shadow which entered your body just now... is that of a skilled marine swordsman.

248
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,290
All the power the shadow possesses is added to your own!

249
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,910
Furthermore, you can keep adding shadows as long as you hold on to your senses!

250
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,920
Amazing, isn't it?!

251
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,170
We can take advantage of Moriah's ability to dramatically increase your strength!

252
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,650
We've caught plenty of shadows.

253
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,960
However; if you don't have a strong mind and easily go unconscious, all the power will be wasted.

254
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,920
How come you have that many shadows?

255
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,280
In order to find our shadows, we've been desperately purifying zombie after zombie.

256
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,880
But we only found shadows of people we didn't know.

257
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,340
So we started capturing them instead.

258
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,690
Listen, be sure to remember this.

259
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,460
When a shadow is put into a corpse, that corpse becomes a zombie, but...

260
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,150
When it's put into a human with a soul and mind of its own, it can't settle down.

261
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,300
Your power-up will last 10 minutes, at best.

262
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,140
After that, the shadow will go back to its original owner.

263
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,580
Do you understand?

264
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,920
It's a 10 minute match.

265
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,470
All the shadows we've risked our lives to capture, will be given to you!

266
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,560
That many?!

267
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,180
The fog has already cleared. That means we only have 20 minutes of night left to strike.

268
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,870
Anyway, we've gotta hurry.

269
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,780
Hold on to your senses!

270
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,280
You should be able to handle 20 or 30 shadows!

271
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,450
Our limit is 2 or 3, at most.

272
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,350
Go ahead!

273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
W-Wait a minute!

274
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,270
Isn't it too soon-

275
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,620
T-This man...!

276
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,450
What kind of mind does he possess?!

277
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,650
I can't believe my eyes...

278
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,940
He absorbed 100 shadows straight!

279
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,450
Unbelievable!

280
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,440
As expected from our ray of hope!

281
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,210
H-Hey!

282
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,120
How are you feeling?

283
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,700
Are you still you?

284
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
Straw Hat Luffy!

285
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah.

286
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,120
It's me.

287
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,860
The power keeps... overflowing!

288
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,760
Somehow... you...

289
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,480
You've changed...

290
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,990
You were a bit smaller before.

291
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,670
I'd never imagined this kid would be this strong.

292
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,830
The thirst for battle...

293
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,390
Is burning inside me!

294
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,400
You're ready to go!

295
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,130
Now, there's no time!

296
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,900
Show that accursed Moriah what nightmares are all about!

297
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,640
You're our last ray of hope!

298
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,070
Nightmare Luffy!

299
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,810
Just you wait!

300
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,920
Moriah!

301
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,610
Wait a minute!

302
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,620
You're going the wrong way!

303
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,070
Rubber...

304
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,820
Here he comes!

305
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,140
Bell!

306
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,180
I feel better now that I can stretch.

307
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,020
Spear!

308
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,780
Damn, what's going on?!

309
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,070
His attack power has greatly increased!

310
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,590
Why can Oars' body stretch without having a devil fruit's power?!

311
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,670
What did you do, Moriah?!

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,990
Yes! The real nightmare starts now!

313
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,310
Behold the Shadow power!

314
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,020
Shadow Revolution!

315
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,690
R-Revolution?

316
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,210
Shadows are bound to follow the body's orders.

317
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,890
That's common sense.

318
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,400
Body and shadow will always share the same form.

319
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,290
That is an inviolable rule.

320
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,440
However, right now...

321
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,530
Oars' shadow, which should be serving its body, is being manipulated by my own shadow.

322
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,780
Can you tell what is happening?

323
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,300
I can change the shape of Oars' shadow at will.

324
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,340
However, body and shadow must have the same shape.

325
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:03,040
In order for body and shadow to be the same, the body is forced to obey the shadow and change with it.

326
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,460
A shadow revolution!

327
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,260
In other words, by reversing common sense,

328
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,250
Moriah forced Oars' shadow to stretch, and thus the body was forced to stretch as well.

329
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,840
So... it's not like Oars has turned into a rubber man...

330
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,180
He has become a monster that can turn into anything!

331
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,520
How convenient, for such a big monster!

332
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,350
Yeah, now it won't be easy to get near him.

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,360
Soon you'll realize it's worse than rubber!

334
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,160
If I make his shadow round,

335
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,200
Oars will do the same!

336
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,070
Oars Ball!

337
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,470
Take this!

338
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,120
Run away!

339
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,470
Hey, hey! Wait a second, Master!

340
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,300
Stop messing with my fight!

341
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,920
Sorry for that.

342
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,590
I didn't mean to spoil your fun.

343
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm here to give you a hand and nothing more.

344
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,370
Now, Oars, make sure to crush them one by one.

345
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,410
It's dangerous to get too close, Zoro!

346
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,960
Hey, where's Luffy anyway?!

347
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,480
Moriah tricked him into going somewhere else.

348
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,120
He better be alright!

349
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,390
How come?

350
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,080
He's a real idiot for sure.

351
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,330
What should I do?

352
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,710
I wonder if I should tell everyone, in this situation,

353
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,060
that there is another Warlord of the Sea on the island.

354
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,890
So the situation is: We got to beat Luffy's zombie first, then Moriah or else we won't recover our shadows?

355
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,650
Is it that kind of situation?

356
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,390
Yes, it's as you say.

357
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,150
No way!

358
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,720
It'll be morning anytime now!

359
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
That's what the enemy wants!

360
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,950
We have no choice!

361
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,350
Excuse me.

362
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,840
Skeleton, you were here all along?

363
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
I have a...

364
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,470
I have a favor to ask you!

365
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,800
Please listen!

366
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,460
Everyone, thank you very much!

367
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
It's a simple request.

368
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,710
Are you sure about this, Brook?!

369
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,830
You saw what happened to Franky, didn't you?!

370
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm not responsible if anything happens!

371
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
Get ready, as this is very powerful!

372
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,480
Dark Cloud Tempo...

373
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,180
Please, go ahead!

374
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,650
To think I have to use Kuwagata again!

375
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,870
There's nothing more painful than an unpaid debt!

376
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,830
Don't hold back! Give it all you got!

377
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,310
Alright! Get going!

378
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,450
Here I go!

379
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,880
Slalom Vine!

380
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Such a great shock that my bones can be seen!

381
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,300
Then again, bones are all I have left!

382
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
Here I come!

383
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,430
Like an arrow of lightning!

384
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,870
Lighting Bone Sword...

385
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
Gavotte Bon Avant!

386
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
{\an8}Bon Avant: Leap Forward

387
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,170
Awesome!

388
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,330
He went right through him!

389
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,140
My shoulder was pierced!

390
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,170
He's off-guard!

391
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,210
Let's strike again!

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,150
M-Mission...

393
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,150
accomplished.

394
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,500
Nice job, bones!

395
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,820
Two Swords Style...

396
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,370
Double Slash...

397
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,270
Tower Climb!

398
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,490
You!

399
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,450
No, first of all...

400
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,390
I'll finish off this skeleton!

401
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,320
Rubber...

402
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,060
I-Is he going to...?

403
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,430
Rubber...

404
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,180
Battle Axe!

405
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,060
Brook!

406
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,170
Deadly...

407
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,810
Atlas Comet!

408
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,410
It's no use!

409
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,150
Not good.

410
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,300
Usopp, fight!

411
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,040
Fight...

412
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,320
Hey, hey wait!

413
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,260
You're next, nose bastard!

414
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,320
Rubber...

415
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,150
Bazooka!

416
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,040
I'm dead!

417
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,040
Bazooka!

418
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,200
It won't stretch.

419
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,390
Why?

420
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,070
Ochenta Fleur...

421
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,070
{\an8}Eighty Flower

422
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,920
Cuatro Manos!

423
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,920
{\an8}Four Hands

424
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,310
What's with these hands?!

425
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,500
I can't move!

426
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,170
Yes, I thought I'd have you stop your shadow manipulation.
