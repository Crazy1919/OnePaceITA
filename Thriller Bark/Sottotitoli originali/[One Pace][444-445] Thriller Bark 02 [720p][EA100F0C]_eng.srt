raising our battle cry.

If you've made up your mind, let the signal for departure

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,630
ring out.

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,340

Now we're rowing our way

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,670

That feeling we had when we set sail

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,050
is something I'll never forget.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,860
Because of that

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,540
nothing will be able to scare me...

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,770
Now, as the trip approaches, our racing heartbeats

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,720
engrave a rhythm of adventure in our shy hearts.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090

making a splash...

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,650
Fill your empty heart with dreams.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,990
Spread your wings.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,310
If you color your heart with the blowing wind

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,650
you will move on.

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,830
Get all the treasures

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,170
while laughing out loud.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,570
Give them all out at a big party

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,310

{\an5}Adventure on the Ghost Island and
the Famous Doctor Hogback!

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,790
What is a ghost island, anyway?

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,790
Hey...

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,030
Hey, where did that ghost from earlier go?

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,790
Is it still onboard?

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,800
No, it floated towards that island.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,350
It probably lives there.

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,980
Earlier there was a lot of shaking...

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,890
Perhaps it was the sound from that mouth-like gate closing?

47
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,030
I think we were "eaten" by that mouth.

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,360
Eaten?

49
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,450
It is difficult to tell with all this fog,

50
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,750
But it looks as if there's a fence that extends from the gate all the way around the island.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,340
Which means that we have been trapped inside that fence.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,340
Ghost Island
"Thriller Bark"

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,340
Current Location

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,340
"Mouth" Gate

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,770
Oh yeah!

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,300
That must be why that skeleton told us to hurry and get out of here!

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,370
That would mean that somebody made this into a wandering island!

58
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,150
But why?

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,040
Whatever the reason, what matters is that we are in the middle of the ocean.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
We can not drop anchor here.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Hey hey, why are you talking about stopping?!

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,410
We need to leave now, before we're cursed!

63
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,600
Listen, everyone...

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,850
I think I have the "I can not go on that island" disease.

65
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,610
Me too!

66
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,680
I have that too!

67
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,300
Alright!

68
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
Then you guys can stay here!

69
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,900
You have "all ready for adventure" disease?!

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,090
Reconsider it!

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,410
Luffy, take a good look!

72
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,710
That creepy building over there...

73
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,550
That is a real haunted house!

74
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,550
You're underestimating...

75
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,750
Evil spirits.

76
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,970
What're you talking about?

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,760
I am gonna be as careful as I can!

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,630
I will catch that ghost from before and keep it as a pet!

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,590
Way underestimating!

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,070
But anyway, we have got to get back
our precious crewmate.

81
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,760
Sanji, pirate lunch box!

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,090
Crewmate?

83
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,570
I am against that!

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,840
If you let that skeleton come with us, I will be too scared to sleep at night!

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,860
I have the lunch.

86
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,730
Luffy, Franky.

87
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,810
You two take good care of Robin-chan.

88
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,610
Going to explore an unknown island just gives me the chills.

89
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,700
You're kidding me!

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,820
Robin's going too?!

91
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,450
I love thrills.

92
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,700
Alright!

93
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,520
Alright you guys, we're gonna have to take a boat out to the island.

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,100
But you guys still haven't seen my present.

95
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,360
Soldier Dock System Channel Two.

96
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,920
Two?

97
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,570
This system has five channels.

98
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,090
There are two zeros, and then,

99
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,660
One,

100
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,050
Two,

101
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,700
Three,

102
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,810
Four.

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,090
Each one has its own specialized use.

104
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,430
Hold on.

105
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,750
We've already seen Zero's paddles, along with Docks One and Three.

106
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,850
But you said Two and Four were empty!

107
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,780
I told you that 'cuz it's a present!

108
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,830
The guys who aren't going to the island can test it out first.

109
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,240
Soldier Dock System Channel Two!

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,970
Here it is!

111
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,090
What is it?

112
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,480
What is going to come out?

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,110
The steam-powered...

114
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,120
Paddleship!

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,020
The shopping boat,

116
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,050
Mini Merry #2!

117
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,850
It is Merry!

118
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,570
Merry came back to us!

119
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,290
It's kinda small, but now we can ride Merry again!

120
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
I can't believe he had such a great present...

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Thank you, Franky!

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,810
If that's our shopping boat, I'd go shopping any time!

123
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,570
It's my turn! Hurry up, it's my turn!

124
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,240
That's really great.

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,860
Just hold on Straw Hat,

126
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,360
We'll ride it here soon.

127
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,100
Let them have fun with it for now.

128
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,290
Is that all of them, Franky?

129
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,410
Yeah.

130
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,620
Combined with One and Three, which you saw earlier, this is all of 'em!

131
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,430
Channel Zero - Support Paddle!

132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,860
Channel One, a waver that can hold one person - White Wooden Horse #1!

133
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,330
Channel Two, a shopping boat that can hold four people - Mini Merry #2!

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,340
Channel Three, a scouting submarine that can hold three people - Shark Submerge #3!

135
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,310
Right now, that is the whole Soldier Dock System.

136
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,320
Just think of them as soldiers helping out Thousand Sunny.

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,340
I really like the way you think, Franky!

138
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,450
You! You! You!

139
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,330
Yeah, I am just really great this week too...

140
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,060
Super!

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,050
Nami-san!

142
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,250
Nami-san!

143
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,290
What's wrong?

144
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,060
Did something happen?

145
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,170
What're they up to?

146
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,680
I can't see anything with this fog.

147
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,060
It came from the direction of the island.

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,830
You guys!

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,940
Hurry and let me ride on Mini Merry too!

150
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,650
Bastard, you need to worry about Nami-san's safety!

151
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,110
And you need to worry about the other two's safety too.

152
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,880
Perhaps she screamed as she was cursed by a ghost?

153
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,930
Stop that, it's not funny.

154
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,640
What?

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,940
Nobody was touching the anchor...

156
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,360
It's still brand new, so the gears shouldn't be that worn out yet...

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,550
Hurry and bring it up, the ship's gonna overbalance!

158
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,940
What?

159
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,390
Did someone do that?

160
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,760
No.

161
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,440
Nobody's close enough.

162
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,620
Luffy!

163
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,080
What are you doing?

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,850
Stop screwing around at a time like this!

165
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,440
Nyo, yats not ish!

166
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,440
{\an8}No, that's not it!

167
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,660
Yaim noi joing anyjing!

168
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,660
{\an8}I'm not doing anything!

169
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,130
Look out, Straw Hat!

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,210
Hey, bastard!

171
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,400
What the hell was that for?!

172
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,160
Sorry, my sword just did that...

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,680
This is weird...

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,570
With the exception of us... on this deck...

175
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,440
There's something else.

176
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,060
Maybe a ghost did it?

177
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,280
Or a devil fruit user, or somethin' like that?

178
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,290
Yeah, it felt like someone was grabbing me.

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,660
I heard the growl of a wild beast.

180
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,760
A beast?

181
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,120
Anyway, I'm worried about Nami-san!

182
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,760
You guys take care of the ship!

183
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm gonna go save those guys!

184
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,410
So uncool!

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
Woah, Sanji's floating!

186
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
How is that possible?!

187
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,830
You made a "hogeh"-noise.

188
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,780
Shut up, you!

189
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,020
You would've done the same!

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,580
We can't even leave the ship?

191
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,440
What are they trying to do?

192
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,560
If they wanted us dead, they could've done that by now...

193
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,260
What's wrong, Robin-chan?

194
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,810
Something's... grabbing me...

195
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,870
How dare you do something like that!

196
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,490
Robin-chan!

197
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,780
There really is an animal!

198
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,490
What now?

199
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,550
Look!

200
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,760
A wave!

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,790
It has gotta be some sort of artificial one to be inside this fence!

202
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,350
The ship's gonna capsize!

203
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,480
Robin-chan, is it gone?

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm fine, I think it left.

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,460
Hey, Hogeh, raise the anchor, or we're gonna sink!

206
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,800
Who the hell is "Hogeh"?!

207
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,180
Usopp! Chopper!

208
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,730
Can you hear us?

209
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,450
Damn, we're gonna be seperated from Nami-san.

210
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,660
Hey Franky!

211
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,740
Do something with the secret weapon!

212
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,080
Alright, I've got the "Flying Surprise Pool" we can use!

213
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,180
That sounds fun!

214
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
You idiot!

215
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,570
O-Ouch!

216
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,320
Of course you're hurt.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,980
We must've fallen down here.

218
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,330
Where are we?

219
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,420
We're on the ghost island.

220
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,770
Ghost!

221
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,940
Oh, stop that!

222
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,740
You don't need to be scared!

223
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,230
But just what happened to us?

224
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,100
We were having so much fun on Mini Merry that we accidentally hit the bank.

225
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,220
We were distracted and couldn't see in the fog...

226
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,070
All three of us were sent flying...

227
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,380
And in the blink of an eye, we were here.

228
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,480
It's 100% my fault, but...

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,370
You'll forgive me since I'm cute, right?

230
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll get you for this!

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm very sorry.

232
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,760
But anyway, it's weird that just after getting to this island there's a huge ditch!

233
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,200
It's probably to catch their enemies.

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,230
We're just lucky it wasn't filled with spikes.

235
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,780
Yeah,

236
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,480
We're safe 'cuz we landed on these skeletons.

237
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,460
I told you to stop!

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,740
But this must be the entrance.

239
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,610
If we just wait here, Luffy will find us.

240
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,820
But we're lower than sea level, that's kinda scary.

241
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah, it's dangerous, and they might not be able to see us here.

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,990
So should we wait on the bank above?

243
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,760
The bank?

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,900
But I don't know which way...

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,170
What's that?

246
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,860
A dog?

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,780
That's not a dog...

248
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,250
Then... then what is it?

249
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,260
That... it can't be...

250
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,550
Ce... Ce...

251
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,090
Cerberus!

252
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,350
It's Cerberus!

253
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,640
W-What is Cerberus?

254
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,220
It's the guard dog of hell!

255
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,760
It really exists?!

256
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,920
It must, it's right behind us!

257
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,870
So this is hell?!

258
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,020
We're in hell!

259
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,640
Just keep running!

260
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,160
If it catches us, it'll eat us!

261
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,780
Hey, what is it, Chopper?

262
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,230
Chopper, what do you see?

263
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,430
"Kon"...?

264
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,500
Hey, look at it carefully!

265
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,550
Isn't one of them a fox?!

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,140
Now it's saying "gon"!

267
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,860
It really didn't like it!

268
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,770
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

269
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,530
Look, stairs!

270
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,450
We can leave that way!

271
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,100
Thank god!

272
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,010
Does it have a bad sense of smell, even though it's a dog?

273
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,490
It left...

274
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,880
What now?

275
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,450
We ended up in a forest...

276
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,600
If that thing's walking around, then if we're anywhere not hidden we're in danger...

277
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,230
You are correct, sir.

278
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,410
Who are you?!

279
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,170
I am known as Hildon.

280
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,850
I saw that you all were being chased by the guard dog,

281
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,060
So I followed you in secret, in case you had trouble.

282
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,250
It will be night soon, after all.

283
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,970
This forest will become incredibly dangerous to those like yourselves who are unfamiliar with it.

284
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,450
So if you wish, I can take you to our mansion.

285
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,560
Mansion?

286
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,920
Yes...

287
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,620
Doctor Hogback-sama's mansion.

288
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
What is it?

289
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,560
What's wrong, Chopper?

290
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,650
Hogback?

291
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,060
Hey...

292
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,670
I couldn't see the horses very well through the fog, but...

293
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,010
Is there something wrong with them?

294
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,660
Oh, it's only your imagination.

295
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,020
That... that's alright then...

296
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,140
Anyway, you saved us.

297
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,130
Thanks, we were in trouble.

298
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,490
Oh no, it's my pleasure.

299
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,220
Would you like a drink?

300
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,830
This forest is full of odd animals, so walking through it is dangerous.

301
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,870
Yeah, I was pretty surprised.

302
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,570
I thought Cerberus was just a made-up creature.

303
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,730
It looked like a mutant or something.

304
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,680
I was wondering if we'd ever be able to get down from that tree.

305
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,320
If you're waiting for others, the mansion is ideal.

306
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,430
It's very visible, and very safe.

307
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,190
And we'll also be able to meet Doctor Hogback.

308
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,610
Is he really that famous?

309
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,650
Every doctor's heard of him.

310
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,330
He's a surgical genius!

311
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,430
With his miraculous operations, he's saved countless numbers of people!

312
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,350
He has all the status and honor a doctor can get,

313
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,230
And he's respected by doctors everywhere!

314
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,040
But one day,

315
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,210
he suddenly disappeared.

316
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,450
There were rumors that he had been abducted,

317
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,450
and the doctors of the world were all in an uproar.

318
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,110
But after years went by without a trace,
Hogback's name is now simply a legend...

319
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,560
That Doctor Hogback?!

320
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,700
Yes, even now the Doctor is researching new things.

321
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,870
I hope I can get an autograph!

322
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,210
I'm sure we can arrange it.

323
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,710
No way...

324
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,220
There are even lions in this forest?

325
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,180
What was that for?!

326
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Don't scare me like that!

327
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,430
What's wrong?

328
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,650
W-Well, just now, there was a l-lion...

329
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,640
Like this.

330
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah, right!

331
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
Then, take a look for yourself!

332
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,100
See?

333
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,550
Food, food, food!

334
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,590
Something's there!

335
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,210
Something's definitely there!

336
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,250
Wait up a sec!

337
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,010
Please stop the cart, Hildon-san!

338
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,690
Why are you so upset?

339
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,130
Perhaps you were just seeing things?

340
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,780
No, she wasn't!

341
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,350
There's something out there!

342
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,140
This forest is too weird!

343
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,890
Yes, it is a strange forest.

344
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,940
And, due to the thick fog and people's paranoia, {depending on whether there's a pause at the beginning, the comma should be kept or removed}

345
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,430
many people believe they see things out here.

346
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,770
So, it wasn't real? {remove the comma?}

347
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,600
That's good...

348
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,850
No, wait...

349
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,050
An illusion?

350
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,840
No, it was way too clear!

351
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,550
Hildon-san,

352
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,890
I'm sorry, but could you just bring us to the coast?

353
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,360
I know it's dangerous, but we can handle it.

354
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,400
But then I can't meet Doctor Hogback! {once again, watch out for pauses on the first comma}

355
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,430
I wanna meet him!

356
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,100
No, no, I know how you feel.

357
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,430
But this time we gotta rely on our special ability, the "something's fishy here” sensor!

358
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,720
Would you die to meet that doctor...

359
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,380
Would you survive and not meet him so you can leave the island...

360
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,680
Which do you pick?

361
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,370
Well, I don't wanna die.

362
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,040
I'm too scared.

363
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,460
Oh, is that so?

364
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,820
If that is what you wish...

365
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,710
Everyone, please wait here.

366
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,480
Stop the cart!

367
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,520
Sorry for taking away your chance, Chopper...

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,020
It's okay, I'm just no good at running off and doing my own thing like Luffy does...

369
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,300
10 minutes later...

370
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,300
Silence...

371
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,800
That's weird, all he was doing was turning it...

372
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,410
There's nobody there!

373
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,090
The horses are gone too!

374
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,060
We're all alone in the middle of a graveyard!

375
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,830
What?!

376
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,530
How?

377
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,120
He abandoned us?

378
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,470
M-Maybe he just went to the bathroom!

379
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,460
Hildon!

380
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,340
Hey, where'd you go?

381
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,450
But why a graveyard, of all places?

382
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,650
What?

383
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,940
No... no way!

384
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,540
Zo...

385
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,560
Zombies!

386
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,500
Ow, ow!

387
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,300
Usopp!

388
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,170
They're gonna tip the cart!

389
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,000
These guys're really strong!

390
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,860
He bit me!

391
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,390
Dammit, he bit me!

392
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,340
Now I'm gonna turn into a zombie!

393
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,220
Usopp!

394
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,830
I'll save you!

395
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,650
No, don't!

396
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,370
Stop!

397
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,420
Save me!

398
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,240
Let Usopp go!

399
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,260
Bastard!

400
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
I'm sorry!

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,730
Hey, you dropped this.

402
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,680
Thanks.

403
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,310
Save me!

404
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,030
They're gonna bite me!

405
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Nami!

406
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Let go...

407
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
Stay back!

408
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,640
A zombie's weakness is...

409
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,780
Deadly...

410
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,830
Flame Star!

411
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,690
Fire!

412
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,240
Careful, you'll burn up!

413
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,250
It worked a lot better than I'd thought...

414
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,940
How dare you do that to us, bastard!

415
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,980
What would you've done if you'd hit us, idiot?!

416
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,220
You rotten person!

417
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,560
But now the zombies are really mad!

418
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,650
Let's go, Nami!

419
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,300
Let’s get away now!

420
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,820
Now that we're this far, it's closest to just run to the mansion!

421
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,440
Yeah, let's do that!

422
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,470
That was scary...

423
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
It's alright!

424
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,610
Once we get out of the graveyard, we'll be fine if we run as fast as we can!

425
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,940
All zombies can do is groan and walk really slowly!

426
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
Slowly, slowly!

427
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,740
Wait, you bastard!

428
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,450
They're fast!

429
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,460
I'm tired...

430
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,530
They have no stamina!

431
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,640
I think... we lost them...

432
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,740
What is wrong with this island?

433
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,110
It's just covered with things that shouldn't be alive...

434
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,960
Hey, guys...

435
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,780
If I turn into a zombie, then you can just-

436
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,080
What are you talking about?

437
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,190
I read it in a book on zombies I found in Sunny's library.

438
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,330
For being scared of these things, you sure read a lot about them.

439
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,490
Well, here we are.

440
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,470
I just want a glass of water.

441
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,360
I can finally meet him!

442
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,240
This is great!

443
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,530
I bet that on an island like this...

444
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,740
You can't find a single honest person living on it.

445
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,420
Excuse us!

446
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,900
Is this Mr. Doctor Hogback's mansion?
