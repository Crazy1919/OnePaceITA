00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,880
Let's pile up all the dreams,

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,390
And go find the thing we're looking for... One Piece!

3
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,690
Compasses and the like will only slow us down

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,870
Isn't a legend if it's been proved real!

And pretend that it isn't there!

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,390
Let's pile up all the dreams,

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,690
and go find the thing we're looking for...

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,940
A pocket of coins, and

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,050
We are!

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,630
Let's break the tight-fisted night!

21
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,170
We have no interest in treasure chests

22
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,640
A pocket of romance, and

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,580
We are!

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,600
Let's pile up all the dreams,

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,260
And go find the thing we're looking for...

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,300
A pocket of coins, and

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,640
We are!

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,180
We are!

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,860
We are!

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,280
{\an5}Morning Comes!
The Straw Hats' Ultimate Attack!

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,810
Amazing, Straw Hat!

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,020
You defeated Oars!

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,920
Hey, Luffy! Hang in there!

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,770
Luffy!

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,990
We pushed him this far... Is he gonna be alright?

36
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,060
He must be completely worn out.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,560
He was using the strength of 100 men in a single body.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,450
Anyway, we gotta recover the shadows of all the victims quickly!

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,140
That's right!

40
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,200
Let's hurry!

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,340
The sky is getting brighter in the east.

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,610
It'll be morning any time now.

43
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,110
By the way, how do you get the shadows back?

44
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,230
4 of our friends were stripped off their shadows too.

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,050
That's another problem.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,160
To tell you the truth, we wanted
Straw Hat to do that for us, but...

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,120
That'd be impossible, he can't even move right now.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,430
Only Moriah, the master of all the shadows the zombies possess, is able to do that.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Unless he gives the "go back to your original master" order, the shadows won't return.

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,020
Let's quit the chit-chat and do it.

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,900
That's right!

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,240
We'll wake Moriah and force him to give the order.

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,650
If we don't recover the shadows, then there was no point in beating him!

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,870
O-Oars is back on his feet!

55
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,470
I thought that attack alone was enough to leave him unconscious!

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,940
This is terrible...

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,500
It's all over.

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,710
The entire Straw Hat crew is unconscious right now.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,560
We've already used all the shadows we had.

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,380
We don't have anything left to defeat him with.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,640
It doesn't hurt at all.

62
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,120
Damn it!

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,120
It seems we were no match for the power of a zombie after all!

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,810
We have no time left.

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,410
Dawn is almost upon us.

66
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,080
We'll never be freed from dwelling in darkness!

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,580
Let's give up.

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,800
We'll only find death if we stay here.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,670
Let's go back to the forest.

70
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,650
Let's return... to that gloomy forest where no light can be seen.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,570
You!

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,370
I don't know what happened to Luffy, but...

73
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,020
We have the upper hand right now.

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,620
H-Hey! Wait a minute, you!

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,430
If you move in that state you'll die!

76
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,140
He received the attack of that monster... How come he's still standing?!

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,730
I can't tell which one is the zombie here!

78
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,620
Hey, where did the Straw Hats we rescued go?

79
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,020
Don't ask me!

80
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,710
They couldn't have moved while being unconscious!

81
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,940
Huh, where are the other two?

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,030
Y-You're right!

83
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,320
The Long-nose and the woman are both gone.

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,230
Did they... go ahead and run off?

85
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,130
Huh, all of them?!

86
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,060
When did they...?

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,160
I-It seems it wasn't good enough.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,470
Huh, Straw Hat!

89
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,580
Hey, hey, even you, Straw Hat.

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,190
I just need to give him another shot.

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,500
Damn!

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,810
I'm still worn out from before.

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,310
Robin!

94
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,980
Yeah.

95
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,250
I'm right here.

96
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,750
They didn't run!

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I need to get up there.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,210
Roger.

99
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,840
Then... I'll make you a foothold.

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,570
If there's anything I can assist you with...

101
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,860
Even the one reduced to bones is moving!

102
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,950
Why?!

103
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,070
Alright, Brook, I have a request!

104
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,400
I knew this would happen!

105
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,370
Everyone's ready to give you their support!

106
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,200
The girl from before!

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,540
Why's she there?!

108
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,060
Don't tell me these guys...!

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,400
Didn't intend to escape at all!

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,670
From the very moment Oars stood up...

111
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,960
They began to plan their counterattack!

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,430
Just watch.

113
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,640
Chopper, hurry up!

114
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
The sun is about to rise!

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,420
Yeah!

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,190
Is this what you needed, Franky?

117
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,770
That's enough, now give me a hand!

118
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,740
I can't believe it!

119
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,770
These guys never intended to give up!

120
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,830
Hey, you're in the way!

121
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,560
Step aside!

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,600
As you order!

123
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
Pierna Fleur...

124
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
{\an8}Leg Flower

125
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900
Here we go!

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,730
Got it!

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
Wait!

128
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,970
Where are you going?

129
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,550
What's this?

130
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,910
Smoke? Clouds?

131
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,380
The forecast is rain.

132
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,610
Coolball!

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,100
Rain Tempo!

134
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,440
It's raining! How come?!

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,740
Is that girl a magician?

136
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,540
Alright!

137
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,080
The emergency pipe is complete!

138
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,170
Damn.

139
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,900
Coup de Vent!

140
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,240
What the...?!

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,570
Spin with all your strength!

142
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm on it!

143
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,830
Here goes!

144
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,090
Ultra Refrigerator Super Freezing Cannon...

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,160
Fire!

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,820
I'm frozen!

147
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,320
I can't move!

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,360
Amazing!

149
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,220
They used it to freeze the rain!

150
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,650
This time it's my turn!

151
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,950
Go!

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,700
A chain?!

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,010
Alright!

154
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,660
The rudder's chain?!

155
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,430
You're amazing, Sanji!

156
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,780
It was nothing!

157
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,600
Throw me!

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,250
Are you sure about this?!

159
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,420
I'll be fine, I'm a rubberman after all!

160
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,390
Be careful!

161
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,980
Gear Third!

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,220
Bone Balloon!

163
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,620
Zoro!

164
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,220
Take care of Oars' stomach!

165
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,520
Leave it to me!

166
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,220
Three Swords Style...

167
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,000
Secret Technique...

168
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,120
Three Thousand Worlds!

169
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,900
Now!

170
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,040
There you go!

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,660
Well done, Sanji!

172
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,770
Oars' spine is completely straight now!

173
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,620
What're they doing?!

174
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,310
The human spine is S-shaped in order to
alleviate the effects of shocks and weight.

175
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:22,600
If it's straightened out, the force isn't migitated, and all the damage is taken.

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,390
Go, Luffy!

177
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,440
Good luck to you!

178
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,910
I'll give you an extra-large bazooka!

179
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,120
Then, I'll counter it with my own bazooka!

180
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,870
Rubber...

181
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,450
Huh? It won't move!

182
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,070
My right arm won't move!

183
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,550
It won't stretch either!

184
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,240
The absence of pain is the zombie's greatest disadvantage.

185
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,620
He's your shadow...

186
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,930
Finish him off, Luffy.

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,130
Rubber...

188
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,160
Go!

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,770
Take him down, Straw Hat!

190
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,330
Heads up!

191
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,010
Giant...

192
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,140
Bazooka!

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,580
He did it!

194
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,840
No matter what kind of zombie he is, he can't possibly get up after that.

195
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Oars lost.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
And this time for good.

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,580
What's gonna happen to Thriller Bark?

198
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,770
They did it.

199
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,730
They're quite something.

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,300
It seems I brought some dangerous fellas...

201
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,840
What happened?!

202
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,610
Where's our Master?!

203
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,880
He won!

204
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,160
This time he really did it!

205
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,450
He won!

206
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,900
Thanks a lot!

207
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,710
You're the best!

208
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,990
As expected from our ray of hope!

209
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,920
This man lived up to our expectations after all!

210
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,270
Where's Straw Hat?

211
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,250
A midget!

212
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,960
Who're you?!

213
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,460
Why did you shrink?!

214
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,570
It doesn't hurt, and yet, I can't move.

215
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,040
He's still awake, despite having his bones pulverized.

216
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,430
How much more can this power make fun of life.

217
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,880
The morning sun.

218
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,160
Why?

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,170
What's this unease I feel...?

220
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,640
Hey, Luffy!

221
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,070
Get your shadow back, quickly!

222
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,240
There's no time to celebrate!

223
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,500
Everyone here might disappear!

224
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,530
The shadows!

225
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,950
He's right! We gotta hurry!

226
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,350
Now, punch that Moriah awake and
make him return all of our shadows!

227
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,050
The morning sun has almost risen!

228
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,370
There's no need...

229
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,860
to punch me awake.

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,210
Moriah!

231
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Master!

232
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,850
I'm glad you're alright!

233
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,210
Moriah-sama would never fall that easily!

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,530
I-It is better now that you're awake!

235
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:01,660
Now... if you don't wanna get beaten by the Straw Hats again, you better release all of our shadows!

236
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,820
Yes, give 'em back, you bastard!

237
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,490
This isn't a child's game.

238
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,900
A true pirate can't be threatened with that!

239
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,780
If you dogs of the forest were behind this,

240
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,940
That solves the mystery of
Straw Hat's excessive power-up!

241
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,180
It's disturbing to think that
you took advantage of my shadow ability!

242
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,980
Shut up!

243
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,450
Give back the shadows!

244
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,690
Straw Hat, how dare you destroy my Thriller Bark!?

245
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,180
You were the one who messed with our trip!

246
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,590
Give back our shadows before the sun rises!

247
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,940
Had you continued on your travels in your
current state, you would have only found death!

248
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,700
You wouldn't have lasted a minute in the New World!

249
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,770
You've gathered some impressive subordinates, but...

250
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,390
you will lose them all!

251
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,800
Do you know why?!

252
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,110
Hey, Straw Hat, this isn't the time to chat!

253
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,530
Look at the sky!

254
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,040
It's getting brighter!

255
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,100
Hurry up and retrieve the shadows!

256
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,390
There's no time left!

257
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,880
I found the answer from personal experience!

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,730
Why did I lose all my skilled subordinates after they made a reputation for themselves!?

259
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,630
I lost my companions because they were alive!

260
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,680
If they're undead zombies from the very start, then you won't lose them!

261
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,340
Zombies are immortal!

262
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,980
An unlimited amount of soldiers who can be replaced at any time!

263
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll use this undead army to go after the title of Pirate King once more!

264
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,720
You should be grateful that I chose your shadows to become my subordinates!

265
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,580
Something's stuck to me!

266
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,730
Now!

267
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,410
Hear my words, shadows of Thriller Bark!

268
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,870
Become one with my power!

269
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,650
{\an8}Asgard: heavenly residence of the gods and slain heroes in Norse mythology

270
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,650
Shadows' Asgard!

271
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,970
Brother!

272
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
His shadow was taken.

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,610
The shadows are...!

274
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,740
No way!

275
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,210
He's gathering the shadows from the whole island and absorbing them!

276
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,780
Straw Hat!

277
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,480
You withstood 100 shadows, didn't you?!

278
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,620
Then, I can withstand...

279
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,950
200!

280
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,290
300!

281
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,180
600!

282
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,370
700!

283
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,510
1000 shadows!

284
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,630
It's all over.

285
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,680
What is that thing?

286
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,950
I'm back to normal.

287
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,400
It's nearly morning!

288
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Even Straw Hat couldn't defeat Oars with 100 shadows.

289
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,020
But 10 times that amount?

290
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,510
So the original user can withstand a much larger amount?!

291
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,770
W-We're done for!

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,400
What's gonna happen now?!

293
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,190
This can't be true!

294
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,480
He absorbed Straw Hat's shadow too.

295
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,890
Run!

296
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,950
We don't stand a chance!

297
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

298
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,320
He's breaking the island apart!

299
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,510
The mast-mansion is coming down!

300
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,160
Run!

301
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,470
Run into the forest!

302
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,740
This is really it!

303
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,010
I'm disappearing!

304
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,060
My body is disappearing!

305
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,930
Someone help me!

306
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,230
Fool! Hurry and get in the shade!

307
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,390
The sunlight is almost upon us!

308
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,900
Head to the forest through the shade!

309
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,700
Don't leave the mansion's shadow!

310
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,240
Captain Lola!

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,340
What're you doing?!

312
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,890
Hurry up!

313
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,300
You guys run.

314
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,090
What're you saying?!

315
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,040
You're coming with us!

316
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,230
I'm the one who’s responsible...

317
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,180
for this bet.

318
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,230
Look over there.

319
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,920
They...

320
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,010
Those guys...

321
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,100
They haven't moved an inch.

322
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,460
They were also stripped of their shadows.

323
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,790
No way!

324
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,380
They still think they can win?!

325
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,150
But he destroyed half of the island with a single blow.

326
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,870
Moriah's power exceeds that of Oars' right now!

327
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,560
Since they haven't given up yet...

328
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,550
I'm not moving from here.

329
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,860
If we keep calling them our "Ray of Hope" and then abandon them at the first sight of trouble,

330
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,830
we're nothing but a bunch of maggots.

331
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,520
But in our current situation...

332
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,170
You go ahead and escape.

333
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,500
As your Captain, I promise to uphold your honor.

334
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,090
You just... keep yourselves alive.

335
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,420
Captain Lola!

336
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,130
The light is reaching you!

337
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,240
Hurry and get in the shade!

338
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,400
It's okay!

339
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,380
This is what it means to place your hopes in other people!

340
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,800
Captain Lola!

341
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,870
No way.

342
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,290
Do you wanna die?!

343
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,660
Life or death. There's just one answer!

344
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,260
I don't care which one it is.

345
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,330
I'm not going back to the darkness!

346
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
Captain!

347
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,020
This is going from bad to worse.

348
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,810
He's completely lost it.

349
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,750
His rage and foolish pride are fueling his madness.

350
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Hey, everyone, we're out of time.

351
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,450
This will be a bit reckless.

352
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,380
Alright! We're counting on you!

353
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,920
Take him down!

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,310
Hey, you!

355
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,230
What hope could you possibly have?!

356
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,960
There's no way you can win!

357
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,660
The enemy is a monster of 1000 men!

358
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,210
That's right!

359
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,580
Think this over!

360
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,870
He absorbed all of your shadows!

361
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,140
That monster is much more powerful than you!

362
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,600
Besides, we're out of time!

363
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,550
If you don't wanna get involved, just watch from there.

364
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,370
In this battle against Moriah, we already have the upper hand.

365
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,640
However,

366
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,910
winning before daybreak is a completely different matter.

367
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,180
Moriah has exceeded his limits in order to buy as much time as possible.

368
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,780
Gear Second!

369
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,890
Will we be destroyed first?

370
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,220
Or...

371
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,090
will Moriah destroy himself first?

372
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,990
Rubber...

373
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,030
Jet Rocket!

374
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,260
Look!

375
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,460
The shadows are coming out!

376
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,490
Jet Bazooka!

377
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,460
Jet Bazooka!

378
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,320
It's one after another!

379
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,010
Aren't those shadows supposed to be under his command?!

380
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,860
Moriah's control worsens as he loses consciousness!

381
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,220
Even for Moriah, it's impossible to handle 1000 shadows!

382
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,630
Rubber...

383
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,810
Brick Bat!

384
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,440
Black Box!

385
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,990
I'm trapped!

386
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,920
Disappear!

387
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,730
A direct hit!

388
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,960
The punch that divided the island!

389
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,450
Straw Hat!

390
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,240
Stop!

391
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,330
This is your baptism!

392
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,670
This is what happens to amateurs like you who try to act big in this sea!

393
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,840
This is what happens when you mess with a Warlord of the Sea!

394
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,710
Learn your place in this world!

395
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,520
A nail that sticks out will be hammered back into line!

396
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,480
Luffy-san!

397
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,590
Luffy!

398
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,670
He's back on his feet!

399
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,510
I don't care if I'm an amateur...

400
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,580
or if I'm sticking out...

401
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,480
No one...

402
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,410
can...

403
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,050
crush me!

404
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,130
No one can crush you?

405
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,060
The simple fact you make such baseless statements...

406
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,760
Shows how inexperienced you a-

407
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,060
Because I'm made of rubber.

408
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,740
I'll make you spit out all of the shadows!

409
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,680
What is he?

410
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,540
Is he immortal?!

411
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,880
Amazing!

412
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,060
Sunlight!

413
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,250
Damn it!

414
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,280
Fools! Go back to the shade!

415
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,200
You'll end up disappearing!

416
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Help me!

417
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,850
My hand... is disintegrating!

418
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,790
Get in the shade!

419
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,260
This whole place is a dead zone!

420
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,570
Bone Balloon!

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,410
Hey! Is it okay to use that technique too?!

422
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,720
There's no way!

423
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,010
Did you forget that Second alone wears out your body?!

424
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,110
Don't be reckless, Luffy!

425
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
Your body... will be torn apart!

426
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,570
Rubber...

427
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,860
Giant...

428
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,710
Jet Shell!

429
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,770
So powerful!

430
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,500
The shadows are coming out!

431
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,470
I won't let... my army get away!

432
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,830
Shadows!

433
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,230
I am your master!

434
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,720
That bastard!

435
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,620
He's not letting the shadows get away!

436
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,390
My shadow!

437
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,390
Come back to me!

438
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,330
Captain Lola!

439
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,630
Captain Lola!

440
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,940
Can you hear me, shadow?!

441
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,840
We've been together ever since we were born!

442
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,080
We were born in this world together!

443
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,610
Please come back!

444
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,090
For three long years, I kept looking for the zombie in which you were trapped!

445
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,520
And now you're right before me, aren't you?!

446
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,220
If you can hear me, please come back!

447
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,360
Please come back!

448
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,700
Captain Lola!

449
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,660
Please take cover in the wall's shade already!

450
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,860
Your body could disappear!

451
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,820
But... it's awful.

452
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,370
Just when I've finally found it!

453
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,570
Indeed.

454
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,310
Right now, all of our shadows must be inside Moriah!

455
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,350
We're never gonna get a chance like this again!

456
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,650
Unfortunately, the enemy is a Warlord of the Sea.

457
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,390
Yes, come back!

458
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,090
Come back to me, shadow!

459
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,660
Come back!

460
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,360
Come back!

461
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,290
Come back!

462
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,320
Come back!

463
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,070
I also have something to say to my shadow.

464
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,510
If you're so eager to be the Pirate King...

465
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,180
Hurry up and...

466
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,180
Come back to me!

467
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,450
Straw Hat, why you!

468
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,080
You bastard!

469
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,620
You will see...

470
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,460
In the New World... you will face the real nightmares!

471
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,140
In the New World...!

472
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,070
The shadows are returning!

473
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,760
H-Hey, everyone!

474
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,290
Hey!

475
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,310
Shadow! Quickly...!

476
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,160
Too late!
