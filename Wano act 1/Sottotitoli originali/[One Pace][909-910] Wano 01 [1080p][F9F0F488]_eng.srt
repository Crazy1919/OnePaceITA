1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,430
New World

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,240
Minks' Guardians

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,240
Master Nekomamushi is quite a skilled navigator!{\an8}

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,790
I'd expected no less from a man
who sailed with the pirate king!

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,460
Now, how much longer do we
have to wait by these ruins?

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,840
Until Master Nekomamushi returns with Marco!

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,710
I wonder if he'll come...

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,220
If Marco accompanies us to Wano,
he'll make for a strong ally.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,780
After all, he's the First Division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates!

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,970
He's known as Marco the Phoenix!

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,850
I couldn't believe
he's Master's friend!

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,060
All right!

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm gonna get a look at that man for myself.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,530
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait!

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,410
Master told you to wait here
because you-gara have a scary face!

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,200
Hmph! Is he the kind of guy
who'd get scared by my face?!

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,960
That's not the point.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,770
He said there is a peaceful village on the other side of the cave behind the waterfall...

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,840
A group of warriors like us
would terrify the locals.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,210
True.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,850
But Master Nekomamushi's
face is scarier than mine!

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,510
Yeah, when he gets mad.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,270
– But he's cute when he smiles.
– For sure!

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:31,200
Onward to Wano

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,530
There!

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,120
Hey, wait!

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,030
Okay.

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,810
His treatment is complete.
He can go now-yoi.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,650
He said you're better.
 Can you stand, Tama?

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,810
Take your time.

31
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,910
My Flames of Restoration can only help others so much.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,750
Marco
Former First Division Commander (Ship's Doctor)
Whitebeard Pirates

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,310
With this treatment, he should heal faster.

34
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,750
He'll be jumping around by tomorrow.

35
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,440
Wow! Marco is magic!

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,250
Isn't it great, Tama!

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,180
Wow! That was amazing!

38
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,730
You're okay now, Tama!

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,620
I said, “By tomorrow”!
Don't jump around now!

40
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,910
Thanks, Marco!

41
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,450
You're the best!

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,380
– Marco...
 – Marco-san...

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,880
I've got a stiff neck...

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
Nekomamushi
Mink Tribe Guardians

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,420
Marco, at the mountain...

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,090
Marco, our crops...

47
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,930
Marco, my back hurts again!

48
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,970
– Marco-chan, my knees...
– Marco, can you help me study?

49
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,180
Marco, my brother is such a meanie!

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,150
All right-yoi.
I'll hear you out one by one-yoi.

51
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,840
This is the village Pops built-yoi...

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Old man Whitebeard?
What do you mean?

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,550
Due to the extreme poverty in this area,

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,430
people here can't afford to pay the heavenly tribute
and join the World Government...

55
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,190
That's how it goes with
non-member nations.

56
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,480
Pirates and human traffickers can roam freely on these lawless islands.

57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,710
They end up in ruins,
and more kids become unhappy orphans...

58
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,810
Pops was one of those kids-yoi.

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,320
He set out to sea at an early age.

60
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,840
Even after he became a pirate,
he still cared about this island...

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,040
He kept his identity a secret while funneling his dirty money and resources here...

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
for the rest of his life.

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,120
He didn't have a family back then,
and all his friends were gone,

64
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,190
but this was his home.

65
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,740
In this corrupt world,
there's no such thing as clean money!

66
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,260
Thank you-yoi...

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,910
After the Summit War,

68
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,400
we wanted to at least protect the things that were important to Pops.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,130
So when Blackbeard came to invade our territory, the Payback War started.

70
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,260
But we were no match for Teach
after he got Pops' fruit.

71
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,940
He took everything from us...

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,430
I wanted to beat the hell
out of that ingrate...

73
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,480
Pops was...

74
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,110
Pops was actually quite cheap.

75
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,500
He always wanted other people's drinks...

76
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,960
but he never treated us!

77
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,090
Since he was funneling
his share of the loot to this village...

78
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,960
We all knew, though!

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,690
I see...

80
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,860
So this village is like a memento
that he left behind.

81
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah...

82
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,740
And...

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Red Hair buried him nearby...

84
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,420
By the way,

85
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,690
did you hear about that warlord, Weevil? He's claiming to be Pops' son...

86
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,300
and attacking people connected to Whitebeard.

87
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh yeah? Is it true?!

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,050
I don't know much about his love life,

89
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,130
but I guess Weevil's just after an inheritance.

90
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,510
I doubt they'll take my word
that there isn't anything left.

91
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,900
I figure that sooner or later he'll come after me and this place-yoi.

92
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,230
I see.

93
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,600
So you can't leave-meow.

94
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,980
Weevil's mother Bakkin used to be a pirate.

95
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,720
I know that 30 or 40 years ago,
she was on the same ship as Pops.

96
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,720
Then, maybe he's also a memento
that should be protected.

97
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,780
His behavior tells me otherwise-yoi!

98
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,180
You're right!

99
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,650
If you're going to see Straw Hat Luffy,
I want you to pass on a message, Nekomamushi.

100
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,110
Yeah, no problem.

101
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,160
– You said he's going to Wano, right?
– Yep.

102
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,860
What's his goal there?

103
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,120
To take down Kaido!

104
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,960
The emperor... Kaido?!

105
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,370
Luffy's looking to pick
a fight with Kaido?!

106
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,800
At Sea - The New World

107
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,560
Luffy! It says the Reverie has begun!

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,740
Monarchs from all over the world
are attending the conference at Mary Geoise!

109
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,970
Hmmm...

110
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,500
This time, all eyes are on the Ryugu Kingdom....

111
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,240
since they're participating for the
first time in two centuries!

112
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,220
Neptune-san and the brothers are there...

113
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,360
and it says that they were cheering for Shirahoshi at the Red Port!

114
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,990
So she came up to the surface!
 Weakhoshi is getting stronger!

115
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,220
Captain "Straw Hat" Luffy
Straw Hat Pirates
Bounty: 1.5 Billion Belly

116
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,120
It seems like your grandpa was their escort.{\an8}

117
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,220
Really?{\an8}

118
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,010
They took a big step towards their dream
to relocate the Fishmen to the surface!

119
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,310
Vivi-chwai!

120
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,780
You became an even more beautiful princess!

121
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,370
Who could it be for?

122
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,980
Me?! Hey, is it for me?!

123
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,520
You're in my way!

124
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,280
Vivi!

125
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,870
It's Vivi!

126
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,740
It's been forever since we last saw her!

127
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,170
She's even more graceful and regal!

128
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,490
Oh, so this is Vivi-san.

129
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,470
If I get to see her someday,
I'd like to see her panties...

130
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
Like she'd show you!

131
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,680
Oh, these are photos are from a party in the palace courtyard...

132
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,140
Look at all the royals who attended with their guards.

133
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,310
I-If Dressrosa is participating...

134
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,850
There she is! Viola-chan!

135
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,950
Ugh! It's Wapol!

136
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,040
The old acorn guy is there, too!

137
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,140
What? Wapol?! Did he make a comeback?!

138
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,080
Rebecca! Sai! We know so many of them!

139
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,290
Of course. Royals from all around the world gather
at the Reverie to discuss issues!

140
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,050
Oh, maybe at the Reverie...

141
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,310
At the Reverie, the princesses that I know...

142
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
are gathering to discuss me!

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,430
Wouldn't that be nice?

144
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,170
Hey, look at this, Chopper!

145
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,150
Right here!

146
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,190
What is it, Chobro?

147
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,000
Doctorine!

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,300
Oh, is she still alive?

149
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,330
Hey!

150
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,850
Doctorine...

151
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,010
Hey! What are you doing, Chopper?!

152
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,110
– Don't cut it out!
– Wait? What!

153
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,480
– Give me back my princesses!
– What are you doing?!

154
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,570
Hey! I haven't read the other side yet!
It's full of holes!

155
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,040
Oh? Is this an article about Kaido?

156
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,290
Big Mom... What?! I can't read it!

157
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,670
Sanji-kun! Chopper!
Give those back to me!

158
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,210
No!

159
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,150
I'm glad everyone is doing well!

160
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,280
Once we sail around the world,
let's visit them again!

161
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,920
Yes! All in good order!

162
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Anyway, Luffy-san, the transponder snail
still won't connect?

163
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Oh, I forgot.

164
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey! This is Luffy! Come in!

165
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,540
There's no response.

166
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,480
Whatever. Let's push on!

167
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,500
Wait, Luffy!

168
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,150
What's wrong?

169
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,210
The wind...

170
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,470
This cold wind... and I've never seen waves like this...

171
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,180
This can only mean trouble.

172
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,040
So this is the sea of Wano!

173
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,930
The wind is getting stronger as we draw closer,
and the waves are getting bigger!

174
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,810
It doesn't look like a normal wind-driven current.
The way it swells...

175
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,630
Plus it has that unusual current...

176
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,770
Look at the rough weather over there!

177
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,200
We wanna avoid a storm...
Shall we wait a little longer?

178
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey! What are you talking about, Brook?!
Let's go to Wano now!

179
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,480
Luffy-san, why do you always drag
your crew into such obvious danger?

180
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,910
Actually, Brook...

181
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,210
Kin'emon actually warned me about this...

182
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,720
I shall properly explain through this snail thing.

183
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,260
The entire sea surrounding Wano
is always subject to terrible weather.

184
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,190
The water is rough
and the current is strong,

185
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,160
so it is difficult to even enter the country!

186
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,990
What?! The weather is always this bad?!
Then should we just go?!

187
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,940
That's what I'm saying. Let's go!

188
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,060
Not only does it have strong samurai
but it's also so perilous to enter...

189
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,570
It truly is an isolated country!

190
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,880
Let me think a little...
There must be a way to get through safely...

191
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,810
– What's that thing?!
– It's an octopus!

192
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,100
A giant one!

193
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,730
Why's an octopus here?!

194
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,000
– We're at sea! Octopuses live here!
– I know that, but...

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,230
When did it come on board?!

196
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,240
Hey! We're getting closer to Wano!

197
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,660
What?!

198
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,280
Who cares?! Go, Sunny!

199
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,500
To Wano!

200
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,350
Hey! Something's getting closer!

201
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,260
What?! What is it?!

202
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,140
It looks like a giant fish!

203
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,520
– Is it a shark?!
– A shark?!

204
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,780
Oh no! It's coming!

205
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,140
K-Koi...

206
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,100
Oh my, oh my!

207
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,570
It's a massive koi!

208
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,220
It's a school of koi?!

209
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,810
Why are there koi in the sea?!

210
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,830
They're freshwater fish!
How can they survive here?!

211
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,830
That doesn't matter now!
They're more monster than fish anyway!

212
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,450
Hey, Sanji? Are they tasty?!

213
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,670
Forget about these monsters!

214
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,310
Well, soaking them in hot and cold water...

215
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,360
makes a delicious arai-style sashimi.

216
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,120
Or simmer it in miso for koikoku.

217
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,750
They're also good as tempura or as amani.

218
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,320
All right!

219
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,430
We'll have a feast ready
for our reunion with Zoro and the others!

220
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,210
– Don't, Luffy!
– Koi have a lot of tiny bones!

221
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,520
Who cares?!
That's not important now!

222
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,970
Don't fight back!

223
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,900
Of course, it's fighting back!
Why are you always like this?!

224
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Sanji-kun! You're also responsible for this!
Bring Luffy back!

225
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,310
Don't worry, Nami-san.
He'll be fine.

226
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,430
What?!

227
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,680
Instead, we should protect the ship!

228
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,240
The wind is strong!
Carrot, furl the sail!

229
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,570
– Okay!
– I'll help!

230
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,530
Look how clear the water is!
It's like the water of a mountain river!

231
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,350
I'd prefer it wasn't so clear!
The giant fish in the water scare me!

232
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,290
Wait, is this a river?!

233
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,850
Where are these koi heading?!

234
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,700
Hang on tight!
We're going with the flow!

235
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,430
Is Luffy still around here?!

236
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,580
What?!

237
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,620
Whoa-whoa, what is that?!

238
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,520
The river's flowing to the bottom of the waterfall!
How's that possible?!

239
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,910
I got it!

240
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,750
If this waterfall is the
reason that it's fresh water,

241
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,810
a massive spring should be up there!

242
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,030
Could Wano be up there?!

243
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,290
Up there...

244
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,700
What?! Whaaat?! How is that possible?!

245
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,300
Oh! Look at that!

246
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,890
– The koi are climbing up the waterfall!
– Why?!

247
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,010
Holy carp! Those koi are cool!

248
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,780
A sailing ship can't do that!
We'll sink under the waterfall!

249
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,570
Of course, we would!

250
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,520
Luffy!

251
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,000
Wow, those koi are so tough!

252
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,750
– This is no time for that!
– Luffy! She says this ship's gonna sink!

253
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,170
Okay, count on me!

254
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,420
What?!

255
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,900
Hang on tight!

256
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,580
I'm counting on you, koi!

257
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,890
You've got to be kidding!

258
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,270
Go!

259
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,750
All right!

260
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,300
Up we go!

261
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,650
What's wrong with the sea around Wano?!

262
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,120
It's so chaotic!

263
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,620
Hey! There's the shore!

264
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,750
It's a whirlpool!

265
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,200
Luffy! Let go of those koi!

266
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,070
No! They're my dinner!

267
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,070
Enough already!

268
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,410
Brook! Take the helm!

269
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,480
Okay!

270
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,320
It's no good! The current is too fast!

271
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,940
Damn! We're almost there!

272
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,760
We're not gonna make it this time!

273
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,470
Doctorine!

274
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,370
Hey? Where are my koi?

275
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,520
– That's not important now!
– What?

276
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh no! We're getting sucked in!

277
