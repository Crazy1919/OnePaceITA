00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,310
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,930
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,610
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,150
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,350
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,840
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,660
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,320
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,290
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,790
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,460
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,040
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,690
We... made it this far.

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,590
We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,670
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,270
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,270
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,690
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,210
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,580

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,670
Has Princess Shirahoshi still not sent a letter back?

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,170
Nah, not yet, Captain Decken.

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,130
Ah, how many years have I been waiting now?

50
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,260
About ten, right?  She's probably not gonna answer...

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,320
In short, this is all that despicable Neptune's fault!

52
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,110
He wants to force her into a political marriage...

53
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,610
I presume!

54
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,020
The fact that he's been keeping her locked inside that steel tower for 10 years proves it!

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,160
Oh, how tragic!

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,120
Despite the fact that she and I are in love...

{\an8}Princess Shirahoshi!

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:47,640
No matter how long I wander the ocean floor, I'll never find another woman as great or as beautiful as you!

62
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,600
If our love is mutual, then all is well.

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,000
However, I can not allow you to live with another man.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,230
If you do, then you must die, Shirahoshi!

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,090
It's either "Death or Marriage" for you! {Overly literal translations FTL.} {Gil: Fucking Engrish} {Death or Marriage / Dead or Marriage ? ugh.}

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,530
Today, I will once again send you an axe with the emblem of a single rose on it.

67
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,570
Accept it, Shirahoshi!
It is the symbol of our marriage!

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,460
Captain... You completely missed the target.

69
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,800
You imbecile!  I never miss my target...

70
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,260
I presume!

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,190
It came back!

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
It's flying toward Ryuuguu Palace!

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,040
Ryuuguu Kingdom  Royal Palace
Ryuuguu Palace

74
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,530
H-Hey!  What's wrong?!

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,390
I'm just a pirate who came here to get some food!

76
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,920
Come on!

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,230
Hey!

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,360
Oh, shut up... What a pain.

79
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,410
Princess Shirahoshi is crying!

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,300
It's coming from Hard-Shell Tower!

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,230
What happened to the tower's guards!?

82
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,090
What?!  Why is nobody with her?!

83
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,560
We're sorry, Sir!  There was a mix-up with the shifts.

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,320
A human has come to take my life,

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,420
and has made it inside my room!

86
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,800
Huh?  No!

87
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,810
Hey, that's not it!

88
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,790
I was just hungry, and didn't know this was your food!

89
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,600
An axe?  Where'd it come from?

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,300
Are you alright?

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,700
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?!

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,640
You were screaming louder than usual,
so we were worried.

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,610
What are you doin-

94
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,480
Is there an intruder in here?!

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,400
I-I'm sorry to have made you worry.  I must have had a nightmare.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,490
I could have sworn I heard a voice.

97
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,720
Well...

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,430
Oh, and speaking of which,
there is something I must tell you.

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,450
It's about the pirate Straw Hat Luffy,
who apparently rescued Megalo earlier.

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,790
Some mermaids have gone missing,
and we suspect he has kidnapped them.

101
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:40,370
Also, due to a prediction by Madame Shyarly, we've decided to confine the Straw Hats to the dungeon,

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,650
as there is a good chance that they will cause trouble in the future.

103
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,140
The swordsman who came
to Ryuuguu Palace a little while ago...

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,320
fell asleep after drinking too much,
and we have already placed him under arrest.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,860
The three members of Straw Hat's crew who arrived just now have probably been captured too.

106
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,410
However, their captain, Straw Hat, who came here with them must have realized what was going on...

107
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,650
and somehow, he's disappeared.

108
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,760
We believe he may be lurking
somewhere in the castle, so please be careful.

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,910
We will also make sure we capture
the rest of his crewmates on the island.

110
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,650
We will protect the country's peace at all costs!

111
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:30,560
Well, in any case, it's really quite a shame that we had to restrain Megalo's saviors.

112
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,670
Oh, right... It has already been five minutes.

113
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,900
We will be leaving now.

114
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Thank you so much.

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,840
I really was quite rude to you earlier.

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,910
Please, forgive me.

117
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,650
I didn't know you were the one who saved Megalo's life.

118
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,450
May I call you Luffy-sama?

119
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,220
Sure.

120
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,640
Luffy-sama, since you are a pirate...

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,880
does that mean you are a bad person?

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,980
I don't know.  Decide that for yourself.

123
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,860
B-But what about your crewmates?
They've been captured by our guards.

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,070
Oh, it's alright.  There's no way you guys could actually capture them.

125
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,510
Is that so?

126
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,620
Well, never mind that.  What was with that axe?

127
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,450
What kind of superman could have thrown that, and from where?

128
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,320
I know... who did it.

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,190
It's a man named Vander Decken-sama.

130
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,420
He did it to get revenge, since I refused to marry him.

131
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,310
That man...

132
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,350
The devil placed the curse of "Target" on him.

133
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,220
Because of this, he's capable of...

134
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,200
targeting my life from anywhere at any time,
since he has set me as his target.

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,850
That's why it's dangerous for me to go outside.

136
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm not even allowed to take a single step outside Hard-Shell Tower. { def: "single step"? maybe "set a single fin" }

137
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,960
He has been doing it for ten years.

138
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,630
Ten years?!

139
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,520
Must be really boring.

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,020
And on top of that, my father has decided that the guards can only be in here...

141
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,290
for five minutes at a time. {...WHY?! I mean, I get that he wants to protect her from the guy who can telekinetically throw giant axes at her, but why the hell is he also refusing to let her have more than five minutes of contact with other people at a time?!}  {To prevent the door for being opened for too long? -FAb} {Gil: Because one can't simply go in the room, close the door behind themselves, talk to her for however long they want, then leave and close the door on the way out... no... okay.}

142
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,200
Really?

143
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,210
And so, Megalo is the only one I can talk to.

144
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,350
He's a valuable friend of mine.

145
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,100
So that's why they wanted
to hold a feast just for saving him.

146
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,860
That kinda got ruined, though.

147
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:48,800
Regardless of that, you humans certainly do eat a lot for your size.

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,810
The shaggy old guy...

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,330
said we'd have a feast...

150
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,490
but he just kept getting yelled at for so long.

151
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,880
I couldn't wait any longer...

152
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,820
so I came here, following the smell.

153
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,920
By the way, they called you "Princess", right?

154
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,180
Yes.

155
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,990
So you're the Mermaid Princess?

156
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,850
Yes.  I am the daughter of King Neptune.

157
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,420
My name is Shirahoshi.

158
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,470
Huh?  Shirasu?

159
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,930
No, Shirahoshi.

160
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,510
Huh... That's really hard to say.

161
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,300
Ah!  I want to taste that too!

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,340
You don't seem like a bad person to me at all.

163
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,160
Since you are a pirate,
have you gone on adventures and such?

164
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,040
Yeah!

165
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,910
Oh, right.  And have you seen the sun?

166
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,770
When night falls, one can see stars floating in the sky, right?

167
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,640
And there are many different kinds of flowers, and animals with fur all over their bodies!

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,660
Have you ever been to a green place called the "forest"?

169
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,880
Wait, wait!
You're asking too many questions!  Wait a second! {Also why is my head suddenly the same size as my body? Also what the hell is wrong with your face?}{ def: rubber man... }

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Alright. { def: timing? }

171
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,770
My, what large cheeks you have.

172
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,590
What are you doing?!  Stop that!

173
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,450
O-O-Oh no...

174
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,900
Please don't yell at me so loudly.

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,820
Luffy-sama... You really are scary... after all.

176
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,760
Hey!  Why are you crying?  Cut it out!

177
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,860
Nobody has ever... scolded me before.

178
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,340
Even though you're so huge,
you're just a weakling and a crybaby, aren't you?

179
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,340
I don't like you!

180
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,770
What an awful thing to say.

181
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,450
Nobody has ever said such a thing to me.

182
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,540
You are just awful... Please leave.

183
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,630
I...

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,460
I can't take this anymore!

185
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm stuffed!

186
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,630
Thanks for the food!

187
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,420
You've been in here for ten years, huh?  I'd probably get ill from that.

188
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,490
Luffy-sama... Please leave now.

189
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,220
Say...

190
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,180
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

191
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,500
Of course... There are many places.

192
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,090
I'd bet there are.

193
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,210
Then let's get out of here!

194
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,160
What?!

195
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,710
Let's go for a walk!

196
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,930
No wait!  I can't do that.

197
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,460
What's with you?  Let's go!

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,230
It'll be alright!

199
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,440
If anything else comes flying at you,
I'll just blow it all away!

200
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,870
What?!

201
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,850
{\an8}Usopp-chin!  Nami-chin!  Brook-chin!

202
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,850
Ryuuguu Palace
Main Entrance

203
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,910
Can't you even restrain them?!

204
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,890
They're just three humans!

205
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,440
Hey, what are you doing?!

206
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,050
Everyone, if you keep fighting them,
you really will be considered criminals!

207
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,720
Be that as it may, we don't have a good reason to just quietly accept this either, Caimie-san.

208
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,600
I was really looking forward to the feast at Ryuuguu Palace, too.

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,440
If we don't fight back, we'll be captured.

210
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,550
They were the ones who turned against us for some incomprehensible reason!

211
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,110
I can take on as many of you as you like, if you so desire.

212
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,820
They're this strong, even without their captain!

213
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,320
T-They're too powerful!

214
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,220
Whatever we may or may not do in the future...

215
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,130
Do you honestly think
we'll let you arrest us for it now?!

216
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,530
Was the guy with the nose always this reliable?!

217
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,830
See?!  This is just the prologue to the future that was foretold!

218
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,440
Look who's talking!

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,960
If you hadn't attacked us,
we'd have no reason to fight you!

220
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,060
Though, these guys aren't anywhere near as tough as the giant insects on the Boin Islands!

221
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,140
Behold the power of my new weapon,
the Black Kabuto!

222
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,220
Come at me from wherever you want!

223
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,600
Neptune-sama, please help us!

224
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,700
Is it really alright to arrest someone due to a prophecy?

225
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,530
I would like some time to think about it -jamon!

226
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:28,110
Therefore I would like you to allow yourselves to be captured for the time being!

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,730
He is quite a formidable foe!

228
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,890
Zoro?!

229
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,090
I thought you were in a prison cell?!

230
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,490
I heard the festival music...

231
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,500
so I came here!

232
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,120
{\an8}Wait right there, Wadatsumi.

233
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,720
Fishman District, "Noah"

234
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,720
{\an8}Right, understood.

235
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,780
Vander Decken-sama has arrived!

236
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,400
Right this way.

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,700
Pardon the delay.

238
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,820
I ran into a volcanic eruption on the way.

239
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,060
Are you the owner of this place?  The infamous Hody,

240
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,090
I presume?

241
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,200
Just as infamous as you are.

242
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,030
The crazy Vander Decken.

243
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
Glad to be working with you.

244
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,240
Oh, a handshake?

245
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,010
That's a problem.  Wait a second.

246
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,580
This'll do.

247
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,760
Oh, don't worry about it!

248
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,420
The pleasure's all mine.

249
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,260
Nice to meet ya, Hody Jones.

250
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,340
Now, nobody on the ocean floor can oppose us.

251
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,460
All the dangerous guys are gathered here!

252
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,640
Decken!  Decken!

253
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,670
Hody!  Hody!

254
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,340
Neptune is a nuisance for both of us.

255
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,410
We both share the same objectives.

256
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,550
To crush the Neptune Army, who have neither the pride of fishmen nor merfolk.

257
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,600
To take the head of Sea God Neptune.

258
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,320
And...

259
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,660
to bring Ryuuguu Kingdom...

260
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,320
to ruin!

261
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,070
What have you guys done?!

262
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,130
Really,

263
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,480
you went way too far!

264
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,280
Indeed!  Apologize for your actions!

265
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,650
You were the ones who started this fight!  We're all in this together, you idiots!

266
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,150
We just wanted to threaten them and run away!

267
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,210
And I just wanted to go sightseeing and shopping.

268
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,350
Well, it's in the past now, so what can we do?

269
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,390
Don't complain!

270
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,070
"What can we do"?!  You think that's good enough?!

271
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,980
Just dropping by Fishman Island and then casually occupying Ryuuguu Palace...

272
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,690
How ruthless can you get?!

273
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,440
Ow...

274
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,480
So should we just have let them arrest us?!

275
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,750
I keep telling you, we should have just threatened them and fled!

276
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,250
First off, we don't know how we could escape.  Second, Luffy's not here!

277
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,870
Yeah, that's right, Luffy's gone!

278
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,200
Where did he go?

279
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,590
Where indeed?

280
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,610
We're really in a hurry here.
So don't be mean, and just tell us.

281
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,030
Yeah, we need to find Luffy!

282
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,660
Where is the treasure chamber?

283
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,830
Cut it out!

284
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,910
What?  Why?

285
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,340
Why are you acting all innocent?!  Consider our situation!

286
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,940
Now, everyone!

287
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,720
In this difficult time, let's sing a song and be happy!

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,090
Come on!

289
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,010
It'll work out somehow, it'll work out somehow.

290
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,400
And even if it doesn't, we'll die someday anyway!

291
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,150
Yeah!

292
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,520
You shut up too, Soul King!

293
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,330
Neptune-sama, are you alright?!

294
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,540
I can't believe that the champion of the sea, King Neptune, would end up like this.

295
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,470
My bad hip acted up
all of a sudden, so I couldn't fight.

296
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,740
I've really gotten old.

297
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,140
Quite a blunder -jamon!

298
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,440
Sorry!

299
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,620
We should have moved quickly and burst their bubble,
turning it into an underwater fight,

300
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,540
but they managed to get rid of all the water instead!

301
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,270
Listen up, you scum!

302
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,340
Once the three brothers of the Neptune Army, Prince Fukaboshi, Prince Ryuuboshi,

303
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,180
and Prince Manboshi get back here,

304
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,460
you're going to regret this!

305
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,920
In any case, we can't stay on Fishman Island any longer.

306
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,130
Where is the Sunny?
We need to gather everyone up and set sail.

307
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,040
But the Sunny's coating was torn off
as we entered the island.

308
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,880
The Log Pose has been acting strange too.

309
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,680
Ever since we came here,
it hasn't shown any sign of stabilizing.

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,240
You're hopeless.  You can't navigate
the New World with such a simple Pose.

311
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
You ignorant pirates.

312
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Huh?  This won't work?

313
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,700
What do you mean?

314
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,260
I'll tell you if you untie me.

315
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,100
That must be Prince Fukaboshi!

316
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,480
{\an8}Akkamanbo!  Yay!  Yay!

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,120
Hmm?  How peculiar.

318
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,470
What could the guards be doing?

319
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,680
Hello, who is this? { def: maybe we should have a style for voice from speaker }

320
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,120
Hey!  Why are you answering?!

321
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,140
Prince Fukaboshi!

322
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,440
Help us!

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,020
Be quiet, you two!

324
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,610
Prince Ryuuboshi!

325
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,830
Prince Manboshi!

326
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,550
Oh my!  Brother, something
must have happened -la-ti-do!

327
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,320
I think so too!  Are Father and Shirahoshi alright?!

328
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,210
It's me, Fukaboshi.  What is going on in there?

329
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,310
Lower the connecting channel right now, and let us in.

330
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,810
And what will happen if we do that?

331
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,150
No can do!

332
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,840
H-Hey!  What are you saying?!

333
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
Explain the situation to them!

334
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,140
That's right!  In that case, tie me and Caimie up too!

335
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,350
We don't want to be seen as your partners in crime!

336
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,740
Zoro-chin, you're scaring me!

337
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,770
Are you, by any chance, one of Straw Hat's companions?

338
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,820
Fukaboshi!  He's the swordsman with the three swords from the Straw Hat Crew...

339
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,610
Pirate Hunter Zori!

340
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,570
It's Zoro!

341
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,840
Father?!

342
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,580
You hear that?  We've got plenty of hostages, including Neptune!

343
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,150
If you want them to live,
then start making preparations for us to set sail!

344
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,010
What we'll need is our ship, the Sunny, re-coated.

345
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,020
We don't know where it is, so you guys find it.

346
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,840
Also, the rest of our crew.

347
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,680
One gloomy woman.  One robot.

348
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,670
One raccoon dog, and one pervy water imp.

349
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, Zoro!  1,000,000,000 belly, too.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,710
Cut it out, damn it!

351
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,940
A pervy water imp!  How fitting!

352
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,620
That fits him perfectly!

353
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,440
This is no time to be laughing!

354
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
Pervy water imp!

355
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,050
Come on!  At least make a jab at the "gloomy woman" comment too!

356
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,350
I understand your conditions.

357
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,460
I will make arrangements for you and your crew
to leave this kingdom safely.

358
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,760
However, you must return all of the hostages unharmed!

359
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
Brother!

360
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
We have no other choice.

361
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,810
The connecting channel is the only way
into Ryuuguu Palace.

362
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:39,140
Everywhere else, it's protected by a thick bubble layer
that we can't break through.

363
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,980
May I say one more thing, Zoro-kun?

364
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,520
I'd rather not tell you in this situation,

365
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,850
but I cannot dishonor my debt to Jinbe.

366
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,530
From the former Royal Warlord of the Sea, Sea Knight Jinbe, to Straw Hat Luffy.

367
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,600
He wanted me to tell you this once you reached the island.

368
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,030
I have two messages to pass on.

369
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,470
Jinbe, huh?

370
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,870
Jinbe?!

371
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,470
Boss Jinbe.

372
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,280
Oh yeah, he did say that he was friends with Jinbe.

373
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,450
Despite being a pirate, he's an amazing man who everyone on the island trusts.

374
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,910
Luffy isn't here right now, but I'll pass the message on to him.

375
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,690
Say it.

376
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
The first message is...

377
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,530
"Don't fight Hody."

378
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,940
The second one is...

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,500
"I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."

380
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,170
That is all.

381
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,310
The Sea Forest... Hody...

382
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,200
Fishman Island
Coral Hill

383
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,790
{\an8}They really did it!

384
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,480
{\an8}Apparently the Straw Hat Pirates have occupied Ryuuguu Palace!

385
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
{\an8}What?!

386
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,600
{\an8}What's their objective?!

387
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,500
No way!  And they seemed like such nice people.

388
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,690
How could they?

389
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,050
Kidnapping the girls from the bay,
and considering the future that was predicted...

390
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,890
It has to be them!
Things are progressing in that direction!

391
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,550
They've finally shown their true colors!

392
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,510
Apparently two of Straw Hat's companions are in the back room of the Mermaid Café.

393
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,800
The guards just went to capture them.

394
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,980
Kung Fu Point!

395
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,350
Sanji is still recovering!  Don't touch him!

396
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,610
What do you mean "come to Ryuuguu Palace"?!  You're just planning to arrest us, aren't you?!

397
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,340
Hey... you guys...

398
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,110
Sanji!  You mustn't move around yet!

399
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,900
So, will she be at that Ryuuguu Palace place?

400
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm talking about the Mermaid Princess!

401
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,720
S-She's there, but what about it?

402
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,500
Then I'll go. Even if it may kill me.

403
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,760
You're going?! Haven't you learned yet?!

404
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,320
If she's a beauty, you'll die instantly!

405
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,540
Ryuuguu Palace
"Hard-Shell Tower"

406
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,200
{\an8}Hey!  Are you done thinking yet?

407
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,760
{\an8}Let's go outside!

408
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,200
I really... can't.

409
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,060
Why not?!  You said there were places you wanted to go, right?

410
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,260
But if I do something so selfish,

411
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,660
I'll be causing trouble for everyone in the castle.

412
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,950
If I'd been locked up in here for ten years,
I'd have gone crazy.

413
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,660
This is to thank you for the food.

414
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,800
I'll be there with you, so where do you want to go?

415
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,690
Well...

416
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,560
To the Sea Forest!

417
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,940
N-No, but...

418
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,700
that's just a dream.

419
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,280
I couldn't possibly do something
as selfish as breaking out of here.

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,070
Why are you starting to cry just from saying where you want to go?!

421
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,820
I-I'm sorry.

422
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,620
I had to gather up so much courage just to say it.

423
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,150
P-Please don't be mad at me!

424
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,980
You're scary, Luffy-sama!

425
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,620
You're such a pain!

426
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,090
What?!  What was that loud noise?!

427
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,260
Is he throwing something at us again?

428
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,060
What a rude guy.

429
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,970
What's that?

430
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,850
W-What is that sound -jamon?

431
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,120
Could it be Decken's doing?!

432
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,700
It's coming from Hard-Shell Tower -jamon!
S-S-Shirahoshi is in danger!

433
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,380
A-Are the guards with her?!

434
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,080
No, they're all tied up here!

435
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,800
H-Hey, pirates!

436
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,460
Go and ensure the princess' safety in place of the guards!

437
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Huh?  What're you talking about?

438
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,000
But Neptune-sama!
That means letting them know about the princess!

439
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,860
What choice do we have?!

440
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,380
Hard-Shell Tower is on the northeast side of the palace!

441
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,960
All of you, go there right now!

442
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,070
Why do we have to take orders from our hostage?

443
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,840
Silence!  Shirahoshi is my only daughter!

444
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,380
For that reason, she's constantly being targeted!

445
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,620
If anything happens to my daughter, I will drive you into the bottom of the deep sea!

446
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,240
So basically, she is the Mermaid Princess?  Am I right?

447
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,360
If so, I shall go to her as soon as I can!

448
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,110
And then...

449
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,030
I wonder if she will show me her panties?

450
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,500
Hey, wait, Brook!

451
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,660
Oh, what are we to do?!
He dashed off with indecent motives!

452
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,000
Now the princess is in danger
for an entirely different reason!

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,720
Wait, skeleton!

454
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,330
You can keep me tied up, but please take me with you!

455
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,400
Hard-Shell Tower is under my jurisdiction.

456
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,950
If anything happens to the princess,
I will never be at peace.  Even in death!

457
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,490
You...

458
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,230
must...

459
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,720
really love her, right?

460
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't be absurd!

461
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,280
How shameless!

462
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,040
No!

463
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,060
Sanji-san, I will be going there first if you don't mind!

464
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,020
I've always wanted to go to the Sea Forest.

465
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,940
All this time, throughout these past ten years.

466
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,560
But... everyone warns me that
it's too dangerous to leave the tower.

467
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,530
So I'm scared of going outside.

468
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,160
Luffy-sama, will you really take me there?

469
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,260
Sure.

470
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,850
Will you really protect me?

471
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,710
Leave it to me!  It'll be fine!

472
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,880
Hey!  If you're gonna cry, then I won't take you anywhere!

473
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,680
Besides, to be honest, it's more like you'll be taking me there.

474
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,520
I can't swim, after all.

475
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,890
I-I'm so sorry.  I'm just too happy.

476
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,980
You really are a crybaby, huh?

477
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,130
And a weakling.

478
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,940
But if we go outside, you'll stand out so much that you'll get spotted right away.

479
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,970
Right... I'm so sorry.

480
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,140
So I have an idea to deal with that!

481
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,450
Mermaid Princess!  Are you alright?

482
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,500
Hey, skeleton!  Look at the side of the tower!

483
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,200
Huh?

484
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,260
That's insane!  Those aren't the usual knives or axes that come flying!

485
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,060
That sound was human pirates crashing into the tower!

486
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,700
How bizarre!

487
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,160
That Vander Decken is insane!

488
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,140
What?!  V-Vander Decken?!

489
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,940
This isn't good!  They're getting up!

490
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:58,820
This means... Enemy soldiers have invaded the impenetrable Ryuuguu Palace!

491
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,140
This is a sneak attack!  The king is in danger!

492
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,670
The princess is in danger!

493
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,890
The sounds of the attacks have stopped, right?

494
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,760
Let's go, weakling!

495
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,030
Y-Yes!

496
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,020
I'm counting on you, Megalo!

497
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,750
Go, shark!

498
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,760
Megalo!

499
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,020
Luffy-san!

500
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,790
To the Sea Forest!
