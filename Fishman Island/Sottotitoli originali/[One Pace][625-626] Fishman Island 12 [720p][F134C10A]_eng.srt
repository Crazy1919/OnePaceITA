1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,160
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,710
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,430
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,070
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,220
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,590
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,620
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,200
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,670
Ryuuguu Palace!  Ryuuguu Palace!

10
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,630
This is the Border Police!

11
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,420
An enormous shipwreck is requesting emergency entrance!

12
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,620
{\an5}The Shipwrecked Celestial Dragon!
A Bullet that Seals the Future

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,380
What are you doing?! 
Naturally, you have to let them in-

14
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,930
If I'm not mistaken...

15
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,350
a Celestial Dragon is onboard!

16
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,890
What?!

17
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,230
King Neptune!

18
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,190
A Celestial Dragon?!

19
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,540
Grant him access!

20
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,900
Send an emergency unit to the coast!

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,390
Yes, Ma'am!

22
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,910
I will be there shortly.

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,790
Otohime-sama!

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,250
What business does a Celestial Dragon have on the ocean floor?

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,700
A Celestial Dragon's ship...

26
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,160
It looks like it was attacked by a deep sea creature.

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,210
What business do Celestial Dragons,
who discriminate against us, have on the ocean floor?

28
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,170
Hurry it up!

29
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,560
Damn it!  Those spineless cowards all died on me!

30
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,060
Hurry and bring me a mask, you pathetic fish-creatures!

31
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,420
This place reeks of fishmen!

32
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,940
Hurry and bring me a mask!

33
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,670
Save my life, you imbeciles!

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,620
Just how self-centered...

35
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,950
Is that really the attitude
someone asking for help should have?

36
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,280
Doctor!

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,960
Get me a doctor!

38
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,450
Where's the medical team?

39
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,160
They're here, but...

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,210
they're not sure what to do about him.

41
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,030
We should kill him.

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,170
The worst type of trash in the world.

43
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,520
There sure is a lot of noise coming from the port.

44
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,490
Hey.

45
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,980
Captain, apparently a Celestial Dragon has come here.

46
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,160
A Celestial Dragon?

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,960
Seems he got here on a wrecked ship,
and he's now asking for help.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
Sounds interesting.

49
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,540
Let's go take a look.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,490
This wasn't supposed to happen...

51
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,720
What? My fishman slaves
have returned to Fishman Island?

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,970
Why did that happen, My Daddy?

53
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,930
From what I hear, My Son,

54
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,150
the latest addition to the Seven Warlords of the Sea
 was a fishman named Jinbe.

55
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,820
Jinbe?

56
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,160
The slaves who fled and joined the Sun Pirates,
which he was a part of,

57
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,890
were given a pardon by the Government, forgiven for the sin of running away,

58
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,160
and returned to their country, it seems, My Son.

59
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,880
I'm sure that the slaves that ran away from my house
are among them, My Daddy!

60
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,620
They must be.

61
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,760
When I think about how they must be living
such carefree lives right now, I get really annoyed!

62
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,640
In that case, I'll go get them back, My Daddy!

63
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,140
My fishman slave collection,
that I spent so much money gathering!

64
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,230
Damn it... I didn't know...

65
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,540
that the deep seas were this terrifying.

66
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,430
Hey!  What are you doing?!

67
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,470
Long time no see, Myosgard.

68
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,890
You dare address me without honorifics... Huh?

69
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,340
Oh, you are... my slaves.

70
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,940
Obediently come back to my home!

71
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,440
Who gave you permission to be free,
damn fish-creatures?!

72
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,710
S-Stop it, you guys!

73
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,660
He's a Celestial Dragon!
Lay a hand on him, and your pardons will be void!

74
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,170
Stop it, you fool!  Know your place!

75
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,050
Do you have any idea who I am?!

76
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,470
I am... I am...

77
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,360
Up on the surface, a Navy Admiral will immediately be dispatched if a Celestial Dragon is harmed.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,270
That's the only reason why everyone fears you.

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,380
However, this is Fishman Island, on the bottom of the sea.

80
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,910
As long as the citizens here keep quiet, it won't matter what happens to you.

81
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,440
It'll just be assumed you had an accident.

82
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,420
That's true.

83
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,720
I won't say a thing!

84
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Neither will I!  Of course!

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,810
He's barely alive anyway!
He'll die if we just ignore him!

86
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,420
Let him taste the pain you had to endure as slaves!

87
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,530
Kill him!

88
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,930
Let him suffer, and kill him!

89
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,270
Don't forgive him!

90
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,050
What?  I am great...

91
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,220
Even if I wanted to forgive...

92
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,320
You're the one person I could never forgive!

93
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,390
Hey, stop!

94
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,020
Do it!

95
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,890
Kill him!

96
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,070
Stop!

97
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,990
Damn fish-creatures!

98
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,750
Queen Otohime!

99
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,810
Her Majesty's been shot!

100
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,970
Queen Otohime...

101
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,350
Everyone... Please throw away your guns.

102
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,690
The children are watching!

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,070
Aladdin!

104
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,230
What's this I heard
about a shipwrecked Celestial Dragon?

105
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,040
I only just got here myself.

106
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,750
Boss Jinbe!

107
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,720
Mother raced out of the castle.

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,970
What?!

109
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,680
Big Brother, who are these Celestial Dragons?

110
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,320
They're humans, Shirahoshi.

111
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,350
Humans?

112
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,570
Out of all the humans in the world, they're among the scariest ones.

113
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,120
I heard several gunshots.  Let's hurry.

114
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,950
Yes.

115
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,590
Otohime-sama...

116
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,310
It only grazed me.

117
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,950
Why did you protect him?!

118
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,540
Do you know what that man did to us in the past?!

119
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,050
He treated us worse than slaves, even worse than cattle!

120
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,660
I can hear the screams of
your hearts so clearly, it hurts.

121
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,300
Mother...

122
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,530
Mother!

123
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,310
I know it must be difficult for you,

124
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,170
but your anger and hatred toward the humans...

125
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,570
Do not pass it on to the children!

126
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,410
Think of what they must face from now on!

127
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,190
So, I beg of you! {Copy-paste from 543}

128
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,170
Don't tell the people on our island anything!

129
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,340
Not about the tragedy that befell us,
nor about our anger towards the humans. {End copy-paste from 453}

130
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,720
Brother Ti...

131
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,290
Look out, Mother!

132
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,900
Don't move!

133
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,700
Oh no!  Your Majesty!

134
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,160
Mother!

135
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,450
What?!

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,270
Sea Kings?!

137
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,010
What... was that?!

138
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,680
It couldn't just be a coincidence.

139
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,750
Shirahoshi... You couldn't be...

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,840
What's wrong, Captain?

141
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,230
There is a legend passed down in my family...

142
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:59,310
In the distant past, there lived a Mermaid Princess
who possessed the sacred power to control Sea Kings!

143
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,580
My forefather Vander Decken traveled to the ocean floor in pursuit of that legend!

144
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,780
Honored forefather!  I have finally found it!

145
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,140
Shirahoshi is the legendary Mermaid Princess?!

146
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,090
You did it, Captain!

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,660
It would be bad if anyone else heard about this!

148
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,880
This is a secret legend, that only my family knows of...

149
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,420
I presume!

150
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,580
If I could freely control the Sea Kings and have them do my bidding,

151
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,160
everyone would have to do as I told them!

152
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,770
I would be able to take whatever I wanted!

153
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,640
So, what are you going to do?

154
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,850
Are we going to kidnap Princess Shirahoshi?

155
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,650
First, I must become the princess's husband!

156
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,890
Whaaaaaat?!

157
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,650
But Princess Shirahoshi is still a kid!

158
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,610
Indeed, and therein lies the problem!

159
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,930
Aladdin.

160
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,210
I will... treat his wounds.

161
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,190
And yours as well, Otohime-sama, as soon as I can.

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,220
Some weeks later, after the Celestial Dragon's treatment was complete and his life had been saved,

163
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,580
and he was about to leave for his homeland...

164
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,890
Queen Otohime made an astonishing move.

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,390
Remember this!

166
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,700
All the tactlessness and rudeness that I, a World Noble, had to endure here...

167
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,470
Damn fish-creatures!
I swear I will make you regret them!

168
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,270
We saved his life, so why does he resent us?!

169
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,850
Our country gave him
the ship and crew to take him home.

170
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,530
How can he talk to us like that?

171
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,180
We shouldn't let him leave.
He'll just put the island in even greater danger.

172
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,790
Please, wait!

173
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,950
We still have some unfinished business, it seems.

174
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,550
That being the case,
I will accompany you to the surface.

175
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,800
To the surface?!

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,680
That's crazy!  Otohime-sama!

177
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,970
Mother!

178
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,530
Wait -jamon, Otohime!

179
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,750
I will not allow you to do something so self-centered!

180
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,810
If you absolutely must settle things with the Nobles, then I will go!

181
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:28,360
You are the king and a great knight,
I'm sure you'd never be captured by the humans...

182
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,780
That's why it should be me!

183
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,240
No.  If someone as strong as you went,
it would be meaningless.

184
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,330
If the weak cannot travel there and return safely,

185
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,570
we cannot prove to our citizens that the surface is safe.

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,420
That is why I, who am weaker than most,

187
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
must go to the surface.

188
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,880
Mother!

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,760
Mother!

190
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,400
Otohime-sama!

191
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,860
Are you going somewhere, Otohime-sama?

192
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,600
Otohime...

193
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,990
Believe...

194
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,160
in the wife you chose, and in the humans.

195
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,350
She's merely the queen of
these fish-creatures!  Such conceit!

196
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,500
Mother!

197
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,130
Mother!

198
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,870
Jinbe...

199
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,480
Nobody could have possibly stopped her.

200
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,890
We can only believe in her, and wait.

201
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,030
Your Majesty!  Please, be safe!

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,030
Otohime-sama!

203
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,500
Mother!

204
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,550
The Ryuuguu Kingdom was enveloped in a cycle of sleepless nights caused by uncertainty.

205
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,720
But there was nothing we could do except pray for the Queen's safety.

206
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,020
{\an8}Japanese folklore object resembling Pandora's Box

207
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,020
What's that?  The Tamate Box?

208
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,540
That's right, Captain!
Amazingly enough, I hear it's in Ryuuguu Palace!

209
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,240
And anyone that opens the box immediately grows old?

210
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,620
That's right!  That's how it works.

211
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,890
So, for example,
if a little squirt like this kid were to open it...

212
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,790
she'd become a sexy broad
above the age of consent?

213
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,640
She most certainly would.

214
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,390
Yes!  My problem is solved!

215
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,390
Then I could quickly marry Princess Shirahoshi...

216
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,170
I presume!

217
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,590
Go steal that Tamate Box immediately!

218
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,550
No... wait a second...
Breaking into Ryuuguu Palace ain't so easy.

219
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,610
But if you marry Shirahoshi first...

220
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,980
then you could come and go as you please.

221
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,020
You guys sure are smart.

222
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Shirahoshi ain't exactly ugly,

223
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,200
so she should be a good looking broad in ten or twenty years.

224
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,550
But she'll be even bigger.

225
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,870
That's even better.
I don't have anything against big women!

226
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,460
That girl is the legendary Mermaid Princess who can control Sea Kings.

227
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,170
I will become her husband,

228
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,930
and once I've gotten that power, I will finally realize...

229
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,510
the dream that the Vander Decken family has sought after for generations!

230
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,170
Alright, now let's get started on the wedding invitations.

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,190
Proposing comes first!

232
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,690
Oh!  I don't have any friends!

233
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,530
Days passed without any news of the Queen.

234
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,700
The uncertainty just grew and grew.

235
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,040
Man, I even miss her speeches.

236
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,870
Please, somehow, come back alive.

237
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,660
Hey, Boss, where's Otohime-sama?

238
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,800
When's she coming back?

239
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,300
Have faith in her and wait.

240
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,050
She set out on this journey for the sake of your future.

241
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,520
Your Highness, please be safe.

242
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,860
Mother...

243
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,370
It's fine -jamon.  Believe in her and wait -jamon.

244
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,220
A week passed, which felt like 100 days.

245
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,920
And then...

246
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,370
Hooray!  Otohime-sama!

247
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
Your Highness!

248
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,050
Just knowing that she's alive... We're so...

249
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,140
Welcome home!

250
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,320
Your Highness...

251
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,850
It took several days to persuade them,

252
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,280
but Queen Otohime finally calmed the Celestial Dragons...

253
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,850
and the sheet of paper that she brought back...

254
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,910
could be called the light of hope for Fishman Island.

255
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,300
Attention everyone!
The World Nobles have a lot of political power...

256
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,980
when it comes to the Council of Kings, and even the World Council.

257
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,510
This was written by a World Noble.
Here's what it says:

258
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,680
"For peace and friendship between fishmen and humans,

259
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,060
I hereby endorse
the proposal of the attached petition."

260
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,700
In other words, when we submit
all of our signatures to the World Council Meeting,

261
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,240
by including this single piece of paper we will have actual power.

262
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,070
We will definitely be able to emigrate to the surface.

263
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,830
The Celestial Dragons are backing it?

264
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,700
Politics is complicated.

265
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,590
All we have to do
is to collect a large number of signatures...

266
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,290
so the final decision is yours.
I can only wait while you decide.

267
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,460
How about it?  Live alongside the humans?

268
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,050
Please indicate your desire to emigrate to the surface.

269
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,340
Please!  Your signatures!

270
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:54,180
Children, aren't you just trying to make me happy,
only to ask to take them back later?

271
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,680
Nope!
Mom said she's gonna submit one, too!

272
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,990
Otohime-sama.  This small box just ain't big enough!

273
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,590
Just how many people do you think are in this country?

274
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,400
That's right!  Start using this box, please!

275
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,860
Put your signatures into this box
to say that you support the Queen's burning dream!

276
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,080
Fishmen and humans.  We're turning
our eyes away from the history of segregation.

277
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,510
But, it was the Queen's decision to take
those first bold steps that gave birth to this hope.

278
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,400
If we can gather just a few more signatures,

279
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,570
we might really change Fishman Island's future.

280
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,940
If he'd been touched
by Queen Otohime's burning conviction,

281
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,740
even Arlong might have been saved.

282
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,580
I wish Brother Ti could have seen this...

283
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,840
It was at that moment...
when I gained the courage to truly change this island.

284
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,860
That moment?

285
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,430
Yes, the day when the Sea Kings peeked in on Fishman Island.

286
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,710
I think everyone was surprised that day.

287
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,470
They came because Shirahoshi called them.

288
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,260
What!?

289
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,920
All fishmen are capable of
communicating their feelings to fish,

290
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,200
so we're certainly able to talk to them, right?

291
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,040
But not just anyone can talk to those great Sea Kings.

292
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,630
Even the only person capable of communicating with whales, your father, Neptune, can't do it.

293
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,490
There is a legend that is passed down
through the royal family.

294
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:36,090
Every few hundred years, a mermaid will be born with the ability to communicate with Sea Kings.

295
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,230
Those humongous Sea Kings?

296
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,500
You're talking about Shirahoshi?

297
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,260
That's right.  Someday, someone capable of guiding her power to be used for the right purpose will appear,

298
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:52,480
and this will bring about a great change to the world.  Or so the legends say.

299
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,770
The whole world?

300
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,040
If that's true, I'm sure that great changes will occur on this island too.

301
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,230
So, maybe that power will assist your efforts?

302
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,240
I think so.

303
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,510
If you want to save people, it's a power of love capable of saving thousands of lives.

304
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,830
But if a dark-hearted person were to wield it,
they could sink the whole world under the sea.

305
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,710
One of the most terrifying powers in this world.

306
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,590
She still hasn't realized that she wields this power,

307
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,470
and she can't control it yet.

308
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,710
If Shirahoshi experiences another shock, even greater than the one before,

309
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,280
she may unconsciously
send the Sea Kings on a rampage.

310
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,170
If that happens,
Fishman Island could be turned into rubble!

311
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,370
What should we do?!

312
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,820
Don't worry about it now.
I'll figure something out eventually, so it's fine.

313
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,250
For now, the three of you should concentrate on
growing up and becoming magnificent warriors.

314
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:58,630
Please, as big brothers and as warriors, you must protect your little sister with your life.

315
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,500
I understand!

316
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,260
Of course!

317
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,220
Thank you.

318
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,280
But then the incident happened, without any warning.

319
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,980
Get back!  They're going up in flames!

320
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,230
How did the signature box suddenly catch fire?

321
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,070
Water!  Get water!

322
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,570
Quickly, put the fire out!

323
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,860
How could this happen?!

324
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,990
After all the effort we went through to collect the signatures!

325
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,370
Otohime-sama's been shot!

326
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,540
Who the hell?!

327
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,250
There's a sniper out there!  Protect the Royal Family!

328
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,300
Mother!

329
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
Mother!

330
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,000
It's too dangerous here!
Please fall back to the Ryuuguu Gondola.

331
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,130
Princes!

332
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,140
Your Highness!  Your Highness!

333
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,410
Otohime-sama!

334
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,920
Hey Princess, this must be difficult for you...

335
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,850
Who are you!?

336
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,190
Oh no!

337
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,860
Don't approach the Princess!

338
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,930
Hold it right there!

339
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,660
Mother!  Mother!

340
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,310
Mother!

341
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,080
Dammit!  Who the hell did this?!

342
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,230
Why aren't the paramedics here yet?!

343
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,910
Mother!  Mother!

344
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,340
Open your eyes!

345
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,870
Unforgivable!
I'll destroy whoever is responsible for this!

346
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,640
Mother!

347
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,900
Stay by my side, my little angels.  Don't make such scary faces.

348
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:01,540
I was careless.
All those signatures made me so happy.

349
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,410
Truly happy!

350
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,230
Prince Fukaboshi, I'm the one who is upset...

351
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,160
Your Highness!  We're ready to treat you!

352
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,250
So, whoever the culprit is...

353
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,810
please don't be angry for me.

354
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:31,590
Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me.

355
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,410
Mother!

356
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,630
Shirahoshi.  Control yourself.

357
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,090
If Shirahoshi experiences another shock, greater than the one before...

358
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,710
This...

359
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,950
Shirahoshi, no...

360
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,290
Hey!  Shirahoshi!

361
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:39,250
Akkamanbo akamanbo!  Akkamanbo akamanbo!

362
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,770
Look!  Shirahoshi!

363
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,710
Akkamanbo akamanbo!

364
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,640
It's fun!  It's fun!

365
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,010
There's nothing to cry about!  Let's sing, Shirahoshi!

366
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,280
The three of us will always be here for you -la ti do!

367
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,530
Manbo dancing sure is fun!

368
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,410
So fun!

369
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,600
Yeah!  Fun -do re mi fa!

370
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,510
What are the princes doing?!

371
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,220
Stop them!

372
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,640
This isn't appropriate!

373
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,340
Mother!  Look!  Look!  It's fine!

374
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,780
We'll always protect her like this -la ti do!

375
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,020
Please stop!
Don't you understand Her Highness's condition?

376
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:37,480
Mother.  We'll recollect the burnt signatures.

377
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,350
We'll become great soldiers like our father.

378
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,040
Just as we promised,
we'll protect Shirahoshi with our lives!

379
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,370
So please...

380
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,630
P-Please, don't worry!

381
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,330
It's just a hair's breadth away... The light of the real sun.

382
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,740
There he is!  We've found the assassin!

383
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,520
Hurry!  Hurry to the roof!

384
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,190
Is that him?!

385
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,830
Where is the assassin?

386
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,270
Jinbe-san!

387
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,310
We just took him down.

388
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,050
Who was it?

389
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,040
Well...

390
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,010
This is...

391
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,430
a human?!

392
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,600
Don't let anyone know!

393
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,130
What?  Boss Jinbe?

394
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,310
What?!

395
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,280
What would become of all of Her Majesty's efforts?

396
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,890
This would destroy them completely.

397
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,860
Isn't that just too much?!

398
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,600
But this is the harsh reality.

399
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
No!  He's a pirate!

400
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,540
Whether or not he's a pirate is irrelevant.

401
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,340
Don't do it, Hody!

402
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,500
Stop!

403
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,510
Listen up, all of you!

404
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,190
A human...

405
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,740
killed our country's queen!

406
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,830
Queen Otohime's killer was human!

407
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,650
How could this happen?!

408
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,720
A human.

409
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,570
Her Majesty kept telling us to live with them...

410
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,990
and moved by her words,

411
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,060
we had decided to walk beside them.

412
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,520
But now a human...

413
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,210
has shattered that dream.

414
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,280
He's taken the life of the person we all dearly loved!

415
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,780
You may be dead, but that doesn't
give us Queen Otohime back, human!

416
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,320
Has this world been forsaken by God and Buddha alike?!

417
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,210
This is too cruel!

418
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,230
Far too cruel!

419
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,610
Is His Majesty still inside Koukaku Tower?

420
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,070
Minister of the Left...

421
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,360
It is as you hear.

422
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,620
He said that he couldn't control himself.

423
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,500
Lock the door!

424
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,940
Don't open it until my bloodthirst passes!

425
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,800
Your Majesty...

426
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,820
It's me.

427
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,640
Minister of the Left...

428
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,170
The culprit was still carrying a gun...

429
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,980
so the soldiers shot him down.

430
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,540
It was a human!

431
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,560
I would have killed him even if he was unarmed!

432
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,660
But I'm sure Otohime would
never have forgiven me for that.

433
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,420
I don't know when this cycle of revenge started...

434
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,370
but if I had killed him,
I'd have just been sucked into that very cycle.

435
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,130
And any children who saw it...

436
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,750
would have the seed of hatred planted in their hearts,
so they'd also be dragged in.

437
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,850
The cycle would grow even larger.

438
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,340
In my head, I understand what Otohime told us.

439
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,890
Or rather,
I could if this was happening to someone else!

440
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:51,460
But... why can't I kill someone if they kill my wife?!

441
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,180
I just don't get it -jamon.

442
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,830
I lived as a warrior
and avenged countless fallen comrades.

443
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,380
Many humans attacked me, and I crushed them.

444
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,720
After all that, I didn't think I had the right to help with Otohime's campaign,

445
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,300
so I just watched over her instead.

446
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,690
Why do the innocent die... while I still keep on living?!

447
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:30,340
Even if I tried to continue Otohime's work,
I would just look like a hypocrite -jamon.

448
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:37,580
But... peoples' hearts constantly change.
We are all full of contradictions.

449
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,100
Both fishmen and humans.

450
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,600
And there will always be things
that only a warrior can protect.

451
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,550
Your Majesty!

452
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,680
Sorry for worrying you.

453
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,690
I couldn't miss my own wife's funeral -jamon.

454
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,140
Father!  Father!

455
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,660
Shirahoshi...

456
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,340
Father.

457
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,050
Children...

458
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,920
Thank goodness.

459
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,150
Forgive me... for not being here when you needed me.

460
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,420
Father, look at this.

461
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,680
What's this?

462
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,530
Wherever I go, letters keep flying after me.

463
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,700
This is the fifth one already, Father.

464
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,100
This is... a love letter?!

465
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,310
Shirahoshi is still only six years old!

466
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,580
Who is this Vander Decken?!

467
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,520
He's from a family of pirates.

468
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,550
Don't let the children attend the funeral!

469
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,700
The assassin might still have
some allies running around.

470
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,800
And as for this pirate named Decken,
capture him immediately!

471
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Yes, Sir!

472
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,680
Everyone...

473
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,510
The monitor...

474
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,450
Prince Fukaboshi?

475
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,150
Fukaboshi...

476
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,370
Just before she died,
our mother told us with a smile on her face...

477
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,040
that the light of the real sun was just a hair's breadth away.

478
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,020
We have decided to dedicate our lives to fulfilling our mother's wish.

479
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,580
Princes...

480
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:33,250
Your hearts may not heal
in time for the World Council Meeting in two years...

481
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,090
but there's another one in six years.  And yet another in ten years!

482
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,860
I'm sure you have conflicted feelings about humans following this incident.

483
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,540
We discarded all the signatures
that hadn't already burned to ash.

484
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,940
Let's restart from square one!

485
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:04,430
Someday...
when everyone's hearts have had time to heal...

486
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,130
let us... dream of the sun together!
