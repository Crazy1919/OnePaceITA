1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,400
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,950
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,300
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,430
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,830
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,840
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,440
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,860
So how are they -jamon, Jinbe?

10
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,610
I never would have thought that
the Sun Pirates would align with Big Mom.

11
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,240
Are they really okay with it?

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,800
It'd be quite a stretch to call her a reasonable woman,
but she gives us a lot of freedom.

13
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,720
Well, I just thought...

14
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,350
a man like you would never
work under anyone but Fisher Tiger.

15
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,150
Not at all.

16
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,420
I don't mind having someone else as my boss.

17
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,620
Besides, in the New World...

18
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,910
having an alliance with one of the Four Emperors is the best way to protect your crew.

19
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,350
Really?  It seems to me
that you did it to protect Fishman Island.

20
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,850
Because of your actions,

21
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,030
Fishman Island has been able
to use Big Mom's name after Whitebeard's death,

22
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,940
and so we've stayed relatively safe.

23
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh, that's just a coincidence.

24
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,330
Normally we would protect the island ourselves, but...

25
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,340
seeing as how we're wanted men...

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,460
But, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm thinking of separating myself from Big Mom.

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,520
Oh?  Are you going to accept Luffy-kun's offer?

29
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,330
Hey, Jinbe. {Copy-paste from 568}

30
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,470
Join my crew! {End copy-paste from 568}

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,510
Yes, I have been considering it.

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,420
But there are duties and obligations I must take into account.

33
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,380
I've formed promises and bonds through words and shared cups.

34
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,180
Now, if I break those bonds I have to be prepared...

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,120
This is a worst case scenario,

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,230
but we can't rule out the possibility
that Big Mom's anger could engulf this island.

37
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,450
As always, you try to carry too much responsibility on your shoulders -jamon, Jinbe.

38
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,870
If that comes to pass, then we'll deal with it then.

39
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,690
I have plans of my own -jamon.

40
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:46,460
Just today, I gained seventy thousand new soldiers from the Fishman District, even if they're rowdy.

41
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,880
Don't worry -jamon.

42
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,950
And besides,
even if this island does lose Big Mom's flag,

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,550
there's another flag
I would love to borrow for protection.

44
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,370
The flag with a skull wearing a straw hat -jamon!

45
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,470
I see!  That is a nice flag, isn't it?

46
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,460
Your Majesty!

47
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,000
T-T-T-This is awful!

48
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,440
Your Majesty!

49
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,220
What is it, Right Minister?  Why are you panicking?

50
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,500
I remembered something awful!

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,540
It's about our promise to give all the stolen treasure to Luffy-kun's crew if they found it.

52
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,880
If they do find it,
please make them return the Tamate Box, at least!

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,590
What are you talking about?!

54
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,260
I promised them that they could have it, and I won't tell them to give it back now!

55
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,630
B-But...

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,090
What?!  If they open it, it'll explode?!

57
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,420
Why would you put a bomb in it?!

58
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,710
W-Well, you see...

59
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,020
Ten years ago,
when someone emptied the Tamate Box,

60
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,120
we figured we'd set up a trap so that if another treasure thief showed up, they wouldn't get away.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
So we filled the box with bombs...

62
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,150
and made it so that if it was opened, it would cause a huge explosion.

63
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,420
As the one who holds the key
to the treasure chamber and the Tamate Box, I...

64
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,000
Alright, I understand.

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,300
If Luffy-kun and the others find the treasure, you'll explain the situation and ask them to return the box.

66
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,130
I'm really sorry about this!

67
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,440
But what if Luffy-kun and the others open it before they get back?

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,530
I'm worried about that, too.

69
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,430
Your Majesty!  Right Minister!

70
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,910
Luffy-san and his group
just returned to Ryuuguu Palace.

71
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,540
Oh!  They made it back without any trouble?

72
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,240
Thank goodness!
I suppose I shouldn't have worried so much.

73
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,120
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,800
You gave...

75
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,480
Big Mom...

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,910
all the treasure?!

77
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,800
She was saying something about how
she'd destroy Fishman Island if she didn't get candy!

78
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,210
She's crazy!  I mean, I'd understand
if it was meat she was talking about...

79
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,620
But don't worry about it!

80
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,240
I picked a fight with her!

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,130
With one of the Four Emperors?!

82
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,230
You picked a fight with Big Mom?!

83
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,220
You're strong, right, Luffy-sama?

84
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,350
That's not the issue here!

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,570
Noseopp-sama, you're so scary...

86
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,950
I'm telling you, my name is Usopp!

87
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,170
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,220
What a bother... This is not good.

89
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,250
I'll have to cut my ties with Big Mom before the whole deal breaks down.

90
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,680
Anyway, don't do anything
that might make Big Mom angrier than she is already.

91
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,910
Of course we won't!  If we get on the bad side of one of the Four Emperors, we'll be obliterated instantly!

92
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,270
Hey, isn't this really bad, Right Minister?

93
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,070
How could this happen?!

94
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,570
Now the Tamate Box will end up with Big Mom,

95
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,510
and if she opens it herself, she'll take the explosion
as a declaration of war from Luffy-san!

96
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,600
This is just awful -jamon!

97
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,050
Well, it's not like there's anything we can do about it.

98
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,190
What's done is done.

99
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,870
We'll reap what we've sowed.
I suppose there's no way out of fighting her now.

100
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,810
That's right!  No matter who the enemy is, we'll-

101
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
Why...

102
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,200
did you give her all the treasure?!

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,220
That's the problem?!

104
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm gonna punch you!

105
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,970
Uh, you already did!

106
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,990
Awlight... Wet'hs go to da New Wold.

107
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,670
The future looks completely bleak!

108
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,480
It's hopeless!  We're done for!

109
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,500
Meanwhile, near the Candy Factory...

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,590
Dammit!  Without me noticing,
someone wandered off with all my treasure!

111
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,500
Who did it?!  I'm definitely gonna kill'em!

112
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,960
I know I'd gain favor with that person if I offer them...

113
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,450
a mountain of treasure
and the secret about the Mermaid Princess!

114
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280
A crowd!

115
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,010
Who are those two guys carrying gigantic sacks?

116
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,730
That's it!  No doubt about it!

117
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,840
Who are those nobodies?!  I'm gonna bury 'em alive!

118
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,910
That's the treasure I stole!  Give it back, damn you!

119
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,120
Hmm?

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,230
I've seen him before somewhere -gao.

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,090
Ah, here he is.

122
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,710
Wet Hair Caribou.
He's a rookie who's been popping up a lot recently.

123
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,360
Oh, he's worth 200 million.

124
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,690
A-A 200 million bounty?!

125
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,910
It's too late to pray for your lives now!

126
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,970
Go ahead and get filled with holes!

127
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,140
Sir Pekoms!

128
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,900
What's that?

129
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,870
A turtle?

130
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,920
You're a Devil Fruit user?

131
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,650
Of course I am!

132
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,250
But it's just a Zoan-type fruit, huh?!

133
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,640
Die!

134
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:29,290
Logia-users who think they're invincible
don't live very long.

135
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,210
Half-boiled challengers
are always so disappointing -soir.

136
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,800
Time to go -bon, Pekoms.

137
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,480
Back to Mama.

138
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,690
He took out a man worth 200 million in one hit.

139
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,190
If I remember it right,
Sir Pekoms's bounty is 330 million.

140
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,290
A bounty over 300 million. That's how strong the crews of the Four Emperors are?

141
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,060
Will Luffy-san and the others really be alright?

142
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,490
Meanwhile, in the New World,
in the waters near the Red Line...

143
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,870
Fire!

144
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,160
Hurry!  Another ship emerging at two o'clock!

145
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,470
Pirate ships are emerging from the sea,
one after another!

146
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,600
What's going on here?!

147
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,510
You think you'll make her like you by doing that?

148
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,420
Shaddup!  Back off!

149
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,600
We've finally been freed from Hell!  There's no way...

150
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,570
Here comes a big one!

151
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,230
The captain is in trouble!

152
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,400
I'll hold her tight to shield her from harm!

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,530
No, let me handle that vital mission!

154
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,330
Sheesh!

155
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,530
Again?!

156
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,420
Great!  That's our Captain-chan!

157
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,390
Her swordplay is just too beautiful for words!

158
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,250
And that isn't the only thing that's beautiful about her!

159
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,610
Take this seriously, all of you!

160
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,250
Haven't you been trained
to shield yourselves from bombardments?!

161
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,380
If you aren't going to show the results
of your training now, then when will you?!

162
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,980
Captain, that's the mast.

163
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,710
I finished polishing your glasses!

164
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,930
Thank you.

165
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,360
She's so cute!
The lone flower growing in the filth of G-5!

166
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,490
If you keep fooling around like this in battle...

167
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,930
you're going to get yourselves killed immediately!

168
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,140
You G-5 soldiers are just hopeless.

169
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,890
How can you call yourselves marines?!

170
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,310
If you look down on me
for being a girl, you'll regret it!

171
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,330
We don't look down on you!
We're just drawn to your cuteness!

172
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,850
That's what I meant by looking down on me!

173
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,900
You don't understand what a marine is supposed to-

174
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,430
Be quiet, Tashigi.

175
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,240
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

176
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,450
Pardon me!

177
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:22,350
I see.  So you were all captured
by the pirate Hody Jones on the ocean floor?

178
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,140
That explains why no rookies
have made it past Fishman Island in the past month.

179
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,910
Captured?!  That's not it, we were his slaves!

180
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,350
But a certain pirate crew defeated Hody's group,
who were also behind the rebellion,

181
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,020
and freed us!

182
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,690
A certain pirate crew?

183
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,940
I-I can't tell you who they were, but...

184
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,520
Y-You dumbass!  Just tell him already!

185
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,480
These guys aren't normal marines!  They're the G-5!

186
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,760
They use pirates as bait to go fishing for sharks,

187
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,350
or burn pirates as firewood on their campfires!

188
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,220
They're a group of insane maverick marines who don't even obey the orders from HQ!

189
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,350
If they arrest us,
there's no telling what they'll do to us!

190
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,470
And of all people, we had to get caught...

191
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,620
by the White Hunter, Smoker!

192
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,960
Vice-admiral Smoker! 
Won't you give these guys to us?

193
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,400
P-Please don't!

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,250
We'll say who it was!  Spare us!

195
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,720
The ones who defeated Hody's crew...

196
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,320
were the Straw Hat Pirates!

197
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,860
I know,

198
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,690
idiot.

199
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,950
Madame Shyarly, Luffy-chin's crew is about to leave.

200
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,200
Are they now?  Go see them off.

201
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,570
Sure!

202
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,530
Madame!  Can we go too?

203
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,560
What, you all want to go?
Well, I guess I'll have to close the café for a while.

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,710
That idiot Hody was blocking our customers,
but they'll be back soon enough.

205
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,790
I hope you'll continue to make the café an enjoyable place to be, girls.

206
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,720
Leave it to us, Madame!

207
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,810
Oh, the crystal ball?

208
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,590
Never mind that.  I've had enough.

209
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,330
I will never predict the future again.

210
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,900
Straw Hat Luffy destroying Fishman Island...

211
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,690
I wish I'd never seen that horrible future.

212
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,700
It would be for the best if it turns out that the prediction was wrong.

213
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,430
She's never been wrong,
so she must be more scared than any of us.

214
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,970
There's no guarantee that a future she's seen
will occur immediately.

215
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,820
It could happen a year from now,
or it could take even longer.

216
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,290
There's no definite proof that she was wrong.

217
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,920
But you know, Madame,
Luffy-chin and his group would never-

218
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,730
Caimie.

219
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,080
Please forgive me for doubting your friends.

220
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,900
I understand now.  We can trust him, right?

221
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,070
We can trust the Straw Hat boy.

222
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,390
Yes!

223
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,260
This is all for you.  Please accept it!

224
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,980
Right, thanks!

225
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,020
Luffy-sama, are all of you leaving already?

226
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,890
We've only just become friends, at least stay one more day...

227
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,740
No, one more week...

228
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,080
No, just stay for one more year!

229
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,260
You kept crying
all the way to the very end, huh, Weak-Hoshi?

230
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,120
I-I'm so sorry!

231
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,600
I'll stop being such a crybaby.

232
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,580
The Mermaid Princess of Fishman Island...

233
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,370
is crying because we're leaving!
I never thought this day would come!

234
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,260
I really wish I could live here for a year!

235
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,990
I understand what you mean!

236
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,110
I've even made a new single
about the dreamlike life here on Fishman Island!

237
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Waking up with a Good Mor-ningyo!

238
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
{\an8}Ningyo: Mermaid

239
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,670
Oh, my dear mermaids!

240
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,670
What a fantastic idea.

241
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,530
By all means, stay here, Nosebleed-kun.

242
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,490
Who did you just call what, Moss-Head?!

243
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,740
Who're you calling Moss-Head?!

244
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,060
Your Majesty!

245
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,570
We really must tell them...

246
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,070
about how the Tamate Box they sent to Big Mom...

247
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,330
will explode if it's opened!

248
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,980
But...

249
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,270
look at them.

250
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:19,450
It's over.  One of the Four Emperors wants us dead.  We're just going to die in the New World.

251
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:26,390
Do you think Big Mom will forgive us
if we give her all the treasure we find from now on?

252
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,350
I just can't bring myself to tell them...

253
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,520
that they've already sent her a bomb!

254
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,940
But you know,
it's been ten years since you planted those bombs.

255
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,910
Isn't there a chance that
they may have become duds in that time?

256
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,000
That's right, Your Majesty, think positive!

257
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,580
There's a lot of moisture in Ryuuguu Palace, after all!

258
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,710
Besides, there's no guarantee that Big Mom will open it herself!

259
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,460
Then...

260
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,980
Let's pray that things work out!

261
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,940
What are you two whispering about?

262
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,040
Huh?

263
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,340
What's... this?

264
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,060
A Log Pose used in the New World.
Take it with you.

265
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,480
Trying to navigate with just a single compass needle...
What are we to do with you?

266
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,820
What's that?  A new Log Pose?

267
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,990
That's so cool!

268
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,640
It's got three needles!  Why?

269
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,780
Look at the Log you've used up till now.

270
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,830
It's moving back and forth!  I thought
the Log had adjusted itself to another island.

271
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,200
It has.  From now on,
the Log will only need half a day to readjust itself.

272
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,220
In the previous half of the Grand Line, the Log would adjust itself to the magnetic field of the next island,

273
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,350
and you could reliably continue your voyage.

274
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,080
But you're entering the second half now,

275
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,500
where, in addition to
changing sea currents and climate,

276
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,920
magnetic fields, the one thing you've been able to rely on until now, fluctuate as well!

277
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,980
The magnetic field of some islands might even disappear completely before you reach them!

278
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,080
What?!  But then we couldn't even reach the island!

279
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,620
That would be a disaster
if you only had one compass needle.

280
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,660
But what could you do if you had three?

281
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,150
One of them is shaking like our Log Pose...

282
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,550
but the other two seem to be stable.

283
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,380
The three compass needles
are all aligned to different islands' magnetic fields.

284
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,010
Meaning, you have three different routes
and you can choose the one that looks the safest.

285
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,590
Your decisions can mean
the difference between life and death!

286
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,490
Skilled navigators can look at the slight movements of the needles and figure out the safest route.

287
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,100
To put it simply,
the more unstable the compass needle is...

288
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,780
the more dangerous the island it points to.

289
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,410
It means that something intense enough to disrupt the island's magnetic field is occuring there.

290
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,520
Huh?!  No way!

291
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,880
We're better off not knowing!

292
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
It can tell how dangerous things are?!

293
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,180
We can't!  Destroy that Log Pose!

294
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,630
Why?  If you don't pick the safest route, you might...

295
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,130
Let's see...

296
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,510
O-Oh crap!

297
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,750
Noooooooo!

298
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,540
The island in the middle
with the really shaky needle looks fun!

299
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,040
H-H-He heard!

300
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,820
Luffy, you shut up!  I'll decide the route we'll take!

301
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,450
Don't be ridiculous!  I'm the captain!

302
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,740
Please, Captain!  Listen to what your navigator says!

303
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,840
Nami-san is so cute when she's scared!

304
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,330
So cute!  So cute!

305
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,330
The B-side of my single!  "Requiem For Us!"

306
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:59,510
Alright, guys!  The preparations are complete!

307
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,670
Den-san has taught me how to control our ascent.

308
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,890
Shall we go?

309
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,320
Alright!

310
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,530
Let's go!

311
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,830
Luffy-chin!

312
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,030
Straw!

313
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,810
I'm helping out with repairing the factory.

314
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,870
Will you be alright without a guide?

315
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,450
Sure!  Our adventures coming here were fun too.

316
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,100
Yeah, that's right!  We don't need a guide!

317
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,230
A true man's journey always leads straight into hell!

318
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,810
Yeah, that's right!  This is war, you bastards!

319
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,800
You're beginning to lose it.

320
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,570
Everyone, please come again!

321
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,970
I swear to return!

322
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,910
To the All Blue of my heart!

323
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,500
What a cheap dream you have.

324
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,260
What?!

325
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,790
All I have are words,
but I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

326
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,220
I will pray that your voyage is a safe one.

327
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,040
Thanks!

328
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,570
The next time we meet,
we'll be leading the greatest army on the ocean floor!

329
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,550
Mambo!

330
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:17,010
Indeed!  We will rewrite the legend of
the great Neptune Knights -mi fa so la ti do!

331
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,000
I look forward to it!

332
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,740
So, where is he?

333
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,550
Ah, there!

334
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,940
Jinbe!

335
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,580
You got it!

336
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,510
Alright, hoist the sails!

337
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,690
Time to set sail!

338
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,640
Straw Hat!

339
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,360
See you later, Fishman Island!

340
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,330
Come back whenever you want, to eat candy and meat!

341
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,660
I like humans now!

342
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,790
Oh, and raccoon dogs and robots too!

343
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,780
I'm not happy at all, you jerks!

344
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,680
Huh?  What?

345
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,590
What about bones?

346
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,250
Stay well!  Luffy-chin, everyone!

347
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,530
Come back for some more Takoyaki someday!

348
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,960
I love you guys!

349
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,380
Ready, and...

350
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,480
We like bones too!

351
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,940
Thank you for being so considerate!

352
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,310
Luffy-sama!

353
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,910
Weak-Hoshi!

354
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,890
Shirahoshi-chwan!

355
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,970
If we can ever... meet again...

356
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,240
then I...

357
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,820
won't be such a crybaby anymore!

358
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,910
Please take me for another fun walk!

359
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,790
A walk?  You wanna go visit your mom again?

360
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,100
No.

361
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,670
This time, I want to go even further!

362
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,110
To the real forests above the sea!

363
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,210
I see.  You've never left the sea, have you?

364
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,490
Okay, sure!

365
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,880
The next time we meet, I'll take you there!

366
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,010
Promise me!

367
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,940
Sure, you got it!

368
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,960
It's a promise!

369
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,180
Hey, Luffy!
Doesn't that put some responsibility on us too?

370
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,740
Luffy-san, promises are something you must keep,
even if it kills you!

371
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,680
Then, Shirahoshi, I promise too!

372
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,160
Nami-chin-sama!

373
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,470
Me too.

374
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,080
And me!

375
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,150
And me.

376
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,290
And me.

377
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,320
Of course I promise too!

378
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,510
If we all promise...

379
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,830
It should be alright.

380
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,820
It's a promise!

381
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,920
E-Everyone...

382
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,230
So don't cry any more!

383
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,750
Alright!

384
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,770
Never forget what they did for us.

385
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,900
Of course we won't!

386
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,840
Hey, Daddy!

387
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,850
Buy me a straw hat!  I wanna play hero!

388
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,040
What?  They only sell those on the surface!

389
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,870
Then go up there and buy one!

390
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,580
Don't be a fool!  The surface is where
the terrifying humans who hate fishmen...

391
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,560
What?

392
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,130
Uh, no.  There are guys like him too, after all.

393
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,330
Of course, there are plenty of strong,
kind-hearted people like Straw Hat up there too!

394
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,320
Boss Jinbe!  Perfect timing!

395
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,640
I couldn't help overhearing you.

396
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,830
I'll send a merchant ship to get some straw hats.

397
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,130
Really?!

398
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,230
Indeed.

399
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,350
It's the hat of a hero, after all!

400
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,450
Yeah!

401
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,010
That was the best!

402
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,360
Mermaid Paradise!

403
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,180
Now, everyone, you'd better quit slacking off!

404
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,910
Now that we're out in the sea,
there's no safe place anywhere!

405
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,500
We're gonna be passing through the dark sea again, after all.

406
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
What's that, Franky?

407
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,340
I'm making the ship rise by using
these cubes of highly buoyant taolfrepus wood.

408
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,230
I can regulate our speed
by adjusting how many are out in the water.

409
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,740
What is it, Luffy?

410
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,750
When we reach the surface...

411
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,540
we'll be in the same sea as Shanks!

412
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,470
I can't wait to see him!

413
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,340
Then...

414
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,310
I'll entrust you with this hat.

415
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,080
It's my precious hat.

416
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,750
Come return it to me some day,

417
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,260
when you've become a great pirate!

418
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,020
I only have... one regret. {Copy-paste from 483}

419
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,800
That I couldn't see you... fulfill your dream.

420
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,970
But... I'm sure...

421
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,720
you can make it.

422
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,880
You're my little brother. {End copy-paste from 483}

423
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,470
Don't just count everything you've lost! {Copy-paste from 505}

424
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,320
What's gone, is gone!
But ask yourself this, what remains?!{End copy-paste from 505}

425
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,370
Keep going all the way to the top! {From 522.}

426
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:22,100
Luffy-san, do you know what they call the second half of the Grand Line?

427
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,300
The final ocean that stretches out
on the other side of the Red Line...

428
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,260
People call it by another name...

429
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,070
The New World!

430
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,240
The New World?

431
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,000
The ocean that beckons
those who'll forge a new era.

432
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,800
The one who conquers that ocean becomes the Pirate King!

433
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,940
Once we make it to the surface...

434
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,550
we'll be in the world's strongest sea!

435
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,870
Finally!  I'll cut down anything in our way!

436
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,300
Wait for me, Laboon!  I'm halfway there!

437
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,040
Sure, I'll take you anywhere!

438
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,630
That's right!  The Sunny can make it!

439
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,410
Nobody has to worry about getting hurt!

440
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,040
Eat as much as you want, it won't bother me!

441
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,630
There's a warrior of the sea on this ship!

442
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,350
Let's go!

443
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,940
You guys!

444
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,890
To the New World!

445
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,410
Aye!
