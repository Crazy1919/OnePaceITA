00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,340
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,640
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,380
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,870
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,320
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,820
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,490
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,070
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

Forget our worries, just let the wind blow.

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm sure we'll be the first to find One Piece!

so let's never wake them up.

One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,720
We... made it this far.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,620
We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,720
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610
The sun in my heart will never set!

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,820
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,030
We Go!

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,590
A creature with no bones... A skeleton with no flesh...

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,090
It appears to be my polar opposite.

46
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,430
No one cares!

47
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,720
You're pretty good.

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Well, you don't see something like this every day.

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,920
You're just calmly sketching it?!

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,570
That sounds fine by me,
but do you have a plan, Luffy?

51
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,660
The problem is that we're underwater.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,330
No... No... No...

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,550
The problem is how big it is.

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,100
Even if we were on the surface, it'd still be just as dangerous.

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,400
What's wrong with these people?!

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,540
In a situation like this, it's only natural
that everyone would work together to escape!

57
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,750
Turn the rudder!  Set a course due south!

58
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Hey, Nami!  Head straight for the octopus!

59
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,570
Don't be ridiculous!  That octopus is-

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,570
Now, now, Nami-san.

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,620
I'm here...

62
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,660
for you.

63
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,550
He withstood it!  Great job!

64
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,100
It's because of his rehabilitation,
and because Nami's wearing a coat!

65
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,100
This ship is dangerous!  I have to save myself! { def: madhouse instead of dangerous? }

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,340
Something's approaching from behind.

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,200
Bro!

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,240
That's the ship from before!

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,750
Coribou!  You guys!

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,680
You came back to save me?!

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,080
We're gonna save ya, Bro!

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,650
Aye!

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,080
No!

74
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,460
The soap bubble coating broke!

75
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,170
And that ship was even bigger than the Sunny!

76
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,410
You guys...

77
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,440
They look like jellyfish.

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,750
Shut your trap, Roronoa!

79
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,000
It's heading straight for us!

80
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,390
It's way too big!

81
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,580
Gear Thir-

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,800
Stop it!

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,490
If you perform any big attacks, the soap bubble will break!

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,150
Chicken Voyage!

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,180
We have to do something!  Can't we run away?!

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,740
Don't do anything!  I'm gonna fight him!

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,940
Don't do it!  You'll break the soap bubble!

88
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,580
Listen to me!  If you want to fight that badly,
I've got an idea.

89
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,050
Right, that's good.

90
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,390
This is the instant Flutter Kick Coating!

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,250
An instant diving suit!

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,490
If I just left these imbeciles to their own devices,
I'd suffer with them.

93
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,910
What'd you do that for, outsider?!

94
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,310
We should be running away!

95
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,470
Now we'll end up fighting, won't we?!

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,440
I've been saying we should run from the start but
that stupid captain of yours doesn't listen, does he?

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,040
Would you rather he went wild while
he was still on the ship?!{ tlc: "Would you rather it went wild while we were still on the ship?!" makes it easier to understand }{ def: that changes the meaning quite a bit, the original makes more sense to me }

98
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,150
Alright, get going!  As far from the ship as you can!

99
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,780
If you're gonna fight him,
then get away from the ship!

100
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,280
This rope is in the way.

101
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,640
Wait!

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,920
You need to keep the lifelines attached!

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,420
Otherwise we'll get separated!

104
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,000
Nami-san is worried about me!

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
You guys!  Buy me some time, will you?

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,630
I'm gonna take him out with one powerful blow.

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,810
I'll just take care of him while you're getting ready.

108
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,870
You'd kill him, so no!

109
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm gonna keep that octopus!

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,380
It's still coming for us!

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,050
Franky...

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,120
Rocket Launcher!

113
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,000
You got him!

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,540
It's so powerful!

115
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,230
Here comes another arm!

116
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,880
Why is it only attacking us?!

117
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,060
Guard Point!

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
That was a direct hit!

119
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,340
Are you alright?!

120
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,740
Y-You stopped it!

121
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,880
Well done!

122
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,280
That was amazing, Chopper!

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,150
Now we're gonna crash into an underwater mountain!

124
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,480
Mille Fleur...

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,480

Alright!

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,670
Great job, Robin!  You saved us!

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
What a relief...

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,740
Even though we're underwater,
I was still able to pull it off for a moment.

133
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,200
Gear Third!

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,540
Color of Arms Hardening!

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,990
The ocean is... sapping my strength.

136
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,690
Damn octopus, are you trying to stop him
before he lands a single hit?

137
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,290
Blue Walk!

138
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,390
Sanji-san left his soap bubble!

139
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,670
Never mind that!  Look at his speed!

140
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,050
He's like a fishman!  Amazing!

141
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,520
Running!  Running!

142
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,320
I spent two years running from revolting creatures.

143
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,350
Compared to them,
this thing barely even qualifies as a monster.

144
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,130
It's almost cute.

145
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,890

149
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,060

150
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,550
Secret Three Swords Style Technique...

151
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,090
Crossing of the Six Paths!

152
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,880
A-Amazing...

153
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,090
I couldn't even see his swordplay!

154
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,490
Hey, Zoro, Sanji!  You're destroying all of its arms!

155
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,750
Rubber...

156
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,610
Elephant Gun!

157
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,600
He knocked it out!

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,370
Just how strong has he become?!

159
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,200
Huh?  There's something there!

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,190
Huh?

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
A shark?

162
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,100
A shark?

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,280
Is that shark wearing clothes?

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,430
That's a pretty big shark.

165
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,870
What's going on?

166
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,310
They've been sucked into the downflow!

167
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,630
Crap, after them!

168
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,230
We have to stay together!

169
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,990
I don't wanna die here!

170
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,190
Stop messing around!

171
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,760
Hmm?  That guy's still here?

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Why are you so calm?!

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,340
My eyes are spinning!  Though I have no eyes.

174
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,950
Keep the yard level!  Steer the ship to the left!

175
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,510
We're going to crash into the continental shelf!

176
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,020
Alright!

177
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,730
If we're not careful, the ship will be destroyed!

178
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,060
Whaaaat?!

179
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,730
Don't get thrown off!

180
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,550
Bring the ship to the center of the current!

181
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,360
We're going so fast!

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Usopp.

183
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,400
Ow, that hurts.

184
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,810
So I'm still alive?

185
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,120
What's wrong?  Why the long faces?

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
I swear, you really are helpless without me.

187
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,590
It's so cold here!

188
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,470
We can't find Luffy and the others.  It looks like we got separated.

189
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,920
What?!

190
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,640
I just hope they haven't been
torn to pieces by a sea monster.

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,670
Your imagination is too scary.

192
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,800
Still, we won't find them in this darkness,
no matter how hard we look.

193
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,830
I do not like the darkness...
Do any of you feel like we're being watched?

194
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,570
We're probably at least
7 kilometers down by now.

195
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,490
At this depth, the pressure would even flatten the Shark Submerge like a pancake.

196
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,030
Are we near Fishman Island?

197
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,830
Maybe they're already there?

198
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,810
I think Caimie-chan said
it's 10 kilometers beneath the surface.

199
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,490
We still have to dive another 3 kilometers?!

200
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,820
They're only protected by those small soap bubbles.

201
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,840
Even if they're still alive, they'll run out of air soon!

202
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,210
This is why I told them to keep the lifelines attached!

203
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,430
Crying about it won't get us anywhere.

204
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,610
Let's look for them.  I have a light function installed.

205
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,450
Huh?!

206
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,840
Do you mean your eyes?!

207
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,350
Franky...

208
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,020
Nipple Light!

209
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,980
Why would you install lights there?!

210
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,600
These are the deepwater levels. Where the light cannot reach, and ordinary creatures cannot hope to survive.

211
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,420
A true ocean "Underworld".

212
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,420
{\an8}Let's get out of here!

213
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,330
Luffy!  Zoro!  Sanji!

214
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,850
Where did you go?

215
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,710
Come back!

216
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,950
The range of the Sunny Eyes
isn't all that long to begin with.

217
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,190
How disheartening.

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,120
This darkness makes it even more depressing.

219
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,530
This isn't getting us anywhere.

220
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,560
What should we do?

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,540
We can't slow the ship down,
so make sure you don't miss anything.

222
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,410
A jellyfish!  There's a huge jellyfish above us!

223
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,880
It's huge!

224
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,650
It really is massive!

225
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,620
It's sparkling!  It looks like a starry night sky!

226
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,490
Its hand entered!

227
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,220
D-Does it want to be friends with me?

228
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,010
You mustn't touch it, Chopper!

229
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
It's probably poisonous!

230
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
Huh?!

231
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,580
Not good!

232
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,130
Small Coup De Burst!

233
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,110
What?!

234
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,480
The jellyfish was eaten!

235
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,760
The ship seems to have lost some air.

236
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,610
It's better than being eaten, isn't it?

237
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,660
The Coup de Burst is a weapon that uses large amounts of air.

238
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,050
However, we're underwater.  Our air is limited!

239
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,090
If we shoot air out, the soap bubble shrinks!

240
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,030
The fish that attacked the jellyfish went belly up!

241
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,060
Neurotoxin, as I suspected.

242
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,690
The deep sea is so scary!  And dark.

243
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,890
And there are so many fish
with white eyes.  They're creepy!

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,370
The deep sea is a world of darkness.  Thus,
the eyes of many creatures here have degenerated.

245
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,950
Oh, so they can't see very well?

246
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,490
Stupid!  Try to come over here!

247
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,990
What?  How can I see with no eyes, you ask?

248
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,220
On the other hand,
some creatures will have highly evolved eyes.

249
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,410
The answer is...

250
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,970
It's a secret!

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,290
What are you doing over there, all by yourself?

252
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,280
No need to worry.  I am quite used to solitude.

253
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,920
Luffy, Zoro, Sanji!

254
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,750
Where did you go?

255
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,920
Hmm?

256
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,140
These ropes...

257
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,160
Everyone?

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,330
Huh?

259
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,620
Do you know what happened to that pirate fellow?

260
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh yeah, he was here too.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,940
I'd completely forgotten.

262
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,420
Where did he go?

263
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,450
I haven't seen him since we reached the deep sea.

264
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,690
Maybe he got thrown off in the downflow?

265
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,040
That could be.
His hands and legs were bound, after all.

266
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,880
He couldn't hold on to anything.

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,270
No, you see...

268
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,990
It seems his ropes came off.  Look.

269
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,190
T-Then he's still onboard?

270
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,840
Where could he be?!

271
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,110
He could be lurking inside the ship somewhere.

272
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,590
If you want me to lurk around then maybe I should.

273
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,400
Like in the ladies' quarters?

274
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,880
Damn... So we can't even
drop our guard on our ship?

275
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,050
Don't worry.  He's not all that strong, anyway.

276
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,140
This is great!

277
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,690
The monster trio who fought the Kraken
have gone missing!

278
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,610
They're dead for sure after getting lost down here in such small bubbles!

279
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,370
It's a shame I couldn't take Straw Hat's head, but...

280
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,780
as long as I collect
the heads of everyone on this ship,

281
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,450
that should be more than enough proof
that Straw Hat is dead!

282
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,780
However, don't be hasty, Caribou!

283
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,560
You mustn't act too quickly!

284
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,130
If you kill them now there will be nobody to sail the ship.

285
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,800
These guys are skilled at navigating the sea.

286
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,100
But the moment when we reach Fishman Island...

287
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,260
will be their last!

288
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,070
Here he is!

289
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,570
Dammit!

290
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,590
Now we'll be safe.

291
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,590
I screwed up!

292
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,630
How did he get inside this small barrel?

293
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,490
We were careless.  We might have been in trouble
if this guy wasn't such an idiot.

294
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,290
His body lost its form and became a muddy substance.

295
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,790
He's a devil fruit user, no doubt about it.

296
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,160
What's more, he's a Logia.

297
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,770
He took our attacks on purpose earlier, and pretended he'd been captured.

298
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,200
Hey!  Please let me out, master!

299
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,480
Master with the speedo!  I'll be your servant!

300
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,870
What is it, Chopper?

301
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,470
I don't know, it got really hot all of a sudden.

302
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,140
I can't handle heat.

303
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,160
So hot!  What's going on?!

304
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,220
Huh, what's this?  Smoke?

305
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,060
It's blocking our view!

306
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,900
Smoke from the ocean floor?  How?

307
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,130
This is...

308
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,950
Could it be?!

309
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,270
Hydrothermal deposits!

310
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,170
Huh?

311
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,440
This is a field of underwater volcanoes!

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,230
Look!  You can see that they were recently active.

313
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,080
We have to get out of here!

314
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,430
If one of them erupts, we'll die instantly!

315
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,830
Hot... so hot!

316
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,440
Something's coming after us!

317
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,260
A carnivorous tube worm!

318
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,230
Faceless crabs!

319
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,740
I have no idea what that is!

320
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,770
Small...

321
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,190
Coup de Burst!

322
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,880
The deep sea is scary!

323
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,810
There's no way Luffy and the others could survive down here.

324
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,790
I'm so sad.  We finally met after two years,
and now...

325
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,720
Don't be ridiculous!  They won't die that easily!

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,010
We used one Coup de Burst after another... There isn't much air left.

327
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,430
What's that?  It's so bright!

328
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,660
Maybe it's Fishman Island!
Maybe Luffy and the others are there!

329
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,500
We haven't dived down 3 kilometers yet.

330
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,170
W-h-o a-r-e y-o-u?

331
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,980
Hey!  What are you sending those signals with?!

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
Can you see anything?

333
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,560
It's still too bright.

334
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,050
Oh no!

335
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,700
It's an angler!  It tricked us!

336
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,260
We've been caught by a deep sea hunter!
This is not good!

337
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,530
That was close!

338
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,600
It lured us right into its trap!  Can we get away?

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
What is it now?!

340
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,050
A-A human?!

341
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,050
What is that?!

342
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,290
A sea monster with the shape of a human!

343
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,190
A Sea Bonze!

344
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,880
He's gonna capsize the ship!

345
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,630
The fish?!

346
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,770
Hey!  Angler!  You can't do that!

347
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
No eating ships!

348
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,410
How many times do I hafta tell ya?

349
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,680
Captain Vander Decken's gonna yell at ya!

350
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,250
D-Did he just save us?

351
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,740
L-Let's get out of here!  Who cares what happened?

352
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,190
Both of them are monsters!

353
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,970
Dead men tell no tales and know no greed. {Gil: Going for the English idiom here, since it seems to hold the same meaning.}

354
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,970
Is that...

355
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,760
In this country so black that even crows don't fly,

356
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,610
...me?

357
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,150
What is that?!

358
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,990
the dead need no jewels upon their fingers.

359
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,040
They can't even see their own regrets in the darkness.

360
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:23,180
Search for it!  Search for it!
All sunken treasure belongs to me! { def: originally "Search!  Search!  The sunken treasures belongs to me!" from manga: "So, a-huntin'! Go a-huntin'! For the deep, deep treasure troves" }

361
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,730
I am the world's richest man, Captain Vander Decken!

362
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,170
It can't be...

363
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,980
Even at the bottom of the sea?!

364
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,500
Nooooooooooo!

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,170
It's a ghost ship!

366
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,410
Why are you getting scared?!

367
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,060
T-That is a real one!  Look at the sail!

368
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,680
That is the legendary Flying Dutchman!
It's a ship that shouldn't exist in this world!

369
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,550
There is a tale from many centuries ago.

370
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,920
One day, during a storm,

371
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,560
the captain of a ship suddenly went insane.

372
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,830
He started throwing his crewmates
into the stormy sea, killing them one after another.

373
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,570
He even spat in the face of God!

374
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,290
The name of that captain was Vander Decken!
And the name of the ship was The Flying Dutchman!

375
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,320
He incurred the wrath of God,

376
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,330
and now he's cursed to drift through the seas,
tortured for all eternity!

377
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,640
The ship we see before us is the very same cursed ship of Captain Vander Decken!

378
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,010
Angler!  Wadatsumi!  If you eat the ship, I won't be able to take their treasure!

379
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,810
Smash it!

380
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
Gotcha!

381
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,760
Wah! The Sea Bonze...

382
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,100
So it's an enemy after all!

383
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,420
Franky!  Use the Coup de Burst!

384
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,100
I can't!  We're all out of fuel!

385
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,200
We have to refill the cola in the energy room!

386
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,760
The Kraken?! { def: lol, the Kraken punches people? }

387
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,580
The beast of the North Pole, the Kraken.

388
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,210
Ya bastard! {Gil : Mudamudamudamudamudamudamudada! Za Warudo!}

389
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,350
Hey, that's enough!

390
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,040
Cut it out!

391
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,030
You did great!

392
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,270
Heeeey!

393
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,450
Luffy!  Zoro, Sanji!

394
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,570
I'm so glad you're alive!

395
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,240
Nami-swan!  Robin-chwan!

396
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,830
We've been looking for you guys!

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
They sure caused us a lot of trouble...

398
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,650
Getting separated from us...

399
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,950
Hey!  Wake up, Wadatsumi!

400
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,780
Time for a rematch!  Get them!

401
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,960
Me and Sanji's bubbles burst, so we got into Zoro's. { def: stuck with "Me" because it's the kind of mistake Luffy would make and correcting it makes Luffy sound too formal. willing to change it tho } {Gil: No, I tend to agree that "Sanji and myself", while ultimately correct, is rarely used correctly in informal conversation anyway. Particularly considering Luffy has no kind of formal education whatsoever, I can't help but feel this is better.}

402
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,710
We almost died!

403
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,700
Don't make us worry so much!

404
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,900
Finally some space!  Being at home really is the best!

405
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,300
Luffy!  I was so worried!

406
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,260
I'm impressed by your vitality!

407
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,870
Unbelievable!  You actually tamed it?!

408
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,950
That monstrous octopus?!

409
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,530
That's right!  I'm using him to travel like a pro!

410
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,640
Isn't that right, Surume?

411
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,930
Why'd you give him a squid name?!

412
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,600
He isn't exactly "pulling" the ship though.

413
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,640
I just hope he's careful that he doesn't crush us.

414
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,140
What's going on?

415
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,310
Huh?!

416
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,880
This is bad, Captain Vander Decken!

417
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,260
Not good!  The underwater volcanoes...

418
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,950
are erupting!
