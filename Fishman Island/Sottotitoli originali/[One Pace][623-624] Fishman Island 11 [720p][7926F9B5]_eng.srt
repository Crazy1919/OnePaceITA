1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,390
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,940
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,300
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,450
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,820
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,850
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:39,180
{\an5}The Shocking Truth of Tiger!
The End of the Sun Pirates

10
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,250
We finally got an Eternal Pose pointing toward Koala's homeland.

11
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,130
Nyuu- Koala, you can return to your homeland! {Gil : Maybe a little early on the timing cut-off at the scene transition?}

12
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,180
Uh... Um...

13
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,280
You sure have changed.  I barely recognized you.

14
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,760
You've become a lot more feminine.

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm not used to...

16
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,330
What?  We finally got you some proper clothes,
but you don't like them?

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,830
We even gave you a haircut.
I'm sure your mother will like it better like this.

18
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,170
I...

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
I have to clean.

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,090
Nyuu- you've gotta get rid of
your habit of working whenever you're distressed!

21
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,590
This isn't Mariejoa, you know!

22
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,000
Let her do what she wants.

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,510
Nyuu?

24
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,020
Let her take her time.  Recovering from a trauma isn't that easy.

25
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,640
Really?

26
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,810
Sounds like you understand it well, Brother Aladdin.

27
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,150
Former slaves understand each other.

28
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,630
But you still want to kill her, don't you?  Right now?

29
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,950
She's a human, just like those who enslaved you!

30
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,410
Stop it, Arlong.

31
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,750
Show us your true nature!
What did your mother teach you?

32
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,500
Your parents look down on fishmen, right?

33
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,800
That's how the human society is, right?!

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,780
They think that humans are
the greatest species in the world!

35
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,570
The children hear this from their parents
and take it to heart!

36
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,010
Unless someone uses force to stop it,
this cycle will never end!

37
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,260
You've all seen them many times during our three year voyage, haven't you?

38
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,060
Those conceited, scornful looks that humans give us!

39
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,320
Who knows what I'd have done
if the Boss hadn't been around.

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,730
Only a small percentage of the humans scorn us.

41
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,260
The rest looked different to me.

42
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,370
Brother Jinbe...

43
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,950
From what I could see, they were all terrified of us.

44
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,600
Is it because we're pirates?

45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,640
Why are you so afraid?

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,060
Because...

47
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,310
we don't know anything about you.

48
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,690
You fear the unknown?

49
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,880
We are biased because we only come into contact
with certain kinds of humans. {Copy-paste from 540}

50
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,430
We still do not know anything about them.{End copy-paste from 540}

51
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,110
If we knew each other better, would things change?

52
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,790
Nyuu- look at this, Koala!

53
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,220
Try to guess which hand I've got this in!

54
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,700
So, where is it?

55
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,130
Uh... This one.

56
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,800
Wrong!

57
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,190
Koala, come down.  We've reached your homeland.

58
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,820
Where is your village?

59
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,630
Huh?

60
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,220
I'll walk you to the entrance.

61
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,200
Sure!

62
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't go, Koala!
Let's go on more adventures together!

63
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,920
You're such a good girl, even if you are human!

64
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,460
Don't cry, you guys!

65
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,220
I'll tell everyone in my village...

66
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,100
that there are many kind-hearted fishmen!

67
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you, everyone!

68
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,350
Good bye!

69
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,950
Take care of yourself!

70
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,740
When she grows up,
that kid will be just like all the other humans.

71
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,760
What's that supposed to mean, you bastard?!

72
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,740
Jinbe.

73
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
Arlong, you...

74
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,150
Brother Jinbe,

75
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,950
you've changed a lot in these past three years.

76
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,910
What?

77
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,460
Think about it.

78
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,640
What difference does it make if one person from that village preaches that fishmen are good people?

79
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,720
It'll be just like Otohime's preaching.
Her words will go in one ear and out the other.

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,790
I am Rear Admiral Strawberry, from Navy HQ.

81
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,700
We received a tipoff from a certain island that you would come here.

82
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,330
The adults in the village you just visited were informed that there might be a small commotion out here.

83
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,000
They accepted it...

84
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,280
so that we would let that girl stay
even though she belongs to the Celestial Dragons.

85
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,350
Captain of the Sun Pirates, Fisher Tiger!

86
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,320
You are guilty of two crimes.

87
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm sure that you know what they are.

88
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,400
Raiding and desertion. { def: i assume "desertion" as in a runaway slave.  desertion is usually a military term... but i can't think of a more appropriate word.  truancy? } {Gil : The crime of being a fugitive? Fugitivity? Is that a fucking word?}

89
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
Were those gunshots?

90
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,590
They came from where the Boss went!

91
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,570
Something might have happened to the Boss.

92
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,230
Hey, look at the sea!

93
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,260
It's the Navy!  We've been surrounded -chuu!

94
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,220
Why is the Navy here?

95
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,070
We've been set up!

96
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,370
That kid was bait, planted by the Navy!

97
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,620
This means that Brother Ti and the rest of us
have fallen into their trap!

98
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,920
Open your eyes!  This is what humans are like!

99
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,350
Damn Navy!

100
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Boss!  Boss Ti is in danger!

101
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,700
Arlong!

102
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,570
Hmm?

103
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,290
I'll let you handle this!  We'll go and help the Boss!

104
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,360
Sure, Brother Jinbe!

105
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,530
You'd better bring Big Brother back safe,
or I won't go easy on you!

106
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,410
Of course I will!  Let's go!

107
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,700
Yeah!

108
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,830
Arlong-san, it's hopeless!  The ship won't hold!

109
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,830
Abandon ship!

110
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,610
We're going to steal one of the Navy boats!

111
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,730
What's with his endurance?!

112
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,020
Why won't he go down
even after getting shot so many times?!

113
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,070
Unforgivable.

114
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,270
Unforgivable!

115
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,360
I will never forgive you for this, humans!

116
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,030
Fire.

117
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,620
Do you hear something, Mommy?

118
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,750
No.

119
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,630
Boss...

120
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,340
Boss!

121
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,760
Rear Admiral!  The Sun Pirates are here!

122
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,440
So that's him?  The infamous...

123
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,030
Jinbe?

124
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,270
Guys... forgive me.

125
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,150
Boss!

126
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,820
So you're the one responsible?!

127
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,930
This is for the sake of justice.
For the eradication of the Sun Pirates!

128
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,530
Damned Navy!

129
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,770
I'll take your head as well!

130
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,640
Go ahead, if you can!

131
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,720
We managed to rescue the Boss,
and finally escaped on a ship that Arlong had seized.

132
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,810
However...

133
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,150
Boss!

134
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,980
You refuse to accept a blood transfusion?!  Boss, what are you saying?!

135
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,450
You've lost too much blood!
If you don't get a transfusion soon, you'll...

136
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:37,330
You have a rare blood type!
No one in the crew is a match!

137
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,730
But... the blood reserves on this Navy ship...

138
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,400
are human... blood, right?!

139
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,470
That's right!  We have the same kind of blood as the humans!

140
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,970
We can use human blood!  You can still be saved!

141
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,390
So let's hurry and start the...

142
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,100
Don't!

143
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,060
I don't want to survive
with that kind of blood in my veins!

144
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,060
It's filthy blood!

145
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,410
The blood that has continued to scorn us fishmen!

146
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,540
Boss...

147
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,660
I will not be indebted to them!
I will not accept pity from them!

148
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,880
I will not succumb to the humans!

149
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,340
Big Brother!  What happened
between you and the humans?!

150
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,770
I didn't want... to tell you.

151
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,300
On my... last journey...

152
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,870
Your journey was quite long this time. {Copy-paste from 540}

153
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,810
Yeah.  A lot of things happened.

154
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,200
You... What did you see on your latest voyage?

155
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,220
Humans. {End copy-paste from 540}

156
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,490
Shortly after I departed...

157
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
I was imprisoned!

158
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,260
I spent several years in Mariejoa.

159
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,510
I was...

160
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
a slave!

161
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,060
What?!

162
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,070
Boss...

163
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,910
What I saw there was the madness of humankind.

164
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,820
I managed to escape with my life intact...

165
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,090
but I couldn't just ignore
all the other slaves I had seen.

166
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,790
Listen closely.

167
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,770
I've lived my life as I pleased...

168
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,950
and as a result...
I've severely hindered Queen Otohime's efforts.

169
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,230
But she... is right.

170
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,620
Anyone can see that peace would be for the best!

171
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,180
But... the only ones who can truly change our island...

172
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,870
are those like Koala.
The next generation, who don't know anything.

173
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,140
So, I beg of you!

174
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,750
Don't tell the people on our island anything!

175
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,800
Not about the tragedy that befell us,
nor about our anger toward the humans.

176
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,930
But, Big Broth-

177
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,390
Arlong!

178
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,020
There are...
plenty of kind-hearted humans... in this world.

179
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,310
We all know that.

180
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:59,740
And yet those of us who die only leave hatred in the world... Isn't that absurd?!

181
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,970
Even if I know it in my head...

182
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,280
there's a demon inside my heart...

183
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,250
that stops me!

184
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,300
My body rejects that blood!

185
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,360
I...

186
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,900
can no longer love the humans!

187
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,310
Boss!  Please don't say that!  Live!

188
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,440
Please!  You can still survive!

189
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Boss!  No matter what you say,
in the eyes of all the slaves you freed,

190
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,950
you are their savior!

191
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,750
You're the hero of the fishmen, who accomplished so much!

192
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm glad you think so.

193
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,170
You still have a long way to go.

194
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,040
What?!

195
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,510
Your moves are too soft.
With such a weak punch, you can't protect anyone.

196
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,380
Protect?!

197
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,760
Brother!

198
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,770
If nobody else wants to challenge me, then I will be the boss of the Fishman District from this day on!

199
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,810
I am Tiger!

200
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,180
Now that I am your leader, you may rest assured!

201
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,410
Your lives are my life!

202
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,370
I will protect my underlings!

203
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,340
Boss!

204
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:50,190
Boss!

205
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,660
I will never forgive this!

206
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,370
Prepare yourself!

207
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,510
You're that fishman-

208
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,380
You're really noisy.

209
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,390
So you're Arlong?

210
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,650
Why did you come back?

211
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,440
So recklessly... { def: originally "Just casually" } {Gil : nokonoko = without a care, unconcerndly. Either is good IMO.}

212
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,870
coming back to this place.

213
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,420
I came to slaughter the humans who shot Big Brother Ti!

214
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm going to go to the island that sold us out too!

215
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,550
So this is your retaliation?

216
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,770
That's right!  Fisher Tiger died!

217
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,800
You inferior scumbags killed him!

218
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,850
Oh, really?  So he's dead?

219
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,630
Either way, you'll be coming with me.

220
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,960
Fisher Tiger's death outraged Arlong,

221
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,790
so he bared his fangs toward the humans he resented...

222
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,030
and was captured.

223
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,750
If the transfusion hadn't been refused, he could have survived!

224
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,830
If we'd had access to fishman blood, Fisher Tiger wouldn't have died!

225
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,880
You humans drove him to his death!

226
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:53,580
"After being refused a blood transfusion by humans,
Fisher Tiger, captain of the Sun Pirates, died."

227
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,660
It's not too far from the truth.

228
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,440
It was the humans' fault that he died, after all.

229
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,900
Arlong lied to the Navy.

230
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,190
The truth was much more cruel.

231
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:15,330
Resenting the humans that betrayed him,
the hero Tiger refused to have their blood in his veins.

232
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,770
Not to mention his past as a slave.

233
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,010
If the world found out about that, it would damage the Boss's honor.

234
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,280
Arlong would never reveal that.

235
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,550
Nyuu- Captain Jinbe!

236
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,050
Enemy ship sighted!

237
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,890
Even if the Boss is gone, we cannot turn back now!

238
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,300
Prepare for battle!  But remember, don't kill anyone!

239
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,530
Yeah!

240
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,020
I became known as Sea Knight Jinbe,

241
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,680
captain of the Sun Pirates.

242
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,180
I devoted myself to never-ending battle.

243
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,250
"I am writing this to you...

244
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,670
because I feel you deserve to know the whole truth."

245
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,640
"Captain of the Sun Pirates, Jinbe."

246
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,560
I've made up my mind.

247
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,560
So Tiger was forced to choose the path he took -jamon.

248
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,030
Now I understand the scream I heard from his heart that day.

249
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,370
I will be alright.  I will not lose!

250
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,620
We must live beneath the sun!

251
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,550
The day when we and the humans understand each other will definitely come!

252
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,270
Sign this form!  Declare your wish to emigrate, here!

253
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,400
I can't!  It's impossible, Otohime-sama!

254
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,000
Tiger-san saved all the slaves,
he didn't discriminate by race...

255
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,390
but then the humans simply abandoned him!

256
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,940
Just how are we supposed to understand one another?!

257
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,990
Not a single signature today, either.

258
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,810
Mother!

259
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,450
My children!

260
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,280
Mother, are you alright?

261
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,230
Are you alright?  Are you alright?

262
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,710
She's completely worn out.

263
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,390
Ah, my oasis of peace.

264
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,550
I am alright!

265
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,970
Mother.

266
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,770
Mother!

267
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,480
Let us make a promise...

268
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,900
for your future.

269
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,700
Day after day, Queen Otohime ran herself ragged.

270
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,030
Rescuing the victims of shipwrecks.

271
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,090
Hang in there!

272
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,790
Pirates again?

273
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,880
Help us.

274
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,980
Of course we will!

275
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,590
Let us carry them to the island!

276
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,760
Teaching the children of the island about the surface world.

277
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,770
This is a forest, the place I told you about yesterday where lots of trees grow together.

278
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,160
Forest?  The Sea Forest?

279
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,330
Collecting signatures.

280
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,370
Wait!

281
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,430
It will only take a second!

282
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,370
However...

283
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,950
Queen Otohime.

284
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,370
Oh!  It's you!

285
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,820
You're all people who have signed the form, right?

286
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,910
Today, we've got a favor to ask.

287
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,420
How many signatures have you gathered?

288
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,520
I have spent five years collecting these.

289
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,030
There are ten signatures on each sheet...

290
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,170
and I have about a hundred of them.

291
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,450
So one thousand supporters.

292
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,440
Fishman Island has five million people
so I was hoping for more, but...

293
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,460
Uh, we have a selfish request to make.

294
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,970
We want to withdraw our signatures,
which works out at about fifty of your sheets.

295
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,750
Haven't you heard?
Pirates came to the island the other day.

296
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,560
They plundered the town and fled the island.

297
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,830
Otohime-sama...

298
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,770
Otohime-sama!

299
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,620
Oh, children.  Have you come to hear more stories about the surface world?

300
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,820
Well... This paper I signed the other day.

301
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,040
Mom said to. {Gee, thanks a lot for finishing your sentences.}

302
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,450
Mom said to! {And you too.}

303
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,620
What is it?

304
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,500
I did as you asked because you're the queen, but...

305
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,960
The humans are the problem.

306
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,300
We've had enough...

307
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,820
of your speeches, too.

308
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm tired of them.

309
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,450
Welcome home, Mother!

310
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,940
I gave it my all today as well!

311
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm home, my little angels!

312
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,530
I went a little overboard,
so can you leave me alone just for today?

313
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,170
Liars!  Every single one of you!

314
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,210
O-Otohime-sama!

315
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,650
You're broadcasting to the whole country!

316
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,410
Shaddup... ya damn Ministah of da Left!

317
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,180
You... Have you been drinking?!

318
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,110
Shaddup.  Ah ain't... Ah ain't drunk!

319
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,010
Yes, you are!

320
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,550
What's that?

321
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,650
Queen Otohime's voice?

322
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,990
Listen up, y'all!

323
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:01,530
We... We can live anywhere in the ocean.

324
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,470
In this vast, vast ocean.

325
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,740
On the dark, dark ocean floor.

326
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,350
Why do we all live in this one place? { def: random drunk-speak edits.  maybe we're better off without them } {Gil : Yeah, she doesn't sound quite so drunk by this point anyway.}

327
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,350
Otohime-sama...

328
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:29,840
Isn't it because there's a tiny bit of light and air here?

329
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,150
On the surface, the whole world is bathed in sunlight!

330
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,330
There is a vast sky above.

331
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:51,700
Why do children sneak out to look at Sabaody Park?

332
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,380
Out there in the world...

333
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,470
there are so many wonderful places!

334
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,590
We should be able to go to all of those places.

335
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:15,110
Aren't we just making up empty excuses,
and convincing ourselves that we should give up?!

336
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,650
Be brave...

337
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,280
and strive for the thing we all want the most!

338
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,640
Your Majesty.

339
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,690
If the humans are an obstacle standing in our way...

340
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,550
then let's overcome that obstacle together!

341
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,820
If we do, then maybe
the children living on Fishman Island today...

342
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,200
can change their future.

343
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,370
At least a little bit!

344
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,300
Have your wounds healed?

345
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,220
I ran into some serious trouble.

346
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,740
I never thought you'd get beaten this badly.

347
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,580
Arlong, who was imprisoned
in Impel Down the other day, was nothing.

348
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,060
The truly fierce one is Jinbe.

349
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,020
You don't see that kind of strength every day.

350
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,660
It's far too dangerous to let him roam free.

351
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,540
{\an8}Unclear Justice

352
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,890
Become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea?  Me?!

353
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,060
Your bounty's 250 million beli!

354
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:52,800
The Government must have realized that you'll become a huge threat to them if they don't do this!

355
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,270
So they're beginning to learn their lesson!

356
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,580
Just turn down their offer
and become even more notorious,

357
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,350
Captain Jinbe -chuu!

358
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,770
No, I plan to accept their offer.

359
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,300
Huh?!

360
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,990
I heard about the offer to join the Warlords.

361
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,380
If I join the Seven Warlords,
the Government will pardon my crew.

362
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,980
Aladdin and others who want to quit being pirates
will be able to live in this country in peace.

363
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:35,330
More importantly, if I accept this title, maybe fishmen can get a bit closer to joining the World Government.

364
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,110
For the sake of Her Majesty,
after I've caused her so much trouble.

365
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,450
Yes, and I'm grateful.

366
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,860
Though she's in a pretty bad way right now.

367
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,260
This is the late Tiger's wish.

368
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,770
I believe this is a step toward
the liberation and freedom of fishmen! {Gil : Literally "this will connect to..." as originally translated, but this is the implication.}

369
00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:01,150
However, there is
one worrisome detail regarding the pardon...

370
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,790
Arlong-san!

371
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,480
Arlong!

372
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,740
Arlong-san has returned!  He's back!

373
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,000
If there's something you want to say,
then spit it out, Arlong!

374
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,750
Joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea,
eh, Brother Jinbe?

375
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,210
In other words,
you're becoming a dog of the human Government!

376
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,550
Have you forgotten Brother Ti's words?!

377
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,050
Stop letting grudges and hatred control your life!

378
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,730
You've gotten soft, Brother.

379
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,300
I'm sure that becoming your underling would be the safest option for me,

380
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
but I'm not gonna do that!

381
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,470
Big Brother died!

382
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,070
I will be reforming my old Arlong Crew.

383
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,170
And I'll be taking my brethren with me.

384
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,870
This is farewell.

385
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,370
Arlong, you...

386
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,990
If you want to stop me that bad...

387
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,710
then this is your chance.

388
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,350
Just kill me!

389
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,760
A-Arlong-san!

390
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,290
If you can't, then that means I'm free!

391
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,480
I am the fury of fishmankind!

392
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,130
Enough of your insolence! {Gil : Worst. Animated. Fight scene. Ever.} { def: that's Jinbe's special poor-animation style }

393
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,430
Jinbe-san!

394
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,360
Fine by me!

395
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,840
Jinbe-san!

396
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,260
Stop this!

397
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,770
Don't let it get to you, Jinbe.

398
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,520
You grew up in the Fishman District together.
You're like brothers.

399
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,850
No matter what happens,
you wouldn't be able to kill him.

400
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,650
Why can't that fool understand...

401
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,230
Brother Ti's real intentions?!

402
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,960
It doesn't matter where he goes.
If he gets too violent, the Navy will take action.

403
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,420
But if they don't, and he does get out of control,
we'll go stop him ourselves.

404
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,060
For certain.

405
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:49,900
Sheesh!  We're also going back to
doing our own thing, Captain Jinbe.

406
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,620
Macro, you...

407
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,060
Let him do whatever he wants.

408
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,500
So long!

409
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,570
Damn, that freakishly strong bastard!

410
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,490
Hachi, let's go.

411
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,250
The Sun Pirates...

412
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,140
split into three groups,

413
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,410
and everybody went their own way.

414
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,420
A ship drifts to Fishman Island, carrying a shipwrecked Celestial Dragon,

415
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,260
who see fishmen as mere slaves.

416
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,180
Otohime decides to follow this Celestial Dragon up to the surface.

417
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,780
After her return, her dream is soon to be realized,

418
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,140
only to be shattered by a single gunshot.

419
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,740
Next time, on One Pace:

420
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,620
{\an5}The Shipwrecked Celestial Dragon!
A Bullet that Seals the Future
