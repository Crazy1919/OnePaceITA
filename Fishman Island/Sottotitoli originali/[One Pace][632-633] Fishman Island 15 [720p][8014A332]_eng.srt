1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,160
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,710
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,430
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,070
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,220
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,590
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,620
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,200
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,170
{\an5}Hody's Dark Secret!
The Straw Hats' Arrival

10
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,810
We're almost at the plaza.  Hurry, Megalo!

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Father...

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,500
Hey, it is me -jamon!

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,590
Boss Jinbe-sama!  Megalo!

14
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,390
Hey, it is me -jamon!

15
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,770
You're alright after all?

16
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,270
Father!

17
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,590
No way...

18
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,640
Our gallery has grown quite a bit.

19
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,220
You fiend!

20
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,940
Now, this is a nice view!

21
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,480
Prince Manboshi!

22
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Prince Ryuuboshi!

23
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Prince Fukaboshi!

24
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,360
What did those pirates do? {Literally "the subordinates of that pirate crew", but that strikes me as kind of redundant.}

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,700
The Princes were wiping the floor with them!

26
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,330
But then the situation suddenly turned on its head!

27
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,590
I haven't rampaged enough -zugon!

28
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,140
Muhi, you're too fired up!
You're gonna turn me into a grilled squid!

29
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,030
The army's soldiers, the ministers, and the Royal Family...

30
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,180
Now, there's nobody left in the country
who can fight us!

31
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,930
What outrageous power.

32
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,280
Please forgive me, Father.

33
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,200
Don't say that!  Their power isn't real -jamon!

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,780
But they can still use it
to take the country from us.

35
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,300
Captain Hody, let's execute them!

36
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,380
Roast them!

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,660
No, skewer them!

38
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,970
Those royals wanted to coexist with the humans!
They have no pride!

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,070
Give them a cruel death!

40
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,960
Put them up for display at the gallery!

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,460
Execute them!

42
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:39,090
Execute them!  Execute them!

43
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,870
Execute them!

44
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,180
Silence.

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,720
Decken's crew still haven't
sent word that Shirahoshi is dead.

46
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,490
If I can't lure her here, this will all be meaningless!

47
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,340
Keep your hands off our sister!  She's not a warrior!

48
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,000
What threat does she pose to you?!

49
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,620
Do you think I don't know?

50
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,530
The one I want to get rid of the most...

51
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,630
is the legendary mermaid,
who possesses that most troublesome power.

52
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,890
Hody!

53
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,720
Captain Hody!

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,810
We've caught them!

55
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,120
Princess Shirahoshi and Jinbe fell for our trap!

56
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,500
Shirahoshi!

57
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,320
Father!  Brothers!

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,900
What luck!

59
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,400
The two people I feared the most, captured at the same time!

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,840
This is almost too good to be true!

61
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,650
I really am so sorry.

62
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,600
Just because I fell for their trap, even you ended up...

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
What's done is done.  Don't worry about the past.

64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,390
So you came after all, Jinbe.

65
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,400
I used to like you,
back when you were more ruthless.

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,030
What happened to you, Hody?  You look different.

67
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,880
It's Boss Jinbe!

68
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,160
I thought he left the island after he resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

69
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,940
I heard that Princess Shirahoshi
had been kidnapped by Straw Hat Luffy...

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,550
Did Boss Jinbe rescue her?

71
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,040
Alright, we have everyone we need.

72
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,900
It was much easier than I thought it would be.

73
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,510
Now, the only ones left are the Straw Hats, and I don't know what they'll do.

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,030
I'm guessing that they're at a loss,
looking for a way inside Ryuuguu Palace.

75
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,200
Even if they come here,
enraged by the death of their companions...

76
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,790
we'll be ready for them. { def: is there a way to tweak this line to match his speech pattern? }

77
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:09,060
I've been capturing human slaves
on the ocean floor for the past month...

78
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,660
Thirty thousand of them! {...Seriously? THIRTY THOUSAND in the past month? Is he really saying that an average of a thousand people travel to Fishman Island daily? :/}

79
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,300
And heavily armed fishmen, all seventy thousand of them!

80
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,240
I-I can't believe this!

81
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,380
They've moved here from the closed-off Fishman District.

82
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:08,100
In all, we've got a hundred thousand outlaws!

83
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,670
There are some women and children around the plaza, but they can't fight.

84
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,930
We'll take care of them after things have settled down.

85
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,760
Of course, the number of human slaves
will rapidly grow soon!

86
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,810
But for now,
we have a hundred thousand new citizens!

87
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,060
The ones who have disgraced our species
will be forced to surrender their houses to you.

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,830
Die or run away... They should decide quickly!

89
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,860
You're causing quite a ruckus out here in public.

90
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,080
How undignified.

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,090
You shouldn't let yourself get carried away like this...

92
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,120
Hody Jones.

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,170
Long time, no see.

94
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,090
What do you want?

95
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,420
I'd like to say something to you,
since you seem to think you've already won.

96
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,810
Madame Shyarly.

97
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,360
I saw that a certain man
would destroy Fishman Island...

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,940
in my predictions.

99
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,570
We might end up destroying it.

100
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,320
So you saw me?

101
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,630
No.

102
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,910
The man I saw destroying the island...

103
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,650
was Straw Hat Luffy.

104
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,860
What are you trying to say?

105
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
That it won't be you!

106
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,240
One thing is certain...

107
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,750
Somebody holds the fate
of Fishman Island in their hands.

108
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,670
But Hody, I know this much...

109
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,380
It is not you.

110
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,060
I see!  Madame's predictions are never wrong!

111
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,220
In other words,
the future where Hody reigns over this island...

112
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,590
has no chance of happening!

113
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,030
Madame Shyarly!

114
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,390
Madame!

115
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,450
How could he?!

116
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,150
Ridiculous.  What were you implying, Shyarly?

117
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,200
Are you trying to get back at me?!

118
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm different from your brother.

119
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,660
True, when I was a kid, everyone in
Fishman District looked up to your brother, Arlong.

120
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,140
But we have gained power!

121
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:10,860
By now, the mark of the Arlong Pirates is just an empty symbol to unite us.

122
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,360
Arlong's name is completely unnecessary now!

123
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,870
The only one who can crush this country down to its foundation, and recreate it...

124
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,420
is me!

125
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,160
I have the power to do that!

126
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,370
Behold, the size of this mob!

127
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,570
This is my strength!

128
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,760
My plan has been in the works for ten years!

129
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,020
Shall I tell you...

130
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,140
who killed the beloved Queen of Ryuuguu Kingdom?

131
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,280
Your beloved Otohime was killed...

132
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,030
by me! {WHAT A TWEEST!!!}

133
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,500
What?!

134
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,090
Impossible!

135
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,760
Then...

136
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
what about that human?

137
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,590
You're fools for not realizing it!

138
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,350
A few days before that day ten years ago...

139
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,360
I don't know who you are,
but if the pay's good, I'll gladly take any job.

140
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,810
For real?!

141
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,950
That's half of your payment.

142
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,700
I'll give you the rest after you've finished the job.

143
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,620
Alright, I accept.

144
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,410
Even this is enough to keep me drinking for a while.

145
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,760
So?  What kind of job is it?

146
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,430
It's an easy job.  Even a kid could do it.

147
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,140
But you have to make sure that nobody notices you!

148
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,270
And then, on that day...

149
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,720
Get back!  They're going up in flames! {Copy-paste from 546. Just this line. For some reason the rest of them appear to be different from that episode...}

150
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,950
Put out the flames!

151
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,690
Run!

152
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,200
Protect the Royal Family!

153
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,230
Hurry and put out the flames!

154
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,150
Otohime-sama's been shot!

155
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,450
Hey!  Give me the rest of my money already!

156
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,950
I burned the signatures, just like I promised!

157
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,240
I won't bother you after this, so just give me the money!

158
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,070
What's going on?!

159
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,810
You foolish human.

160
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,220
Damn it... Damn it to hell!

161
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,770
A human... {Copy-paste from 547}

162
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,780
killed our country's queen!

163
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,100
Queen Otohime's killer was human! {End copy-paste from 547}

164
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,970
Hody, you filth!

165
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,110
Father!

166
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,380
Father!

167
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,580
Stop it, Hody!

168
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,850
Father!

169
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,300
She was quite a nuisance.

170
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,580
Right, Shirahoshi?!

171
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,430
Claiming that revenge against humans was evil...

172
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,940
Preaching all around the island
that we should get along with humans...

173
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,690
And that woman almost realized her dreams.
I hated every single thing about her!

174
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,910
No, she was the kind of person whose influence wouldn't fade even if I killed her!

175
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,120
But to me, your mother...

176
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,750
was someone who just had to die!

177
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,080
Stop!  Stop hurting the princess!

178
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,500
This is too cruel!

179
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,770
I knew.

180
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,980
Shirahoshi!

181
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,960
What?!

182
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,530
W-What?  What happened?!

183
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:58,100
My heartache from being rejected will never fade.

184
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,270
Wh-Wh-Wha?!

185
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,150
It started moving!

186
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,080
W-What's going on?

187
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,180
Run!

188
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,820
I sent Noah flying straight toward Shirahoshi!

189
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,180
Whaaaaat?!

190
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,530
Noah is half the size of Fishman Island itself!

191
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,370
Which means, if Noah collides with the island...

192
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,300
it won't just kill Shirahoshi,
it'll make the entire island crumble!

193
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,890
There is nowhere to run or hide!

194
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,510
Shirahoshi will live in my heart for all time!

195
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,580
May the entire island perish!

196
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,410
Farewell, my beloved Shirahoshi!

197
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,150
Farewell, Fishman Island!

198
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,560
You knew that I killed your mother?

199
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,950
What nonsense is this, Shirahoshi?!

200
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,920
Father!  Are you alright?

201
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,480
Hang in there!

202
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,100
Shirahoshi...

203
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,480
A few years after the incident, Megalo told me in secret.

204
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,320
Megalo?

205
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,800
Megalo used to be the pet of the Neptune Army.

206
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,150
He saw everything that happened that day.

207
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,680
In that case, why didn't you tell us,
Princess Shirahoshi?!

208
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,960
If I did...

209
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,650
people would probably end up hating Hody-sama.

210
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,670
If that happened, Mother would've been so sad.

211
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,320
It was the final promise I made with my mother.

212
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,310
Whoever the killer was...

213
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,450
We mustn't be angry and we mustn't hate them!

214
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,170
So, whoever the culprit is... {Copy-paste from 546}

215
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,710
please don't be angry for me.

216
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,270
Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me. {End copy-paste from 546... Also man what a bloody pointless flashback.}

217
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,390
Shirahoshi... You...

218
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,390
No way... So you...

219
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,730
In order to stay true
to Mother's wishes from ten years ago...

220
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,370
you've been bearing the weight of the truth
alone inside Koukaku Tower all this time?!

221
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,060
She doesn't resent the person who killed her mother?!

222
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:23,440
Even if it was her mother's dying wish, that's practically impossible!

223
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,210
What a respectful brave daughter!

224
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,350
Who else could do something like that?

225
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,430
Don't laugh, you scum!

226
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,750
How could I not laugh at this?!

227
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,020
Right, Megalo?

228
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,290
If you'd just attracted everyone's attention and raised the alarm when it happened,

229
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,610
you might have revealed that I was the assassin.

230
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,690
I'm amazed that you were able to stay silent.

231
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,830
And then you chose this boneheaded brat
to reveal the truth to!

232
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,140
Had you told anyone else,
my plans would have been ruined before they began!

233
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,080
Listen close, Shirahoshi.
In the real world, we call that "Idiocy".

234
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,980
Because you refused to hate me, this kingdom will fall.

235
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,820
Because of you...

236
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,690
your father, your brothers,
you, and your people will all die...

237
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,200
Shirahoshi!

238
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,820
He's wrong!  Don't listen to him, Your Highness!

239
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,860
What you did was not a mistake!

240
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,040
What else could it be?!

241
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,740
Your Highness!

242
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,220
Princes!

243
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,100
Stop!  Please stop this!

244
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Father!  Brothers!

245
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,820
How pathetic!

246
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
Hey, hand me a sword.

247
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,440
Jinbe and Shirahoshi, the two people
I was worried about, have been captured.

248
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,120
There's no reason to keep to the schedule anymore.

249
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,630
We will now commence the execution...

250
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,130
of these foolish Royals!

251
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,220
Do it!  Kill them!

252
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,100
Execute them!

253
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:16,670
Execute them!  Execute them!  Execute them!

254
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,700
The Great Knight Neptune... is really going to be killed!

255
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,890
This is hell on Earth!

256
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Our enemies are a hundred thousand outlaws...

257
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,950
This country is done for!

258
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,290
Madame Shyarly!

259
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,340
Children...

260
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,720
Hey...

261
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,740
That pirate with the hat...

262
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,720
When is he going to come and destroy the island?!

263
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,600
Huh?!  When?!

264
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't know.

265
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,980
My predictions only show what will happen...

266
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,020
It could be tomorrow, or a year from now.

267
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,070
I think he should do it now.

268
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,950
If he started wreaking havoc right now, we'd be in trouble...

269
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,000
but the bad guys would also be in trouble, right?!

270
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,980
I want him to come now too!  I don't want the King to die!

271
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,170
Me too!

272
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,800
The children are right.

273
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,600
I think it'd be for the best, too.

274
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,140
Yes... Yes...

275
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,990
Hey!  Straw Hat Luffy!

276
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,170
If you want to destroy the island, then come do it now!

277
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,040
Wreak havoc here, right now!

278
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,460
Yeah!  Can you hear us, Straw Hat?!

279
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,300
If you're still on the island, then come now!

280
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,090
Straw Hat!

281
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,000
Straw Hat!  Straw Hat!  Straw Hat!

282
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,160
Unbelievable.

283
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,780
They're literally clutching at straws!

284
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,920
Shyarly's predictions have always been accurate
but, just this once, it seems to have been a big lie.

285
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,020
Such futile shouts.

286
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,490
Time to drag those delusional fools back to reality.

287
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,100
Hear me, citizens!

288
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,830
Now, the former King Neptune's...

289
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,600
execution will commence!

290
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
Father...

291
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,360
Watch closely...

292
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,480
as the former King Neptune's head flies!

293
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,860
How regrettable...

294
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,330
Die!

295
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,290
Please, protect my father!

296
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,890
Luffy-sama!

297
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,780
T-That's...

298
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,870
Straw Hat... Luffy!

299
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,830
He really... did show up!

300
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,790
Hey, did you see that?

301
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,000
He saved King Neptune!

302
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,590
Yeah... And I'm sure
I just heard Princess Shirahoshi asking him for help...

303
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,770
Luffy-sama!

304
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,960
He came out of the shark?!

305
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,880
He's been hiding in its belly the whole time?!

306
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,310
Why?!

307
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,270
You came out early?

308
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,400
Well, I guess you had no choice.

309
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,820
Hurry, all of you!

310
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,980
What?  Who is he talking to -hi?!

311
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,870
Don't worry.  We were already hurrying.

312
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,270
It would take some sort of impossible miracle...

313
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,640
for Luffy to wait quietly according to plan.

314
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,240
Mirage canceled!

315
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,380
A woman appeared out of nowhere -hi!

316
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,970
Is this it, Jinbe-chan?

317
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,690
The form from the Celestial Dragons?

318
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,300
Excellent, you got it!

319
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,020
No way!  Huh?!

320
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,240
The form's gone!  When did she...

321
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,140
You fool!  What were you doing?!

322
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,890
And Robin's got the keys to their chains.

323
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,870
No way...

324
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,050
The keys are gone!

325
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,780
What were you doing?!

326
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,410
The chains!

327
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,240
What is this?

328
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,370
Robin-sama...

329
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,490
What is this?

330
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,710
Father!  Are you alright?!

331
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,130
Hey, look up at the sky!  What is that?

332
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,490
That's...

333
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,300
A whale... and a lion?

334
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
No, that's not it!

335
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,760
That's...

336
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,730
{\an8}Lion's Roar Cannon

337
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,360
It's a pirate ship!

338
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,230
Fire!

339
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,290
Now!  Go, whale!

340
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,750
Hoe?!

341
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,920
Princes!  Hurry and get out of here, and take the King with you!

342
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,700
Not gonna happen!  Stop -zugan!

343
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,220
They took the Royals!

344
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,010
Damn it!  Return the Royal Family -gyaban!

345
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,640
What... happened?

346
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,150
It looks like Jinbe made a plan with Straw Hat and his crew.

347
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,650
Look!  There are so many people!

348
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,050
Hey, now!  Are all of these guys enemies?

349
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,220
Probably.  From looking at them,
I'd say there are about seventy or eighty thousand...

350
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,520
No, closer to a hundred thousand.

351
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,290
This is a little harsh.

352
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,780
In that case,
feel free to go nap in your room.

353
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,260
I'll take them all out!

354
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,330
The hell was that?!

355
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,440
I can see that you're itching for a fight.

356
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,910
Let's put on a flashy show, men!

357
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,910
Look!  The Straw Hats are
getting off the ship, one after another!

358
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,500
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy!

359
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,050
Do you really plan to destroy the island?!

360
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,750
Why did you occupy Ryuuguu Palace?!

361
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,300
Are you planning to kill the Royal Family too?!

362
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,640
Did you kidnap those mermaids?!

363
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
Hey, answer us!

364
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,430
Are you Fishman Island's enemies?  Or are you allies?

365
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,280
Answer us, Straw Hat!

366
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,680
Friend or foe...

367
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
You guys can...

368
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,550
decide that for yourselves!
