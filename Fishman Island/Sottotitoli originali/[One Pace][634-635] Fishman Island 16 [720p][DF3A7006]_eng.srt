1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,160
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,660
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,430
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,070
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,220
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,590
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,620
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,200
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,290
Move!

10
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,790
I will not!

11
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,710
Luffy-chin... Boss Jinbe...

12
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,260
Come on, we just gonna stand around?

13
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,850
Um, excuse me, my father's life is...

14
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,000
I said move, so move already!

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,100
I'm going to kick their asses,
even if I have to go through you!

16
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,710
How many times are you going to make me say it?
I told you to wait!

17
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,190
Listen to what I have to say!

18
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,480
What kind of relationship do we have?

19
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
We're friends.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,190
That's right.

21
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,510
For years now, it's been a struggle for fishmen and humans to create a simple relationship like ours.

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,900
The reason why I told you not to fight with Hody...

23
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,440
is because I didn't want you to start a reckless fight.
Don't act rashly!

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,640
If you just beat up Hody, then the people of this island will see you as nothing but another heartless human.

25
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,390
Instead of that,

26
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,520
please become the hero who saved Fishman Island!

27
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,700
Hero?

28
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,580
Don't wanna!

29
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,540
Whaaat?!

30
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,400
We're pirates!

31
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,910
I love heroes, but I don't wanna be one!

32
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,670
Do you even know what it means to be a hero?

33
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,640
Hmm?

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,870
Well, think about the meat, right?

35
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,450
Pirates eat meat at huge feasts,

36
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,520
but heroes have to take the meat and share it with people.

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I wanna eat the meat!

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,330
What kind of logic is that?

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,820
Fine.  I'll give you meat, so just do what I tell you!

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,620
Okay.

41
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,700
It's that easy?!

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,550
To put it simply, I'll have you help me.

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,680
As long as you can do that, it'll be fine.

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Help you?

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,550
Yes, first Megalo and I will
intentionally get captured and infiltrate their position.

46
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,360
And then, when I have their attention,

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,460
one of you will stealthily
sneak out of Megalo's stomach.

48
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,340
From inside his stomach?

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,590
And then you'll get the Celestial Dragons' form.

50
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,380
What form?

51
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,800
Oh right, Luffy was asleep,
so he barely heard a word of Jinbe's story.

52
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:55,190
Well, it's a very important piece of paper that
Queen Otohime risked her life to get ten years ago.

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,530
The other thing we need is
the key to the King's chains.

54
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,030
Stealing those things...
Do we have someone who can do that?

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,830
Leave the theft to me.
I could do it... with Robin's help.

56
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,910
Quite.

57
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,880
So after you've freed the King, I'll ask Luffy-kun to help me.

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,260
And then you'll make a grand entrance out of Megalo's stomach.

59
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,720
Everyone will understand that
Luffy-kun and I are working together.

60
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,980
The Princess can wait in a safe location
outside the plaza, ready to take the letter.

61
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,150
Then she can escape with the King and the others,
once they have been freed.

62
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,440
While that is happening, the rest of you
will hurry to Ryuuguu Palace and release our allies.

63
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,460
Once that's done, hurry back to the plaza.

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,120
As for how you free our allies in the palace...

65
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,580
Come up with something yourself.

66
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,540
That isn't a plan!

67
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,060
Super-leave it to me!

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,670
I've got the Sunny,
so I'll be sure to come up with that something.

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,740
If we follow this plan,
how do you think the citizens will react?

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,510
You two?

71
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,980
Jinbe-san is respected by both the citizens of the island and the villagers from the Fishman District.

72
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,950
That's right, if everyone sees that Boss trusts Luffy-chin with his life while they save the King,

73
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,200
then I'm sure that everyone will cheer for Luffy-chin!

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,620
Straw Hat.

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,080
Luffy-sama.

76
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,910
I'm only doing it because
you're the one who's asking, Jinbe!

77
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,880
Being cheered on by everyone will just distract me!

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,010
That doesn't happen very often, after all.

79
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,390
With mermaid ladies cheering for me, I could defeat the devil himself!

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,770
Thanks.

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,680
Well then, it appears to be settled.

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,450
All that's left is to do it!

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,820
Are you still worried about something?

84
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,280
What should we name this operation?

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,310
We don't need a bloody name!

86
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,120
Alright, let's hurry!

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,090
Straw Hat Luffy is a human pirate that's on our side, right?

88
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,580
Princess Shirahoshi asked him for help!

89
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,390
He's come with Boss Jinbe to save this country!

90
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,860
Straw Hat!

91
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,890
It sounds like you've become quite popular...

92
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,830
but you shouldn't get cocky
just because you snatched the King away from us!

93
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,930
You're still just human pirates!

94
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,030
{\an5}100,000 vs. 10!
The Straw Hats' Explosive Moves

95
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,310
Mermaid Princess-san, you are so lovely.

96
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,340
Excuse me, but you wouldn't let me see your panties, would-

97
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,760
Cut that out!  She's the Mermaid Princess.

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,530
Okay, can I settle for Nami-san's?

99
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,760
Settle?!

100
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, it looks like everyone's finally here.

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,020
They totally ignored you!

102
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,820
I said it quietly intentionally so they couldn't hear me!

103
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,390
Nami-swan!  I was the one who saved those idiots!

104
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,400
Have you fallen for me?

105
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah, whatever.

106
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,770
What an idiot, we made it to the exit by ourselves.

107
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,450
Yep.

108
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,580
That's because I saved you!

109
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,140
Pappagg, you saved them?

110
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,720
Here you go.

111
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,480
The Celestial Dragons' form.

112
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,250
Thank you very much, every one of you.

113
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,820
This is Fishman Island's greatest hope,
it's my mother's legacy.

114
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,200
But then again, Weak-hoshi is bit of a liability.

115
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,180
It certainly wasn't part of my plan
for her to be captured,

116
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,700
but I'm not sure how to get her out of here.

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,170
Luffy-sama, are you talking about me?

118
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,780
Yeah.

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,590
Just that, up until now you've been calling me, "Wimp."

120
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,510
Yeah, I didn't know all the details.
You're not as much of a wimp as I thought you were.

121
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,130
So from now on, you're...

122
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,120
Weak-hoshi!

123
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,840
Anybody can react with anger and hatred
when they are faced with trouble.

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,130
Just like that man who was insulting you.

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:24,160
A wimp would never have the strength
to hold all of that hatred inside of themselves.

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,200
That's exactly right.

127
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,040
It must have been incredibly trying
for Princess Shirahoshi over all those years.

128
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,670
My sincerest apologies.  This is all happening
because I kept the truth to myself.

129
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,400
That's fine.  You should be proud.

130
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,140
We mustn't let the hatred get the better of us.
Those great people wouldn't want us to.

131
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,230
Don't tell the people on our island anything! { from 543 }

132
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,690
Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me. { from 546 }

133
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,490
You planted a small seed in your heart.

134
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,980
We can hope that the seed
will grow and cover the island.

135
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,920
If a day comes when
everyone thinks the same way as you do...

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,510
then there would be no more strife between fishmen and humans,

137
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,460
and the cycle of revenge would disappear.

138
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,530
I don't want to disrespect those long years that you endured...

139
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:28,440
Alone day after day,
protecting that seed with your life.

140
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,350
But now, we'd like your permission to help protect that seed.

141
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,170
Y-Y-Yes!

142
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,910
Thank you so very much!

143
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,600
You're not a wimp, but you sure are a crybaby!

144
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,100
Straw Hat!  Go get 'em!

145
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,000
Vander Decken wasn't of any use at all.

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,780
He was supposed to eliminate Shirahoshi.

147
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,500
Captain Hody!

148
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,130
The legendary Mermaid Princess with her troubling power...

149
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,590
All he had to do was eliminate Shirahoshi quickly.

150
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,550
Hell, and now I've been played for a fool.

151
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,370
Jinbe... I should have figured it out
when you let yourself be captured so easily.

152
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,600
You've really become a human-lover!

153
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,120
You're the type of person I hate the most!

154
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,180
Fisher Tiger and your sworn brother Arlong
were both raised in the Fishman District with you,

155
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,420
and both of them were killed by humans.

156
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,230
But instead of avenging your brother's death, you've gone and made friends with the one who killed him!

157
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,590
You've become even worse than Neptune,
you damned coward!

158
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,880
When I become the king of this island,
everything will change.

159
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,610
This year's World Council Meeting will be the perfect opportunity.

160
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:37,140
I'll go to Mariejoa and slaughter
all the human kings of the world.

161
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,440
Then the curtain will rise on
our feared undersea kingdom!

162
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,510
We'll drag all the humans of the world
down to the sea floor, and make them our slaves!

163
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,770
Eventually there will be no one left
to oppose fishmankind!

164
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,670
It will be the same in the world of piracy.

165
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,100
All of the pirates will grovel
in front of the New Fishman Pirates!

166
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,930
Look at this!

167
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,280
These are the faces of the pirates who know my strength.

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,090
This is your future.

169
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,820
Straw Hat, in the end I will be the one
worthy of being called Pirate King.

170
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,260
Pirate King?

171
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,990
What can a mere ten pirates do?
A mere breath from me is enough to send you flying.

172
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,310
I've got one hundred thousand!

173
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,390
Kill them, New Fishman Pirates!

174
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,920
There's one hundred thousand of them!

175
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,320
How can we fight that many?!

176
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,650
It's impossible!

177
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,320
Nothing good has ever come
from being friends with you guys.

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,710
It looks like we may be crushed
before we even get a chance to fight.

179
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,030


180
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,030


181
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,530
Crushed!?  Too scary!

182
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,820
So, one hundred thousand enemies...

183
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,680
It certainly is an astonishing amount.
It's enough to make your eyes pop out.

184
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,210
But then, I don't have any eyes to pop out.

185
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,550
What's one hundred thousand enemies?!  Let's get it started!

186
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,880
Easy for you to say!
You're using us as human shields!

187
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,920
So my time has finally come.

188
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,140
Super Armored Me!

189
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,020
Now, come at me from wherever you want!

190
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,960
We have ten people...
so each of us have to take out ten thousand.

191
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,470
Superior numbers doesn't always mean strength.

192
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,910
It's not like they're Navy elites or anything.  You're cowering for nothing.

193
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,490
Who's cowering, you shitty moss-head?!

194
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,460
You are, you little nosebleed chef!

195
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,040
Hey, Luffy...

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
L-Luffy-kun.

197
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,790
Luffy-sama.

198
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,670
I'll take his 400 million head!

199
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,070
No, I will!

200
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,850
You think I'll let you?

201
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,680
Kill them.

202
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,050
What happened?!

203
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,120
He took out a hell of a lot of pirates without even lifting a finger!

204
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,290
Hey!  Pull yourselves together!

205
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,790
Dammit!  He dropped half of us in an instant!

206
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,790
Fifty thousand.... just like that?!  What the hell did he do?!

207
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,090
What was that?

208
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,210
What?  What happened?

209
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,920
You can really do it, can't you, Straw Hat Boy?

210
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,210
The Straw Hat pirate did that?

211
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,890
You're amazing, Straw Hat!

212
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,690
Was that haki?

213
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,480
He has come so far in just two years?

214
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,830
The Color of the Conqueror.  He had it all this time?

215
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,730
If he wasn't at least this strong,
then I'd have to become the new captain.

216
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,200
You're amazing, Luffy-sama.

217
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,450
You're Hody, right?  I have to kick your ass.

218
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,330
If you wanna go around and become the king of
some countries, then that's none of my business...

219
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,840
But there's only room for one Pirate King!

220
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,020
He may have just taken out fifty thousand men...

221
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,970
but...

222
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,710
we still have fifty thousand left!

223
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,230
The Straw Hat Pirates won't stop until they've shattered our ambitions!

224
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,160
They are our sworn enemies!

225
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,940
And Jinbe...

226
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,770
is the embodiment of
the worst possible future for fishmankind.

227
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,440
One where Otohime's dreams have become reality
and we coexist with human filth!

228
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,290
Yeah!  Who cares about Straw Hat?!

229
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,250
He's just a human, after all!

230
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,370
As for Jinbe... we must kill the traitor to fishmankind!

231
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,740
Luffy, fifty thousand is going too far.

232
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,160
You took out too many.

233
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,930
Oh?  Sorry.

234
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,190
What're you so fired up over?

235
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm gonna take thirty thousand.  You got that, Moss-Head?

236
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,650
Shut it, Mister Nosebleed.

237
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,570
Our race is superior!

238
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,870
Time to show them that!

239
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,470
Let's go!

240
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,470
I don't care how many thousands of you there are!  Bring it on!

241
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,330
Here he comes!

242
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,110
What happened to his hand?!

243
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,910
Right.  Shall we get started too?

244
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,870
I will not let you destroy my Mermaid Paradise!

245
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,780
Will they surrender, or will they be destroyed?

246
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,220
Fishman Island... There are vital pieces of the world's history in this country!

247
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,810
It is not something you should casually destroy!

248
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,680
It's so hot.

249
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Perfect weather for a concert!

250
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,660
An army of fifty thousand...
This is an ideal stage to reveal my surprises!

251
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,580
Surprises?

252
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,790
What are you talking about, Franky?

253
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,120
The Sunny's got some new weapons!  Two of them!

254
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,670
Anyone want to try them?

255
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,630
New weapons?!

256
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,650
If you think you can protect that giant mermaid...

257
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,150
when she's sitting out in the middle of the plaza...

258
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,940
then go ahead and try!

259
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,710
Whoa... Guess I didn't have to worry.

260
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,710
Captain Hody's insanely powerful Uchimizu...

261
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,020
He deflected it with an Uchimizu of his own!

262
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,350
That man is a monster too!

263
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,760
I don't know what you did to gain such power...

264
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,180
but your Fishman Karate lacks discipline!

265
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,140
He's the first fishman to join
the Seven Warlords of the Sea, after all.

266
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,120
I heard that his bounty shot up to more than 400 million after he quit being a Warlord!

267
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,110
What chance do we have against someone like that?!

268
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,320
Don't just stand there jabbering, bring it on!

269
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,910
If you're going to take the Princess's life
then you'll have to beat all of us first!

270
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,830
Attack, Steel Shell Squadron!

271
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,750
Yeah!

272
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,100
{\an8}Black Rope - Grand Dragon Twist/Tornado {What an incredibly bloated TL note...}

273
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,370
He sliced through the steel shells like they were fruit!

274
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,970
W-What was that huge attack?
The Grim Reaper's scythe or something?

275
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,710
It's not over!

276
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,540
It won't stop!

277
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,220
It's a tornado that slices anything it touches!

278
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,240
Run!  It'll cut you to pieces!

279
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,210
How far is it gonna chase us?!

280
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,380
All the way to the ends of hell.

281
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,220
Use your heads, idiots!

282
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Increase your bubble's altitude!

283
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,420
We'll attack from the sky!

284
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,890
Kill Princess Shirahoshi!

285
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,250
You're all gonna get skewered!

286
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,500
Get them, Harisenbon!

287
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,630
Oh, it's Commander Harisenbon and his men.

288
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,040
The Sea Urchin Spine Squadron! {Again, the alliteration was honestly not intended.}

289
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,680
Skewer that man with the fancy footwork!

290
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,370
{\an8}A Thousand Needles

291
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,770
You've got nowhere to run now!

292
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,980
Sanji-san, watch out!

293
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,980
Why are you so calm?

294
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,270
Hey!

295
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,960
Thinking back on it, I almost feel nostalgic...

296
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,000
Sanji-kyun!

297
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,670
I ran.

298
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,440
Wait, Sanji-chan!

299
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,890
Like hell I will, you ass!

300
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,140
But I brought my favorite dress for you!

301
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,530
Come here!

302
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,350
You don't have to be shy!

303
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm telling you, I'll never wear that thing!

304
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,220
And who's shy?!

305
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,630
On rainy days...

306
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,130
On snowy days...

307
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,410
Even on days of lightning...

308
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,500
I ran, and ran.

309
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,120
Take out the man with the fancy footwork!

310
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,980
You silly thing...

311
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,470
Did you think we'd never catch up to you?

312
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,960
Sanji-kyun!

313
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,690
Can I really let these guys get the better of me?

314
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,760
Sanji-kyun!

315
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,120
Until one day, when I was finally cornered...

316
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,810
I ran...

317
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,380
Huh?  He's not here.

318
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,030
And ran...

319
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,280
Sanji-kyun!

320
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,960
I...

321
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,170
was running...

322
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,930
across the sky!

323
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,870
Up there!

324
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,050
Amazing!  Sanji is flying!

325
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,520
Just like those other guys!

326
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,650
{\an8}Moon Step

327
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,620
That's the CP9's Geppou technique.

328
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,710
Hey, you guys!

329
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,050
What?!  He's flying!

330
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,960
If you have any business with Shirahoshi-chan, you're gonna have to go through me!

331
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,770
Even crying children are hushed when they see me...

332
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,770
I am your knight!

333
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,460
Sanji-chin-sama!

334
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,030
That arrogant bastard!

335
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,140
Now to cook the small-fry.

336
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,640
Let's finish this -dosun!

337
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,970
Bombarding Squad!

338
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,100
Aim for Shirahoshi!

339
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm afraid I cannot allow that.

340
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,680
How could you try to hurt the Mermaid Princess,
who is beloved by the whole world?

341
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,190
What's going on?  It got dark all of a sudden.

342
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,000
Welcome to festival night!

343
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,810
What?

344
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,930
Are we...

345
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,260
dreaming or something?

346
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,710
Now, launch the fireworks!

347
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,110
This is great!

348
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,280
It's so beautiful!

349
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,200
Hey!  I told you to aim for the Princess -bokan!

350
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,480
But...

351
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,920
Dosun-san, we're at such a fun festival.

352
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,290
Alright!  You have already been cut.

353
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,330
Feet?!

354
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,030
Sorry for this.

355
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,690
It's really noisy outside.

356
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,130
What's going on?

357
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,780
Hey, you two get out of here!  It's too cramped!

358
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,480
You don't even care about the new weapons,
do you?  You get out!

359
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,460
I got in because it's too scary outside!

360
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,740
I don't want to be left outside either!

361
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,810
Franky, can we use the weapons yet?

362
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,650
Don't be so impatient.

363
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,570
Now, it's time for the show!

364
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,630
I'm starting to get excited too!

365
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,500
Hey wait... I'm supposed to be steering this thing.

366
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,090
It got bigger!

367
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,110
What's going on?

368
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,630
Now, the Sunny Soldier Dock's new weapons...

369
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,840
So excited!

370
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,870
What's gonna happen?

371
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,040
...will be unveiled!

372
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Lethal Poison Squad, go!

373
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,820
Yeah!

374
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,320
Giant feet, giant hands, or whatever...

375
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,520
A single hit from our poisonous weapons
will take them down!

376
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,840
Now wait just a minute!

377
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,330
Soldier Dock System...

378
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,440
Channel Four!

379
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,950
The Black Rhino...

380
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,810
FR-U 4!

381
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,250
That's so awesome!  A rhinobike!

382
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,730
What is that thing?  It looks powerful!

383
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,820
What was that about poisonous weapons?

384
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,070
What is that?!

385
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:50,170
You think they'll work on this steel monster?  Just go ahead and try to stab it!

386
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,130
Well?  Super cool, isn't it?

387
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,270
Stop them!

388
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,890
Right... Fight steel with steel!

389
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,380
Leave it to me!

390
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,610
Take this!  I'm gonna flatten you!

391
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,300
Hey!

392
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,740
The New Number, Channel Five!

393
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,600
Brachio Tank 5 has arrived!

394
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,400
There it is!  A dinosaur!  I wanna try it! { def: There it is? }{ Btwb: That confuses me too. }

395
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,400
Amazing!

396
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,220
Did you see my bombardment skills?

397
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,130
Looks like it's got plenty of other features, too.

398
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,760
But... he's supposed to be a shipwright... isn't he?

399
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,860
Commander Chopper reporting in!

400
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,430
A group of enemies spotted at nine o'clock!

401
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,740
Fire! {I would just like to take a moment to point out how the sound this tank makes is the greatest thing ever.}{Ditto}

402
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,810
Fire!

403
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,910
Fire!

404
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,920
Commander, you're so cool!

405
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,250
Keep fighting, damn you!

406
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,120
Amazing... Those guys are truly amazing!

407
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,330
There's only ten of them, yet they're fighting
an army of a hundred thousand like it was nothing!

408
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,730
Straw Hat!

409
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,080
We're counting on you!

410
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,830
Boss Jinbe!

411
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,880
They're all getting carried away.

412
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,550
Show yourself, Kraken!

413
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,340
It's huuuge!

414
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,570
They're just ten people.  Flatten them!

415
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,170
That'll be the end of it!

416
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,400
Oh no!  He summoned the legendary beast,
the Kraken!

417
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,570
Get out of the way!

418
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,930
It doesn't matter how strong the Straw Hats are,
if that thing smashes them they're dead for sure!

419
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,720
Alright, it's the Kraken!  He's the captain's slave!

420
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,460
He's freakishly strong!

421
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,410
It's time you learn how terrifying deep sea creatures can be!

422
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,200
Hey, isn't that...

423
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,080
What are you doing?!

424
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,420
Don't hesitate.  I brought you here from the North Pole!

425
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,090
You're my slave!

426
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,930
Serve your master!

427
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,390
You can do it, can't you?!

428
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,830
P-P-Please wait!

429
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,380
Retreat!

430
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,190
Hey, Surume!

431
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,050
It's me!

432
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,540
I made you my pet earlier.  We're friends, right?

433
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,680
He did it!

434
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,990
Luffy-sama!

435
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,090
That tickles!  C-Cut it out, Surume!

436
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,980
What?!

437
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,060
Alright... Surume!  Let's get going!

438
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,540
The Kraken betrayed us!

439
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,040
Stop, Kraken!

440
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,970
You stupid octopus!

441
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,640
Go get 'em, Surume!

442
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,220
Help me... Captain...

443
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,000
Kraken, over there!

444
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,350
Damn it, what's going on?!

445
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,120
The Kraken is acting all friendly with Straw Hat!

446
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,870
Listen up, Surume.
You stay here and protect Weak-hoshi!

447
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,870
I can't believe you're friends with the Kraken.

448
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:38,470
The relationships you have always take me by surprise!

449
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,470
Really?

450
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,310
Uhm... I'm very pleased to meet you, Surume-sama.

451
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,740
There's still plenty of them left.

452
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,410
Right!  Let's do this!
