1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,920
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,700
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,460
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,810
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,810
You say you'll protect them all?

10
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't make me laugh!

11
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,030
You sure have a big mouth, Straw Hat.

12
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,770
Damn that Hody.  He's even willing to attack Decken.

13
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,300
Run away, Shirahoshi!

14
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,070
Draw the Noah away from the island as far as possible!

15
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,330
It's too late.

16
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,380
Too late?  What's he talking about?

17
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,960
Wait... Didn't he just take out Decken?!

18
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,380
If Decken dies or loses consciousness inside the Noah...

19
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,740
...then his ability will stop working right above Fishman Island.

20
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,200
The Noah... will fall...

21
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,090
right onto the island!

22
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,230
What're ya doin'?

23
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,670
Dat hurt!

24
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,140
You damn Manjuu-bastard.

25
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,140
{\an8}Manjuu: A rotund Japanese pastry

26
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,550
How dare you...

27
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,960
knock Nami-san over
with the shockwave from your fall!

28
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,980
Payback time!

29
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,360
This is payback...

30
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,030
for the shockwave that hit Nami-san! {...Say, does anyone else think this is an exceptionally petty grudge he's holding? "YOU FELL NEAR NAMI AND KNOCKED HER OVER, YOU ARE SO GOING TO DIE!!!!!!!"}

31
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,120
Oh, crap!

32
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,810
Beware of the shockwave, Nami-san! { def: they're saying shockwave way too much.  maybe just "Look out" or something similar here? }

33
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,520
Another shockwave?  Give me a break!

34
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,470
Don't let your guard down!  Watch out!

35
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,640
She made something fly out of her staff earlier!

36
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,490
What now?!

37
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,900
Is she a witch?!

38
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,780
How rude!  I'm not a witch!

39
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,780
Call me an enchantress instead! { def: originally "Magician-chan" }

40
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,870
Granted, it's not really magic.  Just calculated science.

41
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,670
C-Clouds?!

42
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,870
{\an8}Thundercloud Rod

43
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,430
Hot!

44
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,170
Help us!

45
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,020
Stay away!  I'll turn into a fried squid -hi!

46
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,060
Was it that woman's fault -hi?!

47
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,860
Hey, Ikaros.

48
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,120
The man in the black suit
became concerned when he thought she was hurt.

49
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,040
She is most likely the Straw Hat Pirates' weak point.

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,020
What?!

51
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,410
I'll go hold her still.

52
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,250
When I do, finish her off with your spears!

53
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,080
Roger that -muhi!

54
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,750
Just leave me alone now,
unless you want to be roasted!

55
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,660
What?!  My legs won't move!

56
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,730
I'm gonna make you into fried squid -hi!

57
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,120
W-W-Wait a second!

58
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,690
Why won't my feet move?!  Somebody!

59
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,030
Nami-san!  Oh, that's right!

60
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,700
Take this!  My Fried Squid Spear!

61
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,120
May I see your panti-

62
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
No way!

63
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
Is this a friend of yours?

64
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,090
He's gonna be dried up!

65
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,630
Become a fried squid!

66
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,950
Pardon?

67
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,640
What's happening -hi?

68
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,140
My spears should drain the water from your body,
and dry you up -hi!

69
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,890
Hey, Dried Squid Spears!  Why?!

70
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,230
What's wrong?!
Why?!  Why?!  Why?!  Why?!  Why?!  Why?!

71
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,300
Umm...

72
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,810
I dried out a long time ago.

73
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,950
There's no way that could possibly be true!

74
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,920
Hey!  Aren't there any worthy opponents around?

75
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,670
Are you alright?

76
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,160
Who are you -hi?!

77
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,710
It's me!

78
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,090
That doesn't help -hi!

79
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,210
What?!  You don't recognize this super robot?!

80
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,590
Hmm?  Now that I look at you,
I see that you're one of the commanders!

81
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,090
You must have backbone, right?!

82
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,350
I may be a squid, but I'm also a fishman!
I do have a backbone!

83
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,020
What?  You're a squid, yet you have a backbone?

84
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,630
Sympathy!

85
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,030
He didn't mean it literally.

86
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,260
Hey, skeleton.  Step to the side real quick.

87
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,590
What?  Why is that?

88
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,330
Your feet!  Your feet!

89
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,770
What about my feet?

90
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,380
You're standing on him!  Standing right on him!

91
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,530
Huh?!  Who's this guy?!

92
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,750
He's the reason why I couldn't move?!

93
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,920
Um... Who might you be?

94
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,670
How do you like it?!

95
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,720
What?

96
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,450
The power of my headbutt to the bottom of your foot!

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,020
What?

98
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,600
My attack will slowly begin to take effect.

99
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,940
What?!

100
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,840
He refuses to admit that he got stepped on!

101
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,530
My apologies for stepping on your face!

102
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,750
Don't say that!

103
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,540
My attack's name is...

104
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,620
Chou Ashiura Zutsuki!

105
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,570
Super Sole Headbutt!

106
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,870
He gave it a name!

107
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,930
Where'd you go, you damn coral-head?!

108
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,020
I'll chew you to pieces!

109
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,840
There's no way I can lose underground!  I move wherever I want!

110
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,370
Daruma-san!

111
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,450
Don't fill the ground with too many holes!

112
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,620
We're gonna get stuck!

113
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,240
Alright!

114
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,130
Chopper!  Are you done?

115
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,290
Come out over here!

116
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,330
Fool!  He's let his guard down -dogon!

117
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,620
I'll flatten him!

118
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,590
Be squashed and die -zugan!

119
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,850
Usopp, duck!

120
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,020
{\an8}Horn Cannon: Eleven

121
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,280
Nice going, Chopper!  Did you connect the tunnels?

122
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,990
Yeah, it's done!

123
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,630
Alright!  Here we go!

124
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,650
{\an8}Skull Bomb-Grass

125
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,340
How'd you like that taste of my strength?!

126
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,330
We fought against enemies who dug holes back in Alabasta! { def: my attempt at fade sux0r } {Swashy: Removed 'already' and the comma b/w 'holes' and 'back'.}

127
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,080
Our experience won this fight!

128
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,770
Yeah!

129
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,860
Damn you, coral-monster!

130
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,020
Was that you?!

131
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,070
I'll show you my terrifying power!

132
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,870
When it comes to power, I've got an ace up my sleeve!

133
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,290
I'll chew that nose to pieces!

134
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,420
Why don't you try?!  Back me up, Chopper!

135
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,410
H-Hey, I need backup!

136
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,810
Chopper?

137
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,480
Help me.

138
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,560
Are you alright?

139
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,070
I'll treat your wounds right away.

140
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,070
Darling!  Stay awake!

141
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,470
Daddy!

142
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,500
Hurry and treat their wounds!  Quickly!

143
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,370
Damn Hody.
He even attacked defenseless citizens!

144
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,770
Is the princess... alright?

145
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,260
I don't know.

146
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,610
But I'm sure...

147
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,140
she's still fighting for us!

148
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,770
Madame Shyarly.
What will happen to Fishman Island? { def: more importantly, what happened to your chin? }

149
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,640
Will it really be destroyed?!

150
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,530
I have to take it away.  Far away!

151
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,030
You sure are desperate.

152
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,060
Away from the island...

153
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,860
Noah!

154
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,720
Shirahoshi!

155
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,980
If the Noah falls, it's all over!

156
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,700
Oh no!  She can't hear us!

157
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,620
You mustn't swim straight up!

158
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,360
To the side!  Move to the side!

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,910
So they've caught on?!

160
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,430
Shirahoshi!

161
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,050
Brother!

162
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,630
Ryuuboshi!

163
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,410
Don't interfere with my plan!

164
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,010
Brother!  Hang in there!

165
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,640
If Decken's power doesn't stop working here, then what was the point of killing him?

166
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,580
So that's it!

167
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,250
If we don't move, then the ship will crash down onto Fishman Island and everyone there!

168
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,220
After Weak-hoshi worked so hard to draw it away from the island!

169
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,180
Bro-hoshi!  Let's go to Weak-hoshi!

170
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,410
Right!

171
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,060
Shirahoshi!

172
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,980
Weak-hoshi!

173
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,740
I won't let you go!

174
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,700
Fishman Island will be crushed, along with all of its people!

175
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,920
Straw Hat, all your companions are sure to die as well!

176
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,950
Are you alright?!

177
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,580
Shirahoshi!

178
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,200
Swim to the side!

179
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,510
Shirahoshi!

180
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,690
Shirahoshi!

181
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,070
Weak-hoshi!

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,820
Damn mermaid!

183
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,900
How insolent!

184
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,970
Shirahoshi heard us!

185
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,450
She's swimming to the side!

186
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,030
You shouldn't have done that!

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,070
I won't let you!

188
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,930
Wait!

189
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,710
Let me go!

190
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,260
I ain't letting go!

191
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,130
Damn it...

192
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,930
Noah!  Come this way!

193
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm losing my grip...

194
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,940
Noah!  Follow me!

195
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,770
Let's go!

196
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,930
Right!

197
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,900
Damn Decken!  Just die already!

198
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,700
Damn it.

199
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,540
That bastard, Hody.  I won't let him get away with this!

200
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,860
Noah!  I'm right here!

201
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,590
The ship... It's starting to move to the side!

202
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,230
Great!  Keep going, Weak-hoshi!

203
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,640
Shirahoshi!

204
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Go!

205
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
My left hand's target...

206
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,170
Hody, it's you!

207
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,410
Remember that!

208
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,110
Until you die...

209
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,080
I will always be hunting you, body and soul!

210
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,620
Noah!

211
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,710
Shirahoshi!  Just a little further!

212
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,710
If it moves too far, all of this was pointless!

213
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,300
All the way to the ends of hell!

214
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,060
The Noah... is falling!

215
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,690
Just in time!

216
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,810
Fishman Island...

217
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,210
is still in danger!

218
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,660
It can't be!

219
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,830
Victory is mine!

220
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,420
So he finally bought it.

221
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,630
Now Vander Decken's power will stop working,
and the Noah will crash down onto Fishman Island!

222
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,470
Die!  Straw Hat Pirates!

223
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,620
You fools have gotten in the way of my retribution.

224
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,480
Fishman Island's going to...

225
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,700
...be destroyed.

226
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,000
One way or another, we have to stop the ship.

227
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,750
Straw Hat!

228
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,130
You wanna stop the Noah, don't you?

229
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,340
That bastard.

230
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,880
If the Noah crashes into Fishman Island,
then it's all over.

231
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,970
Our kingdom and the centuries-old mission
to protect the Noah.

232
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,040
Listen, my sons.

233
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,450
That Ark, the Noah, isn't just a historical ruin.

234
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,950
A long time ago, hundreds of years past,
we exchanged promises with a very important person.

235
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,900
That ship has been waiting patiently
on the ocean floor to carry out that promise.

236
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,500
The ship has not yet completed its mission.

237
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,430
And now, even the techniques used to build the ship
have been lost in time.

238
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,850
Until the promised day comes,
we mustn't allow the Noah to get a single scratch!

239
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,120
We understand, Father.

240
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,100
We will find out what's causing it to move
and deal with it appropriately.

241
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,810
We have to save our kingdom and the Noah,
no matter the cost!

242
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,790
Was it just a bluff when you said that
you would protect everyone, Straw Hat?!

243
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,130
I'm gonna stop it!

244
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,970
I'll smash that boat into smithereens before it hits the island!

245
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,950
Don't even say that!

246
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,880
Even if you could do it, I already told you that the Noah holds both our past and future.

247
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,700
Then is there another way we can save the island?

248
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,130
We don't have time to think.

249
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,950
What else can we do?

250
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,090
Decken may still be alive.

251
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,040
If we get him to wake up, we might be able to
make him change the ship's course!

252
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,440
You say that, but what if he's dead?

253
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,920
If we don't hurry up and destroy the ship-

254
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,550
I told you to stop saying that!

255
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,560
You two gonna start fighting?

256
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,360
Look at what's happening while you two squabble.

257
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
Noah's gonna crash into Fishman Island.

258
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,790
Please wait, Noah!

259
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,280
There are many people on the island who are precious to me!

260
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,090
Decken-sama!

261
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,070
If you're alive, then please, aim the boat at me!

262
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,160
Please spare the lives of everyone on Fishman island!

263
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,580
Shirahoshi!

264
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,340
{\an8}Sea drum

265
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,120
Manboshi dearest!

266
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,390
Manboshi!

267
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,490
And now it's your turn.

268
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,470
Hody!

269
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,150
Straw Hat!

270
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,830
Luffy-sama?!

271
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,860
Dammit.

272
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,840
My Color of Arms is good against blunt strikes,

273
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,780
but it's useless against this kind of attack.

274
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,270
My Haki still needs training.

275
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,810
We don't have the time to fight underwater.

276
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,750
If I'm gonna kick his ass, we have to move.

277
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,080
In other words, you want to fight on this falling ship?

278
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,130
But what you really want must be...

279
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,490
the air on board!

280
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,560
If I get on board,
I can take out that bastard Hody in a single hit!

281
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,170
I was worried he might do this!

282
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,870
Bubbles will break
if you tear a big enough hole in them!

283
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,430
Dammit, there isn't any air on the deck anymore!

284
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,670
By now you must know that humans, who are helpless in situations like this, truly are inferior to fishmen!

285
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,090
You're in no position to think about stopping the Noah.

286
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,510
You can't even beat me!

287
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,670
Die, Straw Hat!

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,620
What happened?

289
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,920
Luffy-sama.

290
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm incredibly sorry, but...

291
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Weak-hoshi?

292
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,040
Fukaboshi told me to do this.

293
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,940
Bro-hoshi.

294
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,250
Hody!

295
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,360
Just what are you trying to do?!

296
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,460
Don't you realize how many lives there are on that island?!

297
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,220
Bro-hoshi.

298
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,040
Fukaboshi dearest.

299
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,960
Even though you only have fake strength,

300
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,970
The fact that I couldn't stand up to you
means that I'm still inexperienced.  I'll admit that.

301
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,140
But there is still hope!

302
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,980
But Hody, why?!

303
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,190
Why are you trying to kill so many of your innocent brethren?

304
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,100
Just what is your goal?!

305
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,690
What drove you to do something so terrible, Hody?!{lit. cruel}

306
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,200
Die!

307
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,980
Fukaboshi dearest!

308
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,050
Fake strength like that can't beat me!

309
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,480
So you managed to survive?

310
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,170
Hody, what are you trying to do?!

311
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,860
You say you want retribution against the humans,
but you're attacking fishmen.

312
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,570
Don't you know how many of your fishmen brethren you're going to kill on Fishman Island?!

313
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,010
You're even going to kill
your childhood friends from Fishman District.

314
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,970
Do you know what you're doing?!

315
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:51,020
Do you have so much hatred for humans that you've become blind with rage?

316
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,740
What could have happened to you?

317
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,250
Were you abused by humans?

318
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,690
Did the humans kill
a loved one or a dear friend of yours?

319
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,940
What could have possibly happened to make you do this?

320
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,690
Answer me, Hody!

321
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,380
Just what did the humans do to you?!

322
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,940
Fukaboshi dearest!

323
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,700
Weak-hoshi...

324
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,560
Straw Hat Luffy-san.

325
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,830
This is the Air Tank.

326
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm the one you met earlier.

327
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,710
We've been briefed on this terrible situation.

328
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,210
Our sensors have detected the falling Noah.

329
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,080
Preparations are proceeding according to plan.

330
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,840
So this is what Bro-hoshi was talking about earlier.

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,340
Is there something you want on the deck?
Then I'll get there first. {First part from ep 559, 21:04.86, second half was not in previous ep}

332
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,640
Hody!{idnetical line}

333
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,770
Follow him!{Abbreviated line from 559}

334
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,080
No.  Wait, Straw Hat.{identical line}

335
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,380
Why do we have to wait?!{Different line from 559, but means almost the same thing}

336
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,220
You should have learned by now.{Identical line}

337
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,140
Fighting in the water is
devastatingly favorable for a fishman like Hody.{Identical line}

338
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,260
If we keep going...{identical line}

339
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,160
So what'll we do?!{identical line}

340
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,430
I have a plan.{identical line, and last from previous episode}

341
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,160
Hey! Where're you going, Bro-hoshi!{New dialogue starts with this line}

342
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,120
Prince Fukaboshi.

343
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,910
What has happened, Prince?

344
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,870
We may need a large amount of air soon.
Prepare it at once.

345
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,680
Aye!

346
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,120
It'll be fine.  Isn't there air on the deck?

347
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,100
I'll just defeat him there!

348
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:09,330
Leaving aside the problem of Decken,
do you think Hody will just fight you on your terms?

349
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,320
Take this Baby Snail Phone with you,
in case of emergency.

350
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,230
Be careful in your planning.  We're off!

351
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,420
Luffy-sama, whatever shall you do about the Noah?

352
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,510
Hey!  You there?

353
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,000
How're you gonna give us that air?

354
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,650
We'll use all of the air in the Air Tank.

355
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,110
Air Tank?  What's that?

356
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,980
It's an air transporting device,
used to deliver air to Fishman Island.

357
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,720
If we use the air in the Air Tank to create a bubble,
it should be possible to completely enclose the Noah.

358
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:49,100
But the bubble disables buoyancy,
so the air won't cause the Noah to float.

359
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,490
In other words, it won't stop the Noah's descent.

360
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,270
Also, to get a bubble big enough to enclose the Noah
we'll have to use all the air we have.

361
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,060
So we only get one shot.

362
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,750
We have one split second when the Noah is directly beside us and if we miss...

363
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,080
there'll be no second chance.

364
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,640
I didn't understand all that...

365
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,060
but basically, it's all or nothing?

366
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Yes sir.  I wish we could do more,
but all we can do is entrust everything to you.

367
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,480
We're incredibly sorry for putting you in this position-

368
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,310
Don't tell me how hard it is!
Just hurry up and give the air to me!

369
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,180
As long as I have air, I'll manage!

370
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,890
Roger that.

371
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,350
We'll do everything in our power to help you.

372
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,260
Luffy-san, we leave Fishman Island to you!

373
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,090
Straw Hat.  Shirahoshi.

374
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,770
What do you think you'll accomplish by staying with the Noah's descent?

375
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,720
This is just the sort of idiocy I expect from a human and the Mermaid Princess!

376
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,320
Straw Hat!

377
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,330
You bastard!

378
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,120
He doesn't give up!

379
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,800
Hey, human.  Give up, human.

380
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,010
Just looking at you makes my skin crawl.

381
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,220
Even if I shorten my life...

382
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,680
No matter how many bystanders are hurt...

383
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,530
I will have my revenge on you humans.

384
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,910
That Hody.

385
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,080
You absolutely can't miss.  We only get one chance.

386
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,380
If you miss, Fishman Island's...

387
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,290
Hey, Straw Hat.  Can you hear me?

388
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,150
It's Fukaboshi's voice!

389
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,320
Bro-hoshi, are you okay?

390
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,840
By some miracle.

391
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,230
But more importantly, listen closely.

392
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,560
Hody Jones...

393
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,420
I understand him now.

394
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,590
