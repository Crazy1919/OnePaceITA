1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,600


2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,390
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,940
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,300
It can be yours if you want!

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,450
Search for it!

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,820
I left everything in that one place.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,850
People now set sail in search of romance.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

10
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,650
There's something flying over there.

11
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,520
It's so far off, I can't see it very well.

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,390
Luffy-sama?  What is it?

13
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,180
Mom, what's that? {jeeves66: The mother makes a "What?" grunt after this line. Include?}

14
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,170
Hey, look at that!

15
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,540
What is that?

16
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,850
Ryuuguu Palace!  Ryuuguu Palace!

17
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,090
Please respond!  Ryuuguu Palace!

18
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,170
This is the border police!

19
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,010
Hello?  Hello?!

20
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,510
How strange.

21
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,590
Why can't we get in touch with them?

22
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,090
Is the Snail Phone sick or something?

23
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,300
Why are so many of those guys coming to Fishman Island now?

24
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,300
Who knows?

25
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,100
I doubt those dangerous guys from the Fishman District just said "Let's go shopping together!" either.

26
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,820
{\an5}The Beginning of the Vengeful Plan!
Zoro vs. Hody!

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,290
Listen up, men!

28
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,330
Today is the day.

29
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,840
This day will go down in history as the first day Fishman Island was united under one flag!

30
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,480
We'll never make progress as long as
fishmen and merfolk don't see eye to eye.

31
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,690
Humans, who can't even breathe underwater,
should be ruled by us...

32
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,100
like the inferior species they are!

33
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,590
Yeah!

34
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,320
Now is the time to correct the mistakes of history!

35
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,470
Yeah!

36
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,710
Today will be the anniversary of our engagement,
Shirahoshi!

37
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,370
There is no need to rush things!

38
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,180
The wedding can wait... until tomorrow.

39
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,050
The branch of the Sun Pirates that have been such a nuisance to us,

40
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,820
Jinbe's group, isn't here anymore -dosun!

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,320
Sea God Neptune, and the three brothers Fukaboshi, Ryuuboshi and Manboshi...

42
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,140
Muhi, if we can just take down those four, eliminating the Neptune Army will be no trouble at all -hi!

43
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,210
I'll tear them all apart!

44
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,330
Just give the word, and I'll cut 'em down.

45
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,510
Let us begin.

46
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,720
All of you, go and take control
of the locations you've been assigned to!

47
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,390
Today, the Ryuuguu Kingdom will fall,

48
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,850
and we will become
the rightful rulers of the ocean floor!

49
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,190
Yeah!

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,360
S-Send a report...

51
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,150
She... got... away.

52
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,980
I got some information after all.

53
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,420
There is a Poneglyph here.

54
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,360
This kingdom holds a vital clue
to the mystery of the void century!

55
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,280
Don't make it sound like I cut them down
just for the fun of it!

56
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,310
Well, you did seem to enjoy yourself during the fight.

57
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,650
You're like a natural born killer!

58
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,600
So if a bunch of pirates
came running at you with their swords raised...

59
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,860
you'd just offer them a cup of tea instead?!

60
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,330
That's right, we should have offered them
a cup of tea and sorted out our differences.

61
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,250
That would not have worked on these guys!

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,630
In any case, now that you've taken them all out,
we have no way to find out what they were after!

63
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,880
And why should I care?  That's your problem.

64
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,720
It feels like things are going from bad to worse.

65
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,450
Why is our crew filled with people like him?

66
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, look at the captain...

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,290
Yeah.  There's no use thinking about it.

68
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,740
I wonder if Luffy-san met the Mermaid Princess?

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,960
I would like to meet her as well.

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,910
Don't say that, just free me from these chains!

71
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,200
Give Shirahoshi back -jamon!

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,830
Again, why would we kidnap
the Mermaid Princess in the first place?

73
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,830
The culprit is Straw Hat Luffy -jamon!  Shirahoshi!

74
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,850
However, while I certainly saw
Luffy-san and the shark come out of that room,

75
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,170
I saw no sign of anyone
resembling a Mermaid Princess.

76
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,010
But she would never leave the castle on her own -jamon!

77
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,830
Shirahoshi is as large as I am -jamon.

78
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,560
There is no way she could leave without being seen!

79
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,420
What?!  The Mermaid Princess is huge?!

80
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,700
Ah'm the princess -jamon!

81
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,690
That is absurd.

82
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,140
Oh, I know -jamon!  He must have stuffed
Shirahoshi inside Megalo's mouth and dragged her off!

83
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,640
Don't joke around in this dire situation, Your Majesty.

84
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,070
Even if he came up with that idea,
how could he convince her to do it?

85
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,830
Anyway, our captain would never kidnap anyone!

86
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,440
If you're gonna suspect someone, then pick someone else!

87
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,730
No, I cannot think of anyone else.

88
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,270
If you do not return Shirahoshi to me unharmed, I will not return your ship or crew to you either.

89
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,980
Keep that in mind -jamon!

90
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,490
No way!  Why would you go that far?!

91
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,540
I-I did it!

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,670
It looks like the human pirates have succeeded.

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
Sunny!  You're alright!

94
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,800
You really are a super miraculous ship!

95
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,880
This place is called the ship graveyard.

96
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,810
Shipwrecks are carried here by the ocean currents.

97
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,330
Isn't it ironic?

98
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,180
That a place like this would
receive the blessing of the Sunlight Tree Eve,

99
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,130
and the most beautiful corals would grow here,
attracting the fishes and whales.

100
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,100
It's amazing.

101
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,150
There are lots of whales here that are many times bigger than the Sunny!

102
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,280
Whales can tell where the most fertile seas are,
and they gather there.

103
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,290
What a wonderful sea!

104
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:41,400
I make a living by investigating this mysterious Sea Forest.

105
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,090
I can hardly believe that this is the deep sea.

106
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,300
The same can be said for Fishman Island too.

107
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm impressed that you managed
to get wood from the Treasure Tree Adam.

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,250
This is a fine ship,
worthy of the materials it was made of!

109
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,430
Right?  The materials are the same
as the ones Tom-san used for the Pirate King's ship!

110
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,160
And the blueprints were my greatest masterpiece!

111
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,250
Leave the coating of the ship to me.
I'll handle it with a Don!

112
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,260
That's really helpful, uh... what's your name again?

113
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,710
I'm Den.

114
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,060
Den-san!

115
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,220
Still, you really don't look like him.

116
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,660
You're a merman, and not a blowfish either.

117
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,100
Since you're Tom-san's little brother,

118
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,800
I thought you'd look more like him.

119
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,420
That's a very human way of thinking.

120
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,080
After all, you surface-dwellers usually resemble the members of your family.

121
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,780
But that's not the case with fishmen.

122
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,980
The genes of Fishmen and Merfolk
carry the memories of their distant ancestors.

123
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,990
If an octopus mermaid gives birth to a shark merman,

124
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,110
that just means that someone
in the mermaid's ancestry was a shark merman.

125
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,880
Whatever kind of child one gives birth to,
nobody finds it strange here on Fishman Island.

126
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,050
Because of that,

127
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:16,320
we can't understand why you humans discriminate against each other based on appearances.

128
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,730
By the way, were there any robots among your ancestors?

129
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm human!

130
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,530
Human?

131
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,570
Oh, so your ancestors were humanoid robots?

132
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,290
I'm just a normal human!

133
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,190
Well, it doesn't matter.

134
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,720
Yes it does!

135
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,590
Oh, right.
I read about you and Iceberg-kun in a letter.

136
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,090
Oh, so old Kokoro wrote you a letter?

137
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,750
So I'm aware of what happened.

138
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,820
My brother lived in his own way, with a Don, to the very end!

139
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,240
And you came here to tell me that in person.

140
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,070
He had a good apprentice.

141
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,680
You're making me blush.

142
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh, so you are a robot after all!

143
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,190
Well, let's just say I'm a perversion of nature
and leave it at that.

144
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,420
Oh, and I noticed that someone's
been sitting over there for a while now.

145
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,030
Oh, that's Boss Jinbe.

146
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,060
Boss?

147
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,030
Apparently he's waiting for someone.

148
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,960
He's a wanted man,
so he can't enter the kingdom itself.

149
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
Intruders!

150
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,890
How did you make it all the way to here?!

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,470
I don't believe it!

152
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,230
We thought we'd have to fight our way in here,
but Neptune and all the soldiers are already tied up!

153
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,520
I never would have expected
a present like this to be waiting for us!

154
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,440
Quite the surprise.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,290
That face!

156
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,340
What's he doing here?!

157
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,750
So you finally show yourself, despicable Vander Decken!

158
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,990
And that's...

159
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,990
Hody Jones from the Fishman District!

160
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,430
Why has he come back here?

161
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,620
Hody?  Wasn't he...

162
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,560
He used to be a rather proficient soldier in our army.

163
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,360
Is this some kind of trap?
It seems too good to be true!

164
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,600
We just keep getting more and more guests.

165
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,950
What a lively palace.

166
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,690
You must be in league with them, right?!

167
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,210
Huh?!

168
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,590
You invited them here, didn't you?!

169
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,800
Hey!  If you guys hadn't brought us,
we wouldn't even be here in the first place!

170
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,560
Who are those tough-looking guys?!

171
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,630
Hey!  At least give us back our weapons!

172
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,810
Please!  Let us fight!

173
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,820
Vander Decken!
Now that you are here, I have no doubts!

174
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,490
You are the culprit!  Give me back my daughter!

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,490
Give her back when I haven't even married her yet?
You're getting ahead of yourself, Father.

176
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,660
Do not call me Father!

177
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,710
Where did you take Shirahoshi?!  She had better be safe!

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,340
What's with the attitude?
You make it sound like the princess isn't here.

179
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,090
Don't play dumb with me!

180
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,720
Who else could be responsible for the princess suddenly disappearing from her room?!

181
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,270
My Shirahoshi has disappeared?!

182
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,570
She's mine!  She's my daughter -jamon!

183
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
Neptune-sama, don't get so worked up
over this guy's nonsense.

184
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,250
Calm down, Decken.

185
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,860
Look.  The humans you threw,
aiming for the Mermaid Princess, arrived here.

186
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,040
That means, at the very least, that Princess Shirahoshi was still here when you threw them.

187
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,140
Help.

188
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,780
Besides, whether or not what they're saying is true,

189
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,920
you have a way of finding out where she is.

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,610
Finding out... where she is?

191
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,830
Indeed!  Hody, you're pretty smart...

192
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,160
I presume!

193
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,110
Is he leaving?

194
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,250
What's he planning to do?

195
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,430
Now, coral!  Fly toward Shirahoshi!

196
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,730
It's not flying toward Koukaku Tower!

197
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,570
Whoever it is trying to stand in the way
of our ten years of love...

198
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,280
They must die!

199
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,150
And so, he let out a gigantic fart!

200
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,870
Luffy-sama, you mustn't use such vulgar words.

201
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,270
Really?

202
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,540
If anyone else is trying to take you as their own...

203
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,210
then I would sooner see you dead, soaked in your own blood!

204
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,280
Shirahoshi!

205
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,330
Vander Decken went after Shirahoshi!

206
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,190
Neptune-sama!

207
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,250
I'm begging you -jamon!
I'll give you whatever you want!

208
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,510
Just let me go after Decken!

209
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
I'll give you all of our treasure.

210
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,350
You can even take my soldiers' lives if you want!

211
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,930
Hey, Your Majesty!

212
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,540
He'll catch Shirahoshi!

213
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,990
My beloved Shirahoshi!

214
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,610
How pitiful, Neptune.

215
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,490
I never thought that my destined enemies,
the Straw Hat Pirates,

216
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,620
would assist us in overthrowing Ryuuguu Palace!

217
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,610
Destined enemies?

218
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,720
That's Arlong's mark!

219
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,980
Jinbe told me that there was
unrest in the Fishman District...

220
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,400
But I never would have guessed that you, a former member of the Neptune Army, would be behind it!

221
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
You should be ashamed, Hody!

222
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,150
Ashamed?

223
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,480
That would make sense, if  I'd ever taken
 pride in being part of the Neptune Army.

224
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:35,340
But the only reason I worked for you as a soldier was to gain combat experience.  That's all.

225
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,810
You wretch!

226
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,300
It worked.  I've become strong.

227
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
What?!

228
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,160
It's not like you bothered to
watch over every part of Fishman Island.

229
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,200
Ever since I was a kid,

230
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,430
I've seen fishmen being oppressed by humans.

231
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,650
You guys make me want to puke!

232
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,300
No matter how many of you we take out,

233
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,430
you pathetic humans, who can't even
breathe underwater, just keep coming back at us!

234
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,110
I looked up to Arlong's ambition, to knock those humans off their pedestals and teach them a lesson!

235
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,870
We are the ones who will continue his plan...

236
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
The New Fishman Pirates!

237
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,800
Ever since Arlong went to East Blue
to conquer the world,

238
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,430
I've been training so that
I could become his right-hand man.

239
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,520
But it never happened,
due to a certain group of humans.

240
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,690
Are these fishmen trying to carry out Arlong's plan?!

241
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,900
What?!  Arlong?!

242
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,690
Just kidding.
In fact, I've never eaten any Arlong before.

243
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,700
That hurt!  Usopp-san, why did you kick me?

244
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,390
Enough talking.  Let's get down to business.

245
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,480
Get out of my way!

246
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,020
W-What?

247
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
{\an8}Rough Shark

248
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,110
What insane power!  What is he doing?!

249
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,620
This is bad!  This is so very, very bad!

250
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,320
Nami-chin?

251
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,390
Caimie, I have a favor to ask.

252
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,410
That's his natural strength, right?

253
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah.  He hasn't taken any Energy Steroids yet.

254
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,030
He crushed the wall!

255
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,350
Damn it!  The palace will be flooded again!

256
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,190
This is terrible!  Especially for me!

257
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,190
We're going to drown!

258
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,550
Oh no, water drops!

259
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,450
Get back!  He's about to use it!

260
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,220
{\an8}Shark Archery

261
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,220
The water drops turned into arrows!

262
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,910
You filth!  Attacking my men at random!

263
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,010
Cease this, you fool!

264
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,950
Your Majesty!  Don't!

265
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,660
Never -jamon!  You are my vassals -jamon!

266
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,230
Neptune-sama!

267
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,560
What a fool!  A king shielding his underlings?

268
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,770
You really aren't fit to be a king!

269
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,480
Your Majesty!

270
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,840
Damn you, Hody!

271
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,910
This is awful!  They can't even fight back!

272
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,350
This guy is on a totally different level from Arlong!

273
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,360
N-No!  Wait, Boss Hody!  Don't-

274
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,700
He used his companion as a shield!  He's the worst!

275
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,270
Hey, you guys.  Untie the soldiers.

276
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,690
Our negotiations with this country have broken down.

277
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,500
We promised to return all the hostages unharmed, but we couldn't keep that promise.

278
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,370
How dutiful.

279
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,190
Right, I got it.

280
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,280
Oh no, my foot!

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,270
My strength is fading!  Help me, Nami-san!

282
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,270
What?  Where is Nami-san?

283
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,270
Huh?  Nami?

284
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,780
Where'd they go?  Caimie isn't here either.

285
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,140
Jeez... First Luffy disappears, and now Nami?

286
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,380
But freeing these guys is more important right now.

287
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,500
Hang on for just a little longer, Brook!

288
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,130
This is such a strain on my bones.

289
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,880
Please, hurry and escape.

290
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,550
I leave the task of untying the rest to you.
I have no strength left.

291
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,460
Untie them!  Pick up your weapons!

292
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,510
Don't let them pull any stupid tricks!

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,020
Crush the Neptune Army and the Straw Hat Pirates!

294
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,230
A surface flower blossomed!

295
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,570
I've never seen that flower before!

296
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,700
Take this.

297
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,620
What's this smell?!

298
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,540
Fools.  How ridiculous.

299
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,360
I can't take it any more.

300
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,380
Zoro!  This place is about to be flooded!

301
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,570
Please, let those two escape from the castle!

302
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,760
What about you?

303
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,330
If he comes after you,
nobody will be able to get away!

304
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,580
Don't get in my way.  This country will be mine.

305
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,370
Hang in there!  You'll be alright!

306
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,060
You have to get off the island!

307
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,730
This isn't the time for you to worry about us!

308
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,820
Just focus on your own injuries right now.

309
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,380
Who are you guys?

310
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,030
Return the mermaids!

311
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,240
Damn humans, you only see us as mere objects!

312
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,270
Huh?  What are you talking about?

313
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,250
Don't play dumb, pirates!

314
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,800
Three young mermaids disappeared
from the southern coast not too long ago!

315
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,140
Where are the girls?!

316
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,300
I don't get it.

317
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,370
Why do you think we're the culprits?!

318
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,310
Granted...

319
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,820
I love mermaids so much
that I really want to kidnap a few...

320
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,820
but I would never actually do it!

321
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,700
See?!  He just said he wanted to kidnap them!

322
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,480
Why would you say that to them?!  Be quiet!

323
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,460
It must be the humans' doing!

324
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,730
Get out of here!

325
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,800
There's still some left in this!  Don't waste it!

326
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,550
Silence, human!

327
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,340
Huh?  Sanji, Chopper!

328
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,830
Hey, Sanji!  You've recovered from your nosebleed?

329
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,470
Luffy, is that you?

330
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,530
What's with the puffer fish?

331
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,750
A-Are they your friends, Luffy-sama?

332
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,510
They're my crewmates!

333
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,550
Those people are...

334
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,460
Look!  Their captain is here!

335
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,290
That damn Straw Hat!
He's the leader of the mermaid kidnappers!

336
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,300
I mustn't be seen!
Megalo, close your mouth a little more!

337
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,850
I'm going down there for a bit.

338
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,110
What?

339
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,310
He jumped down!

340
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,320
Hachi!  Is it really you?

341
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,280
Straw Hat.

342
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,300
What happened to you?!

343
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,590
Who did this to you?!

344
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,280
Well... He won't say.

345
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,680
You have to... leave the island.

346
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,790
He keeps insisting we do that.

347
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,090
But I thought Straw Hat
was holding Ryuuguu Palace under siege?

348
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,510
They're mermaid kidnappers!

349
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,110
He must have left his underlings at the castle,
and come to kidnap more!

350
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,970
His ultimate goal must be to kidnap Princess Shirahoshi!

351
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,790
That's ridiculous.  There's no way he could do that.

352
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,480
The princess is a giant Big Kiss Mermaid.

353
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
Not to mention, she's the
only daughter of Sea God Neptune.

354
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,900
Even if he wanted to kidnap her,
who would be crazy enough to try?

355
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,660
What's with that puffer fish?

356
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,910
No!

357
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,450
Whaaaaat?!

358
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:04,870
Huh?!

359
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,670
Princess Shirahoshi?!

360
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,720
Uh... Well... Um...

361
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,010
You found me!

362
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,440
She's huge!  By "Princess", do they mean...

363
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,540
The Mermaid Princess?!

364
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,030
Huh?  What is it?

365
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,440
Is there somebody behind me?

366
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,540
Don't do it, Sanji!
Whatever you do, don't turn around!

367
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,700
What are you talking about?

368
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,240
If you turn around, you'll die, Sanji!

369
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,200
Aw, man...

370
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,480
The Mermaid Princess has been kidnapped!

371
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,860
P-Princess Shirahoshi!

372
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:17,130
She... really has been... kidnapped!

373
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,950
Hey!  Wimp!
Why'd you get out of the shark?

374
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,500
I-I'm sorry!

375
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Luffy-sama, please don't be so angry with me.

376
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,050
That bastard made the Princess cry!
He really is just pirate scum!

377
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,820
Our poor Princess Shirahoshi!

378
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,490
Princess?

379
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,100
Wait a second... Princess.

380
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,030
They can't mean...

381
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,440
Don't do it, Sanji!

382
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,280
You absolutely must not turn around!

383
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,000
Wait...

384
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,220
You mean to tell me
that if I turn around and look behind me...

385
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,040
then the Mermaid Princess will be there?

386
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,240
That's right!  She's here!

387
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,670
That's why you absolutely
must not turn around, Sanji!

388
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,420
You nearly died from seeing regular mermaids. { def: to be fair, it was a face full of mermaid boob that did it }

389
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,550
So if you see the Mermaid Princess...

390
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,440
you'll definitely lose
every last drop of blood in your body.

391
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,690
It'll be the end of the line for you!

392
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,340
The Mermaid Princess.
The most beautiful woman in the world.

393
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,660
It's said that even the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock fails to compare.

394
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,360
The woman who is held above all other Mermaids...

395
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,710
is behind me right now?

396
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,490
Just forget about her!
I'm begging you... Please don't look behind you!

397
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,100
Chopper.

398
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,540
Instead of continuing to live without ever
fulfilling the dream that's within my grasp...

399
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,840
I choose to fulfill that dream...

400
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,860
and die!

401
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,550
What?!  Isn't your dream supposed to be All Blue?!

402
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,970
Stop!

403
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,420
Sanji!

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,050
Huh?  T-T-This...

405
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,390
Even my dreams were wretched, when compared to this. {Gil : Line seems to go on past the keyframe. Timing check?}

406
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:55,310
This paragon of elegance.  She truly is...

407
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,820
the embodiment of absolute beauty.

408
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,130
He turned to stone!

409
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,930
I thought he'd bleed to death from a nosebleed.

410
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,310
Petrification?  That's a new symptom.

411
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,310
Maybe it's a side effect
of the Okama blood transfusion?

412
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,110
How can I explain?  Luffy-sama was only...

413
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,690
Hey, are you okay?!

414
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,770
You gotta tell me, who the hell did this to you?

415
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,550
Hey, what are you guys doing?

416
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,620
We got 'em!

417
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,390
We got the Straw Hat Pirates!

418
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,980
We're fishermen!
We risk our lives every day, fighting the Sea Kings!

419
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,820
Pirates are like nothing!

420
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,530
Don't try and pick a fight
with the Fishman Island fishermen!

421
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,890
The fishermen nabbed 'em!

422
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,820
Good job!

423
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,240
You guys are fishermen?  We aren't fish, you know!

424
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,040
Hey!  I remember you now!

425
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,170
Long ago you were with Arlong, weren't you?  You're a traitor!

426
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,380
You'll be fine now, Princess!

427
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,090
We'll hand 'em over to the Ammo Knights, and then it'll be off with their heads!

428
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,430
But... that isn't exactly what happened...
You see, Luffy-sama was just...

429
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,410
Hey!  You guys!  Something's flying this way!

430
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,140
Over there!

431
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,480
What?!  Don't say such dumb things!
You can't fool us!

432
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,090
Over there!  Hey!

433
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,710
There really is something flying this way!

434
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,410
Huh?!

435
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,150
You don't mean...

436
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,640
Vander Decken!

437
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,920
I've found you, I presume!

438
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,900
Shirahoshi!

439
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,090
Vander Decken-sama.

440
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,270
After hiding for so long,
he's finally showed himself on the island!

441
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,270
Princess!  Please escape!  We'll hold him here!

442
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,600
Give me your answer, Shirahoshi!

443
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,490
If it's yes, then you don't have to die!

444
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,420
Shall we...

445
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,740
get married?!

446
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,970
You mean to tell me that the man who's been throwing weapons at the Princess for the past ten years...

447
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,300
was just stalking her with marriage proposals?!

448
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,220
There's a limit to how crazy you can be,
Vander Decken!

449
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,640
Because of you, the Princess has spent the last
ten years scared out of her mind, fearing for her life!

450
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,810
I can't believe that you'd...

451
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,600
Give me your answer!  Shirahoshi!

452
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,620
It'll be a yes, I presume!

453
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,950
Well, you see...

454
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,660
What's that?  Is it a yes?

455
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,410
You're just not my type.

456
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,480
Huh?

457
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,660
Huh?!  That's her reason?!

458
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,440
Why you...

459
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,210
You've been leading me on for ten years!  Who the hell are you planning to marry?!

460
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,220
If you aren't going to be mine,
then it hurts me just seeing you alive!

461
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,720
Die, Shirahoshi!

462
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,970
Please, Princess Shirahoshi, we beg you to escape!

463
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,690
Quickly!  Even if we have to sacrifice our lives...

464
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,510
Don't run away!  Stay there, Wimp!

465
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,430
What're you saying?!  As if she'd trust a pirate!

466
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,730
That's right, you're working with Decken, aren't you? {lit. an accomplice of}

467
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,480
Do you think you can just order the Princess to die?

468
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,400


469
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,310
If you're too far from me,
I won't be able to protect you!

470
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,790
Y-Yes!  I'll stay right here!

471
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,710
Princess!

472
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,220
You really think you can
threaten the Princess like that?!

473
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,840
You pirate scum!

474
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,130
Sorry guys, this is nothing personal, but...

475
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,570
you're in the way!

476
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,730
Luffy!

477
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,900
He can do that even when he's tied up?!

478
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,670
This is between me and my beloved Shirahoshi.  Why must you get in the way?

479
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,420
You must be the one who took her...

480
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,680
So you're the one?!

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,760
The one who threw all that stuff at Wimp!

482
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:58,530
I'll take both of your lives then!
I'll put the two of you together and cut you into four!

483
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,100
Just try it!

484
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,610
L-Let me go!

485
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,600
He... took out Vander Decken?!

486
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,880
He's still moving.  Now's our chance to capture him!

487
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,770
Shark!  Wake up!

488
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,110
Sanji!

489
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,570
Are you okay?

490
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,760
He turned into stone a little while ago, but it looks like
he's in a state of bliss now.  He's conscious.

491
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,630
I see.  Got it!

492
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,390
Mermaid Princess.

493
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,050
Is this heaven?  Is it paradise?

494
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,130
My dream's been realized.  I can die a happy man.

495
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,730
But wasn't your dream supposed to be All Blue?

496
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,900
Hurry up, Wimp!

497
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,820
O-O-Okay!

498
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:32,850
B-B-But... if it wouldn't trouble you too much,
could you perhaps not raise your voice so much?

499
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,390
It's making me really anxious.

500
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,810
I don't know why, but it seems like
we're no longer welcome on this island.

501
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,780
We should get out of here soon.

502
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,830
Thanks, Wimp!

503
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,740
We're outta here!

504
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,120
O-Okay!

505
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,340
Princess!  Why did you undo the rope?

506
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,870
That pirate scum... he's threatening her again!

507
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,130
I'm terribly sorry, everyone.
But I'll be back in time for dinner!

508
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,300
Huh?!

509
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,940
Shark forward!

510
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,450
Get out of the way, trash!

511
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,070
I ain't lettin' you get away that easily!

512
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,190
Wadatsumi!

513
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,870
I've seen him before.

514
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,240
He's the Umibouzu that attacked the Sunny!  He's one of Decken's underlings!

515
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,630
It's the Great Monk!

516
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,390
Wadatsumi!

517
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,310
Knock them out of the sky!

518
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,240
You got it!

519
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:21,430
My tooth!  My front tooth!  It broke!

520
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,320
Owie!  Owie!

521
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,860
That oversized brat!

522
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,200
Alright!

523
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,170
We're off, Wimp!

524
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,330
To the Sea Forest!

525
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,050
Okay!

526
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:46,300
Boss Hody!  Two females, a pirate and a mermaid,
have escaped from Ryuuguu Palace!

527
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,090
Let them go.

528
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,120
Nami-chin, is this really okay?
Leaving Zoro-chin and the others like that...

529
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,130
It's not like you could carry everyone.

530
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,680
Well, that's true, but...

531
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,670
Don't worry about it!

532
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,520
Worrying won't do any good!

533
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,930
I know that everyone's strong, but...

534
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:12,840
You see, Hody's not just strong.
His ideas are dangerous too, or so Hacchin says.

535
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,980
You know, in the past two years,
we've all gotten way stronger than we were before.

536
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,620
But more importantly,
what kind of person is the former Shichibukai Jinbe?

537
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,500
Huh?

538
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,240
Well, Boss Jinbe... He's a pirate, but,

539
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,460
he's so popular that he used to come and go
from Ryuuguu Palace as he pleased.

540
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,740
Yeah.  But he was in
the same crew as Arlong, wasn't he?

541
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,640
Hody said that he's going to
pick up where Arlong left off.

542
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,980
Jinbe left a message for Luffy: "Don't fight Hody."

543
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,700
I think I understand what he meant.

544
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,360
Huh?  You don't think that
he just meant that it would be dangerous?

545
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,900
I just hope Zoro and the others don't anger Hody so much that we get dragged even further into this mess.

546
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,990
At any rate, I wanna see Jinbe.

547
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,030
He said "I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."

548
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,120
This incident is going to have
a profound impact on the kingdom.

549
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,100
There's even a chance that there will be riots so huge that they shake the kingdom to its core.

550
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,370
I think he knew all of this.

551
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,940
Boss Jinbe knew that?

552
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,800
Caimie.

553
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Take me to the Sea Forest!

554
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,160
Okay!

555
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,730
All men, listen up!

556
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,970
Yes sir!  We shall immediately remove
Hody and his crew from the premises. {they just say, "and that crew." It's ambiguous as to which crew they mean, but I think they mean Hody's.}

557
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,020
That's no good -jamon!

558
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,820
Huh?!

559
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,290
I cannot fight properly.

560
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,280
As it stands now, you would all just die in vain.

561
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,760
You shall surrender the palace to them at once.

562
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,540
We will join up with Fukaboshi,
and then come up with a plan to recapture the palace.

563
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,580
Surrender the palace?!
Are you serious, Neptune-sama?

564
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,180
That Zoro... What do you think you can do
against a Fishman in the water?!

565
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:12,240
Usopp-san, my power's fading.
It feels like I'm gonna drown and die at any moment.

566
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,370
You're already dead.

567
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,440
Indeed.

568
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,970
Zoro!

569
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:56,500
The Ryuuguu palace falls into Hody's hands.

570
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,700
Meanwhile, Jinbe tells everyone about him and Arlong,

571
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,580
while parts of Fishman Island fall into chaos.

572
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,980
Next time on One Pace:

573
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,190
{\an5}At the Sea Forest!
Arlong and Hody
