00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,340
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,640
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,380
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,870
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,320
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,820
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,490
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,070
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,720
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610

We Go!

Men!

46
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,740
For now, we shall retreat!

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,690
Yeah!

48
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,900
Roger that, Captain Vander Decken!

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Angler!  Wadatsumi!  Pull the ship!

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,350
G-Gotcha!

51
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,520
This is terrible!

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,100
Luffy, tell the Kraken
to get us away from here as fast as possible!

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,070
Sure!

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,310
Hey, Surume!

55
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,130
Wait!  That's not necessary!

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,150
He's already running for his life!

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,790
I never thought I'd see
a legendary beast reduced to this!

58
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,170
That's a big help!  You're not so bad after all!

59
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,640
What a horrible way to run. { def: rediculuous? }

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,850
Don't say that!
That just shows how terrifying these eruptions are!

61
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,250
I'd really like to see an eruption!

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,450
Run to the front of the ship!

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,320
That won't help!
A few meters doesn't change anything!

64
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,910
The magma is flowing along the ocean floor! {And DAMN is it moving fast. I was led to believe that magma flowed a little, uh, slower?}

65
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,660
The water temperature is rising!

66
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,450
It's like we're in a cooking pot!

67
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,280
Hot! Hot!

68
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,280
It's gonna start boiling!

69
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,390
The ghost ship and the Umibouzu!

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,190
Run, Surume!

71
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,600
The currents have started swirling
because of the temperature difference!

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,030
Nami-san.

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,550
Which way is Fishman Isl-

74
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,100
You're still having indecent thoughts, even now?!

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,210
We have to keep moving straight forward!

76
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,800
Just a little further!

77
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Into that ocean trench!

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,330
A vertical drop!  Are you serious?!

79
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,300
It's even darker than darkness!

80
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,970
Is Fishman Island really down there?!

81
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,230
It's so hot behind us!  Too hot!

82
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,980
It's pitch black ahead of us!  Scary!

83
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,640
It's obvious that there are even more monsters down there!

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,300
We'll never make it out alive!

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,740
Luffy!  That darkness drops straight to hell,
it's like a bottomless pot! {Gil: Just to be sure...he is saying "pot" and not "pit" right?}

86
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,150
Leap in!

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,150
Surume!

88
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,920
Another eruption!

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,240
What's that?!
Something's coming at us from above!

90
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,780
Boulders?!

91
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,910
A landslide?!

92
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,840
It's a rockfall!  Look out! { def: tlc: avalanche in english means snow, apparently that's different in japanese }

93
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,170
It's collapsing because of the eruption just now!

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,010
Dodge them, Surume!

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,520
I'll leave the bubble and cut them down!

96
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,450
Luffy, hold on tight to me!

97
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,750
Sure, leave it to me!

98
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,940
Zoro, no!

99
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,350
Hey, let me go!

100
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,590
Why are you stopping him, Robin?!

101
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,260
We're 8 kilometers below the surface!

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,720
If you leave the bubble,
you'll be crushed by the water pressure!

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,570
Then what do we do?!

104
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,540
Deadly Green Star!

105
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,900

106
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,370

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,150
The rockfall...

108
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,290
stopped!

109
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,860
That's amazing, Usopp!

110
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,120
That'll slow it down for a few seconds.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,140
Get away from here while you have the chance, Surume!

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,620
We're safe!

113
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,190
Usopp, that was amazing!

114
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,810
Indeed, very quick thinking!

115
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,810
It was easy!

116
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,810
You saved us!

117
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,540
Surume!  You did great!

118
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,730
Surume!  Su-

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,260
10 kilometers below the surface: The Depths (Bottom of the trench)

120
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,750
W-We're safe.

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,620
Light?  Even though we're this far below the surface?

122
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,620
It's so bright!  My eyes are blinded...

123
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,830
Though I have no eyes that can be blinded.

124
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,600
Hey, you guys!  Come and look at this!

125
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,680
Up there!  Above us!

126
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,930
It's too bright.  I can't see it very well.

127
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,600
Hey, Nami!  Is that it?

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Yes, there's no doubt about it.
The compass is pointing towards that island!

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,620
That's...

130
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,250
Fishman Island!

131
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,080
It's huge!

132
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,170
It's covered in an enormous bubble!  And there are clouds on the inside?

133
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,520
Maybe there's air in there!

134
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,980
We did it!  We're here!

135
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,670
One of the most famous spots on the Grand Line!

136
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,440
Oh, so we're here?

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
The island where the mermaids dance...

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
The beautiful mermaid princess...

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,830
Finally, I'm here!  In the paradise I've dreamed of since I was a kid!

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,570
Mermaids!  Mermai-

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,780
Sanji!  It's hopeless!
Just imagining it caused him to become like this?!

142
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm so sorry, Sanji!
I couldn't rehabilitate you in time!

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,170
It'd be better if you didn't meet the real mermaids.

144
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,990
Doctor!  Meeting the mermaids of Fishman Island is his dream!

145
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,430
But if he meets them, he'll die!

146
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,510
Oh no!

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,820
I don't mind.

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,920
Sanji!

149
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,820
I don't want to live the rest of my life
without fulfilling this dream.

150
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,170
I'd rather see the mermaids and die from over-excitement!

151
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,870
You're the worst!

152
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,900
I will meet the mermaids!

153
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,220
I'm so excited!  I wonder what sort of meat
they eat on Fishman Island?

154
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,240
Luffy, could you wipe that drool off your face
and ask Surume a favor?

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
Let's search for the entrance to Fishman Island.

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,520
Hey, what's with those guys?!

157
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,570
Who are they?!

158
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,450
It's a herd of sea monsters!

159
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,090
We're done for!  And we made it so far!

160
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,130
These sea monsters are so...

161
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,890
cool!

162
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,890
Someone's riding them!

163
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,410
Why are you letting those humans boss you around...

164
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,040
Kraken?

165
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,870
What are you doing, Surume?!  Carry us for the last stretch too!

166
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,600
You're the Straw Hat Crew, aren't you?

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,340
We know the name well...

168
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,860
You're the pirates who took out Arlong's crew.

169
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,910
If that's all you'd done,
our reaction would be obvious.

170
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,710
But of all things, two years ago you defended Hachi-san, a former member of Arlong's crew...

171
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,640
and from what I hear, you even beat up
one of those despicable Celestial Dragons!

172
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,170
Acts worthy of Fisher Tiger,
the hero of Fishman Island who we all admire! { def: any time someone uses "whom" they come off a little stiff. dunno if that's appropriate for Hammond } {Gil: It doesn't feel right to me.}

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,820
{\an8}Hey, tell me...

176
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,880
New Fishman Pirates · Hitman
 Hyouzou

177
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,880
{\an8}Are you friends, or foes?

178
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,450
I'll let you choose...

179
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,130
Will you join us, the New Fishman Pirates?

180
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,850
Or will you refuse us?

181
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,810
If you say no, we'll sink you right here and now.

182
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,980
What?!

183
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,040
Franky, refill the fuel.

184
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,660
Huh?  What are you planning?

185
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,600
There's no way Luffy and the others will do what those guys say.

186
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,770
Even so, we're 10 kilometers underwater.

187
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,340
We can't even fight back down here.  There's no chance of winning. { def: "We'd have no chance of winning"  gives us three sentences in a row starting with "We". }

188
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,840
So let's flee!

189
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,300
We'll use up all the air left on the ship in one last Coup de Burst to charge straight toward the island!

190
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,150
Are you serious?!

191
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,720
It's either that, or we came all this way just to die.

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,470
True.  I can't see any other way to survive this.

193
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,820
Right!  I'll go fill up the fuel tanks!

194
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,780
Franky!  You steer the ship!

195
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,840
You got it!  I'll handle it superbly!

196
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,170
So, will you become our underling, Straw Hat Luffy?

197
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,580
No way.

198
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,140
Moron!

199
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,090
You refuse... You reject my invitation to join the New Fishman Pirates?!

200
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,640
In that case, you are enemies of the fishmen!  Just a group of sinful humans!

201
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,570
Why should I have to be your underling?!

202
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,060
Luffy!  You really shouldn't taunt them!

203
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,820
What a shame.
There's no way I can let you pass now. {Gil: Changed "In that case" because he only said this a few lines ago.}

204
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,300
Sea lion!

205
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,040
Energy Room

206
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,040
{\an8}Franky, we're good to go!

207
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,110
You wanna fight?!

208
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,580
Do it, Franky!

209
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,850
The Sunny is a lion too!

210
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,020
Let's settle the score some other day, sea lion!

211
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,640
Here goes...

212
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,130
Coup de Burst!

213
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,130
{\an8}Burst Blow

214
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,000
The ship...

215
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,050
The air... is disappearing!

216
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,370
I'm gonna be flattened...

217
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,280
Endure it!  Until we break through to Fishman Island!

218
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,900
What is with that ship?!

219
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,030
We're breaking through!

220
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,570
Wait for me, my dear mermaids!

221
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,290
The coating came off!
It was absorbed by the giant bubble!

222
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,540
This bubble has two layers!

223
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,530
A normal ship would plummet to the bottom in this air-filled layer!

224
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,780
We're gonna use another Burst to get across!

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,380
Hold on tight!

226
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,540
Water...!

227
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,280
What a strong current!

228
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,230
Help me...

229
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,280
I can't breathe.

230
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,810
We've got four Devil Fruit users here!

231
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,160
Stretch out... your hands!

232
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,050
Nami-san!  Robin-chan!

233
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,080
Dammit!  I can't fight the current!

234
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,420
What a reckless way to enter the country... They might have killed themselves.

235
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,730
Wanna follow them, Hammond?

236
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,350
We can't be sure if they're dead or alive.

237
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,140
We should go, just in case.

238
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,770
I don't want the Neptune Army to find them before we do.

239
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,740
But first, let's return to the Noah, and inform the boss about this.

240
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,690
We should let him know that Straw Hat,
the one who shattered Arlong-san's ambitions, is here!

241
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,550
The Depths of Fishman Island

242
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,190
See?

243
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,800
Look!

244
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,650
I saw it!

245
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,780
I didn't see it!

246
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,070
Didn't you see it?

247
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,140
So what if I saw it?

248
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,620
See, he moved!

249
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,800
He moved!

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
He didn't move!

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,870
Didn't he move?

252
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,440
So what if he moved?

253
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,610
Alright!  He's awake!

254
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,440
Luffy!

255
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,000
Luffy-chin!

256
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm so glad you're alright!

257
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,960
How do you feel?

258
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,530
If it isn't Caimie!  It's been so long!

259
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,170
You're even cuter than you were
the last time I saw you, Caimie-chwan!

260
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,060
Have we arrived at Fishman Island?

261
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,760
Yeah!  Apparently the mermaids saved us
when we were about to drown!

262
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,120
Indeed!  There's no point in hiding it.  We were all unconscious until now.

263
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,500
This is Caimie-chan's house.

264
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,350
Here, your hat.

265
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,840
Caimie's house, huh?

266
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,220
I'm sorry.  I was planning to meet up with you,

267
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,890
but I didn't think you were coming until next month.

268
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't sweat it!  Where are the others?

269
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,300
Well... It appears we were separated.

270
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,470
I wonder if they're all okay?

271
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,840
Really?

272
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,310
Well, I'm sure they'll manage somehow.

273
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,970
Bones won't be much good in the water,

274
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,410
but they've got Robo and Green with them.

275
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm sure they're fine.

276
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,620
I tried to reach them for as long as I could, but we were the only ones dragged to the bottom.

277
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,450
I really want to see the others soon.

278
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,010
Ah, here.  You must be cold, right?

279
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,360
I made some soup, so drink up and get warm.

280
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,400
Ta-daah!  Cold seaweed soup!

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,540
It's delicious.

282
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,670
Cold... soup?  {Yes COLD soup is able to keep you warm, silly Usopp. -FAb}

283
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,520
Cold soup won't warm you up at all!

284
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,130
What am I going to do?!

285
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,750
I got it wrong!

286
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,790
It's fine, Caimie-chan.

287
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,690
On the contrary, it does warm me up!

288
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,180
What do you mean "On the contrary"?

289
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,330
H-Hey!  Sanji, I want some too!

290
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,110
Your clothes are dry!

291
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,130
They're dry!

292
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,610
They're not dry yet!

293
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,080
Aren't they dry?

294
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,400
So what if they're dry?

295
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,040
You dried our clothes?

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,070
Thanks!

297
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,850
Thank you.

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,580
By the way, who are you guys?

299
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Oh, they're my friends.

300
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,660
The Killifish Mermaid Quintuplets

301
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,670
I'm Ichika!

302
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,870
{\an8}One-ka, Two-ka, Three-ka, Four-ka, and Four-ka Two

303
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm Nika!

304
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,530
I'm Sanka!

305
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm Yonka!

306
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,870
I'm Yonka Two!

307
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,660
Shouldn't that be Goka?!

308
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,660
{\an8}Five-ka

309
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,980
They're fast swimmers, and quite well-informed too.

310
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,170
Oh, really?

311
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,060
This is the bottom of the Mermaid Bay.

312
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,360
We're in the ladies' dormitory of
the city's Mermaid Café, so I have lots of friends here.

313
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,710
L-Ladies' dormitory?!

314
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,890
It's the café where I work as a waitress.

315
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,000
There are plenty of beautiful mermaids there.

316
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,510
Sanji's...

317
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,110
in big trouble!

318
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,350
Like hell!

319
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,470
He's back!

320
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,210
I...

321
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:20,120
I swore that nosebleeds wouldn't make me
lose consciousness while I was on Fishman Island!

322
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,870
So please... Haven't I suffered enough?

323
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,690
You sure are serious about this.

324
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:29,720
You sure are serious about this.

325
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:29,760
You sure are serious about this.

326
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:29,790
You sure are serious about this.

327
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:29,820
You sure are serious about this.

328
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:29,860
You sure are serious about this.

329
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:29,890
You sure are serious about this.

330
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,200
I know, let's go upstairs!

331
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,250
I'll introduce you to my friends!

332
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,120
It's a turtle!

333
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,950
SEA
TURTLE

334
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,950
It says "Sea Turtle Elevator".

335
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,660
Turtle-chin.  Take us up, please.

336
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,710
These are the underwater Coral Apartments.

337
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,800
My room is on the lowest floor, since it's the cheapest.

338
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,070
The highest levels, where the sun shines,
are the most expensive.

339
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,010
Are you poor?

340
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,010
By the way, what about Hachi and Pappagg?

341
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,010
Hacchin got badly injured about a year ago.

342
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah.  He was protecting the Sunny
on the Sabaody Archipelago, wasn't he?

343
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,320
I heard that his injuries have more or less healed,

344
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,460
but Hacchin was originally a resident of
the Fishman District, so he's recovering there.

345
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,700
Fishman District?

346
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,910
It's kind of a scary place, but if you guys
are with me, I don't mind giving you a tour.

347
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,470
Let's go there after!
I have to meet Hachi and thank him, after all.

348
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,220
Sure, I got it.

349
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,060
Uh... And as for Pappagg...

350
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,100
He's a super-famous designer,

351
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,450
so he's got a huge mansion in Fishverly Hills, the most luxurious part of Fishman Island!

352
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm going there to deliver clams for him today.
Why don't you come along?

353
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,760
Aren't you his owner?

354
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,110
Why don't you live together?

355
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,430
I don't really fit in there.

356
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,370
And the clams in these parts taste better anyway.

357
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,160
Hey, what's that straw-like thing?

358
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,450
Oh, that's...

359
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,240
the Water Road, created by
the bubble craftsmen of the island.

360
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,480
The fishes and merfolk like me ride it.

361
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,820
Just watch!

362
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,620
We've reached the surface!

363
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,590
Look!  I can even swim through the sky!

364
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,060
That looks fun!

365
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,980
Huh?

366
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,080
Hey, wait!  More importantly,
there are clouds and a sky here in the deep sea!

367
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Hey, Caimie!

368
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,090
That was a woman's voice!

369
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,490
Everyone!

370
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,780
Are your friends alright now?
The pirates who drowned, I mean.

371
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,850
You're the ones who
didn't come through the entrance, right?

372
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,580
Hello.  You don't look too scary.

373
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,910
Illegal immigrants?  How wild!  I really like pirates.

374
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
It's almost like a fairy tale world!

375
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,750
The coral continent!  The mermaids' bay!

376
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,480
Sanji is sobbing?!

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,550
He's crying harder than he did when he left the Baratie.

378
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,570
I've finally found it!

379
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,600
This is my All Blue!

380
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,460
Are you really sure about that, Sanji?

381
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,610
I'll introduce them to you.

382
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,280
This is Luffy-chin, the captain!

383
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,720
The crying one is Sanji-chin!

384
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,650
And this is Usopp-chin with the nose!

385
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,700
Chopper-chin the raccoon dog!

386
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,320
I'm a reindeer!

387
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,620
What's wrong?  Why are you crying?

388
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,860
Welcome!  Let's dance together in the ocean!

389
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,380
Oh... I understand now.

390
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,050
There's no way such joy could exist.

391
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,920
I must have died today.

392
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,770
Negative!

393
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,830
Seriously, what happened to you during the past two years?!

394
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,140
This island is the paradise
you've always dreamed of, right?!

395
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,410
Sanji, you're so funny!

396
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,320
This barrel washed ashore with Caimie's friends.
I wonder what's inside it?

397
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,300
Alcohol?  Treasure?

398
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,520
Who knows... It's sealed pretty tight, though.

399
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,940
What do you think?  Should we secretly open it?

400
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,020
So Straw Hat Luffy...

401
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,370
{\an8}has finally come here?

402
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,370
Fishman District "Noah"

403
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,370
Yeah...

404
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,370
W-What should we do, boss?

405
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,920
Bring him here... to me.
