00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,380
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,000
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,680
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,220
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,870
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,310
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,810
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,480
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,050
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

Freedom is our only rule!

Forget our worries, just let the wind blow.

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,530
I'm sure we'll be the first to find One Piece!

so let's never wake them up.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,570
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,540
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,330
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,720
We... made it this far.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,620
We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,470
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,720
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610
The sun in my heart will never set!

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,380
One, two, Sunshine...

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,570
One, two, Sunshine...

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,820
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

42
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,040
We Go!

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,560
{\an5}Into the Depths!
The Kraken and the Caribou Pirates

44
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,800
{\an8}Bro, it's difficult to dig here!

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,650
Sabaody Archipelago

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,950
{\an8}Of course it is.

47
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,340
{\an8}These islands are mostly just tree roots.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,210
Please forgive us!  Don't bury us!

49
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,820
We'll do whatever you want, just don't kill us!

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,700
The captain forced us into it!  That damn Black!

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,480
As soon as we'd joined the crew...

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,200
we planned on taking out...

53
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,040
every last one...

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,540
of the infamous Straw Hat Pirates!

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,170
Drip!

56
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,360
Hey, please stop it!  He'll die!

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,630
You've got Devil Fruit powers?!

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,330
S-Stop, dammit!

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,880
What's with him?!  Is he a Logi-

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,280
Can you believe it?

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,540
I assumed that your faces and physiques had changed, it'd been 2 years after all.

62
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,620
But the pirate, Straw Hat...

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,270
was just a nobody!

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,460
A filthy impostor!

65
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,780
Do you think God will forgive this, Coribou?!

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,310
Dig!  Dig!

67
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,480
Indeed, my friends!  Let's bury 'em all!

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,910
Oh, God!

69
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,680
I will bury these imbeciles!

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,590
Stop!

71
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,990
However, I've seen the real Straw Hat Luffy
with my own eyes.

72
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,930
The former rendezvous point of the Fake Straw Hats

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,030
{\an8}As I said, there was nothing we could do.

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,580
We were up against the Dark King Rayleigh.

75
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,340
He could fight off uncle Kizaru.
What could we have done against him?

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,380
The only ones that escaped from the plaza were the Caribou brothers with their crew...

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,950
and a few members of the fake Straw Hat Pirates.

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,950
We captured everyone else,

79
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,810
but the real Straw Hat Pirates dealt heavy damage
to the 2 Pacifista that I brought.

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,000
They are the same prototypes that cornered them 2 years ago.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,830
Of course, the Pacifistas' strength can't have changed.

82
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,300
The change must have been in those guys!

83
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,150
During their 2-year absence,
they've grown incredibly.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Send word to Navy HQ in the New World.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,880
The Straw Hat Pirates have completely recovered.

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,280
They're gone in the blink of an eye.

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,460
Monkey-chan and the rest sure have become tough.

88
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,080
You were watching?

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,630
Of course.  I am a fan, after all.

90
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,970
Are you remembering something, Ray-san?

91
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,270
Oh, yeah... I guess.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,650
Hey!  That's a nice ship!

93
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,730
It's a stolen ship.
My house burned down, so I'm living here.

94
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,960
I see.  What's your name?

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,350
It's Rayleigh.

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm Roger!  Our meeting here is destiny, Rayleigh!

97
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,760
Wanna come with me and turn the world on its head?

98
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,570
The world?

99
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,110
Who do you think you are?

100
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,140
Get lost.

101
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,400
Maybe there are no coincidences in this world.

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,740
It's possible that everything happens for a reason.

103
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,060
Fate works in mysterious ways.

104
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,470
Whatever the case, Luffy has become a man
worthy to wear that hat.

105
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,250
I suppose it might not be too bad, living a little longer.

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,600
The waters around the Sabaody Archipelago - Beneath the surface

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,600
{\an8}The surface is already so far away.

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,210
What a sight!  We don't get a view this wide
in the submarine.

109
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,550
We're sinking faster and faster!

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,050
Is the water really not gonna come in?  I'm worried!

111
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,790
It feels like we're drifting away from the human world!  I'm tense.

112
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,760
A-Are we gonna be able to return to the surface?

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,510
Not that I'm scared or anything!

114
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,420
The ocean sure is beautiful!

115
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,680
Look at this side!

116
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,390
Trees!  No, roots!

117
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,540
Yeah... Now that I think about it, the
Sabaody Archipelago is one giant mangrove, after all.

118
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,990
The splendor of nature!

119
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,050
I've already seen it.

120
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,880
Yeah, 'cause you got on the wrong ship!

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,270
Shut up!  Let us be in awe here!

122
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,740
I can hardly believe that the roots
stretch all the way to the ocean floor.

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,610
They're so big, I'm speechless.

124
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,970
Hey, Chopper...
There's something behind those trees!

125
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,940
It's humongous!

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,570
I'm so excited!  An adventure beneath the sea!

127
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,420
It's like a dream!

128
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,150
Oh, fish!

129
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,900
I think I can catch them!

130
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,050
There are some tasty looking fish over here too.

131
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Cut it out, you two!

132
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,450
What if the soap bubble breaks?!

133
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,450
I'm gonna kill you if you do that again!

134
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,170
Nami-san, before these two do something else stupid,

135
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,960
could you tell us how this coating works?

136
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,100
I guess so, Sanji-kun.

137
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,670
Rayleigh-san gave me some notes, after all.

138
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,740
So, let me explain it to you all.

139
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,840
She moved!  A real life beauty!

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,390
Sanji!

141
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,690
It's breaking!  Breaking!  Breaking!

142
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,340
Just how far can you be propelled by a nosebleed?!

143
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,780
Sanji got thrown into the sea!

144
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,370
Sanji!

145
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,970
Come back!

146
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,390
The ocean!  My strength is fading...

147
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,210
Hang in there!

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,890
What happened to you, Sanji?!

149
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,090
It's like you've developed
a crippling weakness to women!

150
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,690
It's not like you!

151
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,560
How sad.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,510
What could have happened these last 2 years,
to turn the lady-loving Sanji-san into this?

153
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,430
At this rate, once he meets the mermaids he was longing to see,

154
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,160
he might die from blood loss.

155
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,500
We'll have to get
a blood transfusion for him on Fishman Island.

156
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,750
I wonder if fishmen and mermen have the same blood types as humans.

157
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,840
So basically, like we just saw,

158
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,890
the soap-bubble surrounding this ship has the same properties as the ones on the Sabaody Archipelago?

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,240
Don't just calmly continue your analysis of soap-bubbles!

160
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,000
Indeed.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,130
Fundamentally, they're the same.

162
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,750
They'll stretch to a certain extent,
and after that, you'll pierce through them.

163
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,150
In a worst-case scenario,

164
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,170
if we're attacked by sea monsters, we can fire a cannonball at them.

165
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,000
The bubble won't break!

166
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,750
Then what would it take for it to break?

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,400
As you'd expect, it won't hold if
a large number of holes are opened at once.

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,490
For example, if a sea monster or Sea King
bites the ship, we're done for.

169
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,220
Look out, behind us!

170
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,010
A fight... We're saved.

171
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,440
If we crash into rocks or a trench and
the ship itself takes damage,

172
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,350
then fractures in the mast or hull
could cause the bubble to break.

173
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,500
So we have to avoid that too.

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,200
Basically, we have to look out for
sea creatures and other obstacles.

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,030
As long as we don't do anything stupid in here,
there's nothing to worry about.

176
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,570
I see!  It's stronger than I expected!

177
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,690
However, of all the ships that set off for Fishman Island...

178
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,490
70% are destroyed.  Be careful.

179
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,600
What's gonna happen to us?!

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,780
If I use my Gatling on them,
I'm sure I can catch all of those fish!

181
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,410
Then how about we compete
to see who can catch the most?

182
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,160
Weren't you listening to what Nami said?!

183
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,450
We can't open a bunch of holes!

184
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,620
I'm gonna beat the crap out of you two!
Never do that again!

185
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,920
Dammit!

186
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,330
Hachi said he'd lead us to Fishman Island,
so I didn't think it'd be this dangerous!

187
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,470
Oh, right!

188
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,910
I've got tons of lunch boxes.
And since Sanji's knocked out right now...

189
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,660
Everyone!  Let's have some food!

190
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,030
Yay!  My stomach's rumbling!

191
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,950
My bones are rumbling as well!

192
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,960
Nami, will the ship be safe?

193
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,250
Well, right now we're just riding a large ocean current, so...

194
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,680
See, there's something I need to tell all of you.

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,810
Your hidden robotic functions?!

196
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,080
No, sorry, but...

197
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,150
I am afraid that is incorrect, robo.

198
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,680
Whoa, awesome!  Robot-language!

199
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,790
The truth is, Hachi had planned to
come and guide us across the ocean floor...

200
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,400
but I heard he suffered major injuries on Sabaody,

201
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,600
and is now recovering on Fishman Island.

202
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
His reason is the same as Duval's.

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,060
He fought to protect the Thousand Sunny, which had been left behind on the island.

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,000
About a year ago, the Navy found out
where the Sunny was docked.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,080
In the fierce battle that followed,
both of them were forced to retire.

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,820
Huh?  Then how'd the ship last until now?

207
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,090
Because there was one more warrior.

208
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,220
The very same man who
scattered us 2 years ago, in fact.

209
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,980
A member of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea, and a great man, Bartholomew Kuma.

210
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,560
A few days ago, when I arrived at the Sunny,

211
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,610
I couldn't believe my eyes.

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,110
I was waiting for you.

213
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,810
Damn you!  What are you doing here?!

214
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,260
Mission complete.

215
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,990
The Sunny didn't have a single scratch on her.

216
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,330
And when I spoke to Rayleigh afterward...

217
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,800
I am an officer in the Revolutionary Army. {Copy-paste from 507}

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,340
Because of this,
I wish to let this crew escape. {End copy-paste from 507}

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,060
I'm guessing you figured it out too.

220
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,350
He saved our lives back then.

221
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,030
And after we vanished from the island, Kuma-san visited Rayleigh and said...

222
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,590
The time I have left... is running out. {Copy-paste from 507.}

223
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,490
I don't know what they were holding over him,

224
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,970
but he allowed the Navy to experiment on his body,
and they slowly turned him into a cyborg.

225
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,130
Shortly before the great war,

226
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,100
he agreed to undergo a modification that would remove his personality completely.

227
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:14,180
But there's no way he could've known what we'd do after we were scattered!

228
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,890
And yet he waited for us by the ship?  Even though he'd lost his personality?!

229
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,820
It seems that while he was with the surgeon, Doctor Vegapunk,

230
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,800
he got a promise that a certain mission would be programmed into him.

231
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,690
Guard the ship until
a member of the Straw Hat Pirates returns.

232
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,330
So, for two years he's been waiting for us.

233
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,170
Despite being a human weapon without memories, he's been obeying the orders from his past self.

234
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,980
His methods are completely messed up.

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,740
Why would he go that far for us?

236
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,540
He's with the Revolutionary Army.

237
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,820
The only explanation I can think of
is that Luffy's dad is their boss.

238
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,200
I don't really know much about my dad.

239
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,780
But I guess that bear-like guy was a good guy after all.

240
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,130
Kuma.

241
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,870
Well, the fact remains that...

242
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,840
he was the one who allowed us to
survive these 2 years and make them worthwhile.

243
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,060
Though by now, there's no way for us to ask him why he did what he did.

244
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,320
Just keep this fact stored in your hearts...

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,050
This crew is indebted to Bartholomew Kuma.

246
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,420
But even if we meet him again, Kuma has become nothing more than a heartless human weapon.

247
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,570
I'm grateful to him, but this raises a lot of questions.

248
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,220
I hope we'll be able to find out Kuma's true intentions one day.

249
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,990
That is all I have to say.

250
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,990
Oh, Sanji, you're awake?

251
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,780
Have a lunch box!  It's from the Island of Women!

252
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,000
The Island of Women...

253
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,840
Why should I be grateful to Kuma?

254
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,920
Do you have any idea where I've been for 2 years?!

255
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,670
What kind of training did you do on that all-women island of dreams, Luffy?!

256
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,340
Now, now, now, Sanji-san.
Shall we sing together?

257
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,850
Don't try to comfort me!
You're making me feel pathetic!

258
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,340
Bro!  There they are!

259
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,850
Ahead!  The Straw Hats!

260
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,410
I can see that, you dummy.

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,770
This time I'll get to board that ship, won't I?

262
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,150
I wonder how far we've sunk?

263
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,870
There isn't much light this far down.

264
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,930
We already passed through the sunlight level and
now we're nearing the end of the twilight level.

265
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,080
We must be more than
a kilometer down by now.

266
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,040
It's so quiet.
This feels completely different to the submarine.

267
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,590
It's almost like we're flying through the sky.

268
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,490
A whale!  It's a whale!

269
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,160
Laboon?  Laboon!

270
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,920
No, that's old man Whitebeard!

271
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,470
I see something at 6 o'clock!

272
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,210
A sea monster?  No...

273
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,570
Are you ready, you guys?

274
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,050
Yeah, Bro!

275
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,370
Aye!  Aye!

276
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,270
Our goal is right before our eyes!

277
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,650
We could destroy their ship,

278
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,390
and send the wreckage straight to the ocean floor.

279
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,560
But that's no good.
If we did that, no one would know who did it.

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,780
We'll take their heads
and bring them back to the surface.

281
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,400
That's how we'll sing out to the world,
"Caribou is here!"

282
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,460
Aye!

283
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,310
They'll be completely unprepared for a fight!

284
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,820
This is a perfect sneak attack!
Don't mess this up, you guys!

285
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,230
Aye!

286
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,300
Aye!  Aye!

287
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,130
Hey, you guys!

288
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,370
A shadow that looks like a ship is approaching from behind!

289
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,250
What?!

290
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,920
A ship?!

291
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,470
It's headed straight for us!

292
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,480
Charge!

293
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,780
It's a pirate ship!

294
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,670
They're ramming our ship!

295
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,070
Get away!  The bubble will break!

296
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,690
No way!  They're trying to break into our soap bubble!

297
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,810
Who are they?!

298
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,830
Good job, sea cow!

299
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,930
Aye!

300
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,170
Are they planning to board our ship?

301
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,270
Sea cow?

302
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,880
Wait! Isn't that...

303
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,860
Alright! Shall we get going?

304
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,080
Aye!

305
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Hey, Mohmoo! {Gil: Timing appeared one frame early. Hope I changed it correctly.} {Yup, it's good now -FAb}

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
You're Mohmoo from Arlong's crew, aren't you?

307
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,820
Do you recognize me?

308
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,930
Hey, Luffy!  Haven't we seen this guy before?

309
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,260
Really?

310
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,680
Die!

311
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,920
Rubber Pistol!

312
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,570
Let's board their ship, men!

313
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,280
Aye!

314
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,150
Someone's coming through!

315
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,660
Are you ready, men?!

316
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,920
Aye!

317
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,890
While these guys... stand there... dumbfounded...

318
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,430
every last one of 'em... will be slaughtered!

319
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,240
Let's go!

320
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,310
Aye!

321
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,710
Men!  Follow me!

322
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,340
Whaaaaaat?!

323
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,890
What's wrong, sea cow?!

324
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,250
Why are you doing this, sea cow?!

325
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,520
How can this be?!
Captain Caribou was left behind!

326
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,770
Bro?!

327
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Now... How about we give them a little greeting?

328
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,030
Fire the Gatling gun at 'em!

329
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:34,570
Kill every last member... of the Straw Hat Crew!

330
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,710
Don't!

331
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,680
P-Please, don't throw me into the ocean!

332
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
That's all I ask!

333
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,210
Anything but that!

334
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,030
You mustn't take another's life so casually!

335
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,320
God! { def: i'm going with consistency here and sticking with "God" (unless we get a confirmed plural translation).  it works with his crusaderish insignia as well. }

336
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,130
God is watching!

337
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,950
Right?!

338
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,230
Don't get cheeky with me!  Who was just talking about slaughter and Gatling guns?!

339
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,960
Who are you?

340
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,770
You're the captain of that pirate ship, aren't you?

341
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,970
Hm?!  Roronoa Zoro!

342
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,890
Oh, you're mistaken!  I'm not the captain!

343
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,540
I was, uh...

344
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,560
I was just being used as their slave!

345
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,050
Damn, I'm sick of being on that ship!

346
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,560
Oh, yeah!  Please!

347
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,050
Can you let me stay on your ship for a little while?

348
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,220
Please!  I'm begging you!

349
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,750
You know, I kinda feel sorry for him.

350
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,570
Oh, come on!  He's obviously lying!

351
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,900
What?!  It was all a lie?!

352
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,460
Hey, can I ask you something?

353
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,100
What was with the sea cow that was pulling the ship?

354
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,830
Oh...

355
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,600
What have we here?  Quite a cutie.

356
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,410
You're the Cat Burglar, aren't you?

357
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,280
Don't you dare look at our gorgeous navigator
with those vulgar eyes!

358
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,260
Nami-san, it's gonna be fine... now...

359
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,520
That's getting really annoying!

360
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,840
It's just a sea monster that we caught in these waters.

361
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,090
Using creatures like that to pull your ship is how professionals travel underwater.

362
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,470
Huh?!

363
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,270
So that's how it is!

364
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,960
Stop!  Stop, sea cow!

365
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,180
What happened, sea cow?!

366
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Bro!  I'm gonna save you!

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,550
I wonder if there are any sea monsters around?

368
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,880
Wait a second, Luffy.  What are you planning?

369
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,590
We'll start rehabilitating you with photos
since they don't have as much of an impact.

370
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,060
Hey, Nami.

371
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,500
Are we going in a different direction
from the one the Log Pose is pointing in? {zzz}

372
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
Yes, but don't worry.

373
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,870
We should move southwest of the compass needle.

374
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,620
But going directly toward the island would be faster!

375
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,650
Why?

376
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,280
Apparently, if you follow the needle directly,
you'll get caught up in the ocean currents,

377
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,750
and crash into an underwater mountain or volcano
before reaching your destination.

378
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,420
What?!  A volcano?!  The ocean floor is scary!

379
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,220
But I thought that all the currents of the Grand Line
are completely out of whack.

380
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,760
Is there really a current that isn't going to cause us problems?

381
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah, just one.

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,830
Everyone!  It's gonna get cold soon.  You'd better put on a coat.

383
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,980
True, my skin is starting to get goosebumps.

384
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,650
Ah!  Though I-

385
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,410
You're all bones, so you don't have skin, right?

386
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,260
We're going somewhere cold?
Aren't we headed for the ocean floor?

387
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,820
Of course the water at the ocean floor is cold.

388
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,400
Even in a bath, the water's warmer at the top
and colder on the bottom, right?

389
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,110
Oh, right.  So if it's the same for the sea,
the water down deep is colder than surface water.

390
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,130
Temperature isn't the only thing that's different...

391
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,120
Will you get over it already?!

392
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,600
In the deeper parts of the ocean,

393
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,890
there are giant currents known as "deep currents"
that you usually can't see.

394
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,940
They are completely different from
the surface currents we've been riding so far.

395
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,960
There are currents beneath the currents?

396
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
You sure are knowledgeable!

397
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,850
Only because I have lived for so long!

398
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,710
The currents all have to connect somewhere.

399
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,900
They flow from the east or the west
and then meet up...

400
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,020
Plunging downward and surging back up.

401
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,730
It's almost like an enormous dragon.

402
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,180
Apparently the deep currents flow very slowly.

403
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,810
They say that once water goes down to the ocean floor,

404
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:41,970
it can take 2,000 years
before it returns to a level that sees the sun.

405
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,580
2,000 years?!

406
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,200
Indeed.  Furthermore, there are countless legends...

407
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,810
about those dark, unknown sea currents.

408
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,960
Monsters, curses, and souls of the damned!

409
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,070
Whaaaaat?!  There are ghosts in the deep seas?!

410
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,320
Huh?!  There are?!  Scary!

411
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,630
How exciting!

412
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
Ghosts, huh?

413
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,360
I don't know about all that...

414
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,840
but we're gonna use the downflow to dive
from the surface currents to the deep currents.

415
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,940
By doing that, we'll be able to reach the ocean floor.

416
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,570
So it's a mysterious sea current.

417
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,200
You didn't understand any of that, did you?!

418
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,890
Shall we sing a song, Nami-san?

419
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,640
Nami, I see it!

420
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,660
Really?

421
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,560
The mysterious sea current?!

422
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,400
What's that?

423
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,630
The downflow, Plume!

424
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,880
Awesome!

425
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,020
This is almost like...

426
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,020
an enormous underwater waterfall!

427
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,000
That's so cool!
The water keeps falling all the way to the bottom!

428
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
It's unbelievably fast!

429
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,390
Very impressive, nature!

430
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,430
What a massive current!
I wonder how many hundred meters across it is?

431
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,100
Seeing it for yourself is completely different from
hearing stories about it!

432
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,310
I can't see the bottom!  It's pitch black down there!

433
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,120
It's all over!

434
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,950
If we fall at that speed,
we'll crash into the ocean floor.  We'll die!

435
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,360
Are you sure we'll be fine, riding this current?

436
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,470
Don't worry about the ship.

437
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,270
The Sunny was crafted from the Treasure Tree, Adam.
It's the strongest ship there is.

438
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,690
Alright!

439
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,150
Forward!

440
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,360
It can't be!

441
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,520
I hadn't heard that that thing was living down here!

442
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,070
The demon that races through the seas.

443
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,880
The enemy of all humanity!

444
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,710
Straw Hat Crew!  Turn around immediately!

445
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,460
We're doomed!

446
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,350
Oh yeah, you're here too.

447
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,040
There's a monster down there!

448
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,930
It's the Kraken!

449
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,590
The incomprehensibly gigantic monster octopus!

450
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,990
It's crushing several ships at once.

451
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,370
It has been preying on the ships that pass through here.

452
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,640
Please!  I don't wanna die!

453
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,460
Turn around!  If we just wait for a few days,
I'm sure that monster will-

454
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,480
Shut up!  Be quiet!

455
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,920
I just had a great idea!

456
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,680
Let's tame him!

457
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,160
Huh?

458
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,520
What are you talking about, Luffy?!

459
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
We'll tame that octopus and make him pull our ship!

460
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,830
Don't be ridiculous!

461
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,800
Look closely, or even if you don't look closely, can't you see how huge that thing is?!

462
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,200
Man, it sure is big...

463
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,300
I don't know how many centuries it's been alive,
but the Kraken appears in countless legends.

464
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,240
It's a mythical beast!
