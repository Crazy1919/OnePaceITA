1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,910
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,790
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,970
T-The Noah is...

10
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,060
The Noah isn't crashing into us anymore.

11
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,560
The Princess is luring the boat away for us!

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,520
Princess Shirahoshi!

13
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,200
Please make it out alive!

14
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,530
Where do you think you're going, Shirahoshi?

15
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,440
There's no place you can run!

16
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,370
Shirahoshi!

17
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,340
I have to make it out into the sea
and pull the Noah off the bubble!

18
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,070
It'll be awful if the bubble is damaged more than it has been already!

19
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,910
But it's too far to make it to the main gate.

20
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,080
Luffy-sama's friends must have been
the last people to leave Ryuuguu Palace...

21
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,450
so maybe they left the connecting channel open!

22
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,250
Damn it, isn't there anything we can do?!

23
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,190
The Princess is risking her life to save us!

24
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,000
It isn't the Princess' fault
that Decken has been stalking her!

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Decken's on board that boat.  And it's not just him...

26
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,470
Hody is also climbing aboard!

27
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,510
Princess Shirahoshi's life is in danger!

28
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,240
That insane backstabbing Decken.

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,150
But I've still got a use for him.

30
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,620
Watch out for Hody, Luffy.

31
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,460
In the water, humans are no match for fishmen.

32
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,670
I know!

33
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,670
It won't be any good if I break the outside bubble
and send him into the sea.

34
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,100
I've gotta get it just right.
It can't be too strong nor too weak.

35
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,970
Sanji!

36
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,000
This sure is a huge chain.

37
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,310
So this is between the two bubble layers.

38
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,900
Hody!

39
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,940
He's still below the first bubble.

40
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,120
Pull!  Pull!

41
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,990
We can't stop it, but maybe we can
slow it down a tiny bit for the Princess...

42
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,890
A tiny bit might be enough!

43
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,390
Pull!

44
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,560
Stop the Noah!

45
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,470
Princess!  Please use this chance to find a safe place!

46
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,680
Dammit!  Stop!

47
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,640
The merfolk!

48
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,180
Everyone...

49
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,410
Are you guys for real?!
There's no way it'll move a single inch!

50
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,610
Wasting your energy like that.

51
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,820
Hey!  Stop it!

52
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,730
You little pieces of filth.

53
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,840
Humans underestimate fishmankind because of cowards like you!

54
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,510
Everyone...

55
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,400
That bastard!

56
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,480
Princess... run away... quickly... please...

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
As I thought,

58
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,980
The entrance to Ryuuguu Palace was left open!

59
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,400
Don't die on me, now!

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,030
Damn you Hody!

61
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,400
Princess Shirahoshi!

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,190
She used the connecting channel to get into the sea!

63
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,920
The Noah's following her!

64
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,950
Princess!  Please keep going!

65
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,590
Whoa!  It's goin' up!

66
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
Wait up, chain!

67
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,970
You act all high and mighty on land...

68
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,910
but in the sea, you couldn't even put up a decent fight
against a fishman child!

69
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,850
This really is the limit of human strength.

70
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll make you regret ever opposing me.

71
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,730
Shirahoshi!

72
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,140
You enjoying your freedom?

73
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,230
The walls of Koukaku Tower kept you safe
for ten years, but they can't help you here.

74
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,360
Will you die from blood loss?

75
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,300
Or will you be smashed by this behemoth first?

76
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,580
I'll give you one last chance, Shirahoshi.

77
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,510
Say yes, and I'll spare your life.  It's still not too late!

78
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,630
I'm terribly sorry, Decken-sama, but...

79
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,880
Marry me!

80
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
...you're just not my-

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,270
Well then, die!

82
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,390
You think we'd let you marry her?

83
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:15,010
We won't let you put a single finger on our only sister, Decken!

84
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,020
My dearest brothers,
Manboshi-sama and Ryuuboshi-sama!  And Hoe-sama!{ def: double check for three lines in workraw-sd }

85
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,300
Wha?!  Our brothers?!

86
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,680
We're not your brothers!

87
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,040
Dearest brothers, everyone in the plaza tried to...

88
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,410
Shirahoshi!  Save the crying for later!

89
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,970
My dearest brothers are angry?

90
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,160
We're not angry!

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,580
Father said that the Noah is an important ship,
so we can't allow it to get a single scratch -la-ti-do!

92
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,840
That means we have to return it
to the sea floor without damaging it!

93
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,580
Here it comes!

94
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,620
Damn it!  In any case, we can't swim near the underwater mountains or ravines.

95
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,410
That would damage the Noah!

96
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,710
So where should I escape to, dearest Manboshi?

97
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,520
Up!  There are too many obstacles on the sea floor!

98
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,620
I understand!

99
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,650
We'll get Decken.

100
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:36,050
From the Noah... and my endless love...
you will never be able to escape, Shirahoshi!

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,500
Hey, thanks!  You saved me!

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,730
Does the wound that you got from Hody
still bother you?

103
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,430
I won't let you get away, Straw Hat!

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't have time to worry about a wound like this!

105
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,800
You may be a member of the merman race, who pride themselves on being the world's fastest swimmers...

106
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,360
but compared to me, it's like you're not even moving.

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,290
That guy.

108
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,030
{\an8}Shark cutter

109
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,490
Hey, get me onto the ship's deck!

110
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,890
It's like Jinbe said...

111
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,660
Do you think there's water inside the ship, Jinbe? { from 558 }

112
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,230
I'm not sure, but Decken is a Devil Fruit user...

113
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,440
so we can assume that there must be air in there somewhere since he can make the ship move. { end 558 }

114
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,100
So it should be easier to fight in there.

115
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,550
I want to defeat both Hody and
that guy who keeps throwing things.

116
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,030
I promised Weak-hoshi that I would protect her
when I took her out of the tower.

117
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,710
A promise, you say...

118
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,320
We'll become great soldiers like our father. {21:07.03 in ep 546}

119
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,050
Just as we promised,
we'll protect Shirahoshi with our lives! { end 546 }

120
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,670
We've made a promise too.

121
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,920
His strength is nothing more than a mockery, borrowed from the Energy Steroids.

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,260
It's pitiful to think that
I couldn't stand up to that rogue.

123
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,100
Forgive us for doubting you earlier.

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,520
Don't worry about it.  Just get me onto the deck!

125
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,400
Is there something you want on the deck?

126
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,690
Hody!

127
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,100
Up, up...

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,900
Oh, Hody Jones.

129
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,510
How's Neptune?  Did you kill him?

130
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm just in the middle
of tormenting Shirahoshi with the Noah.

131
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,480
Wasn't this a great idea?

132
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,680
Don't you think so, Brother?

133
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,620
I also have a good idea.

134
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,280
What is it?  Will you tell me?

135
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,980
If you die...

136
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,810
...what will happen to this boat?

137
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,230
Decken.

138
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,970
Hody... You little brat...

139
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,660
I just touched you... with my left hand!

140
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,200
Now, tell me what the hell you think you're doing!

141
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,830
You betrayed me first, Decken.

142
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:31,760
Honestly, I panicked for a second
when this ship blocked the sky above the island. { def: it really isn't sky... but it really isn't an island either }

143
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,440
Breaking the island's bubble is a good idea, though.

144
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,240
True, Fishman Island will crumble with it, but the Fishman District will remain!

145
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,210
If you die here and now,
your Mato Mato powers will stop working...

146
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,320
and the ship will plunge straight down toward Fishman Island once more.

147
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,200
It will annihilate everything.

148
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,830
Right now, my top priority
is destroying those pesky Straw Hat Pirates.

149
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,250
Tens of thousands of my own men may die as well...

150
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,630
Oh well, I can always get more human slaves later.

151
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,180
You want everyone to die?

152
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,410
That sounds good...

153
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,480
but you'll be first!

154
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,770
Die!

155
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,240
No, you idiot! { def: calling the axe an idiot doesn't work in english.  the manga has "You can't be serious!" } {Swashy-B: Followed deffy. Changed from "Idiot! Stop right there!"}

156
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,900
Now you're nothing but a historical footnote for the new Fishman Island. { def: Now you're nothing but a historical footnote for the new Fishman Island. } {Swashy-B: Changed from, "Become a founding pillar for the new Fishman Island."}

157
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,720
You'll die before long. { def: btw, the animation for this sequence made the Mato Mato power look stupidly weak.  Hody should have at least been dodging }

158
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,680
Then the ship will resume its descent, and fall upon Fishman Island!

159
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm a kind man.  Before your life comes to an end,

160
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,570
I will fulfill your lifelong wish.

161
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,740
I will kill Shirahoshi!

162
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,610
He killed Decken!
What's going on between those two?!

163
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,050
We can't worry about that now.  He's coming!

164
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,420
We will stop him!

165
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,540
You're in my way!

166
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
You worthless beings!

167
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,080
My dear brothers! { def: what's the "mata" here?  can we make it a "no"? }

168
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,160
Shirahoshi!  Run away, as fast as you can!

169
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,370
Eliminating you will be a simple matter
now that you're outside Koukaku Tower!

170
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,310
Even the merfolk's underwater speed, said to be fastest in the world, is useless against me now! { def: underwater speed } {Swashy-B: Agreed. Gonna make the change from 'famous speed'.}

171
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,990
My dear brothers!

172
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,660
Luffy-sama!  Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

173
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,470
Straw Hat!

174
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,080
Brother!

175
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,670
Forgive me!  I was unavoidably delayed while I made some preparations!

176
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,210
Y-You damn scum!

177
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,890
Meanwhile, in Gyoncord Plaza on Fishman Island.

178
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,600
Cap'n Vander Decken abandoned me!

179
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,820
You will become a sacrifice for the death
of Shirahoshi, just like the rest of Fishman Island! {Copy-paste from 558.}

180
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,280
Hey Umibouzu, start fighting!

181
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,200
We're counting on you!
Do something about the Kraken!

182
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,410
Go get him, Kraken!

183
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
You can win!

184
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,270
They're both gigantic,
but one of them doesn't have any will to fight.

185
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,750
The Kraken will win for sure!

186
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,400
Hey, Great Monk!  You must have heard him wrong.

187
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,760
What Decken actually said was...

188
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,680
"I leave this plaza to you!"

189
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,310
Meaning that he never planned to destroy the island.

190
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,690
But... he told me that I was a sacrifice.

191
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,220
He meant that you should fight whole heartedly and lay down your life if necessary.

192
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,030
Really?

193
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,650
Isn't that right, guys?

194
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,140
Huh?  Uh...

195
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,670
Yeah, that's right!

196
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,450
It's rare for a captain to have this much faith
in one of his underlings! {Literally "An underling whom the captain has this much faith in isn't anywhere!"}

197
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,420
You're the hero! { def: this doesn't seem right } {Swashy-B: I concur. It doesn't make sense in context with the next line. Not sure what to change that to.}

198
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,120
It's time to show what you're made of!

199
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,830
Oh, so dat's it?

200
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,150
No, not really.

201
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,390
Now, swallow this...

202
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,840
and fight as our ally.  Crush the Straw Hat Pirates!

203
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,380
An Energy Steroid!

204
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,520
No way... That'll never work on someone so huge.

205
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,800
It was super effective on him! { def: It was super effective on him! } {Swashy-B: Changed as per def's suggestion from, "He's one of those people whom drugs work instantly on!"}

206
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,030
Surume!

207
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,490
Cap'n Decken!  Sorry I doubted ya! {Swashy-B: Changed "ah" to "I". I just think its overkill.}

208
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,240
Alright!  He knocked the Kraken out!

209
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,510
What's wrong?!  Hang in there!

210
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,160
It's no use!  He's unconscious!

211
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,620
Yer enemies too, right?! {Swashy-B: Keeping consistent, "Yer" instead of "You're".}

212
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,380
He's like a completely different person!

213
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,550
Leave dis to me!

214
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,590
Where's da enemy?! {Swashy-B: the "Where'th" is a bit overkill in my opinion so I removed it. The "da" is enough.}

215
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,010
I-It's him, Wadatsumi!

216
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,560
Dat guy, huh?

217
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,550
Yer mine!

218
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,820
Jinbe-chan, watch out!

219
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,630
{\an8}Seven Thousand Tile Roundhouse Kick

220
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,580
Ow, ow, ow, owie!

221
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,420
How can someone that small
block his attack?! {Swashy-B: How bout "that small" instead of "so much smaller"? I think it sounds better and concise.}

222
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,300
Nami-san!  How could this happen?!

223
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,930
Nami-san got hit by the shockwave!

224
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,830
Get up, damn you!

225
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,380
Owie!  Who is it now?!

226
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,340
Hey fatty!  If you gave our beautiful navigator
so much as a single scratch... {Swashy-B: "Hey fatty!" or "You big oaf!" "Galoot" just sounds like he's a country bumpkin.}

227
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,280
you're gonna pay!

228
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,830
No way!  His kicks hurt him too!

229
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,930
Wadatsumi is a monster the size of an underwater mountain.

230
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,200
How strong are his legs?!

231
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,870
Aww...

232
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,650
Now I'm all dirty... {NO YOU ARE NOT. IN FACT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A SPECK OF DUST ON YOU AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. AND WHY THE HELL IS THIS THE BEST ANIMATED PART OF THE EPISODE. GODDAMMIT TOEI WILL YOU STOP TREATING THE FEMALE CHARACTERS LIKE A PAIR OF BREASTS THAT JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A WOMAN ATTACHED TO THEM ALREADY?!!!!!!!!!!!! ...Yeah, I'm not particularly fond of blatant fanservice-shots, by the way.}

233
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,450
Don't blame me for dat...

234
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,890
We will fight you, Great Monk!

235
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,380
{\an8}Manjuu: A Japanese confection

236
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,360
Apologize with your life, you Jumbo Manjuu!

237
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,780
What is with these guys?!

238
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,630
Stop it!

239
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,120
Hyouzou-san!  We're on your-

240
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,060
There's something strange about him.

241
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,020
He's even worse than when he's drunk! {Swashy-B: Changed from "He's even worse than he usually is drunk!" Just needed to be reworded.}

242
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,980
His strength has multiplied!

243
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,400
{\an8}Drunken Staggering Hash

244
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,790
E-Even steel shields can't stop him!

245
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,460
Wasn't he writhing in pain just a minute ago? Yet no one had harmed him...

246
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,960
No way... This is just like Hody-san's transformation!

247
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,810
Has Hyouzou-san turned into a monster too?!

248
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,100
This feels great!  My power's overflowing!

249
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,480
Man, I wanna cut down more people!

250
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,690
Let me cut you!

251
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,220
Run!  Somebody stop him!

252
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,650
There's no way to block his attacks!

253
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,970
Anyone will do!

254
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,340
Found one!

255
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,420
Hy-Hyouzou-san was stopped!

256
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,760
Zoro!

257
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,270
Sorry, but I'll be taking on this guy!

258
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,770
He might be a good warm-up before I enter the New World!

259
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,150
My power really does drop in the ocean... { def: i'm not a fan of these next five lines.  i'll recheck them after tlc }

260
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,940
Your power dropped?! {Swashy-B: Changed from "power's"}

261
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,380
Inferior trash!

262
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,900
Do you realize where we are?!

263
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,690
We're in the deep sea!  A mere human doesn't even have a one to ten thousand chance of winning!

264
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,660
Besides, everything will be over soon.

265
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,830
Shirahoshi, Fishman Island, and your companions...

266
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,060
A weakling like you can't protect any of them!

267
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,210
You're wrong.

268
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,980
I'll protect them all!

269
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,730
That's what the last two years were for!
