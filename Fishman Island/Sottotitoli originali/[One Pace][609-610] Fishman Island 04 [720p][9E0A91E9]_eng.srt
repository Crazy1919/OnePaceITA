00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,340
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,640
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,380
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,870
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,320
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,820
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,490
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,070
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,720
We... made it this far.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,620
We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,720
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610
The sun in my heart will never set!

One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,030
We Go!

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,310
Rejoice!

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,620
I...

47
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,650
will...

48
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,860
live here!

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,630
Sanji-chan, you're so funny!

50
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,350
Looks like he's back to his old self now that he's here.

51
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,360
Is it pure willpower?

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,420
You guys are so lucky, being able to swim and all.

53
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,170
Luffy-chin, you can swim too if you use a bubble.

54
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,970
Really?!

55
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,600
Anyway, I'm relieved.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,310
If he gets another nosebleed, I won't
be able to treat him since I'm out of blood bags.

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,180
Sanji has a rare blood type, after all.

58
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,550
Hey, Caimie...

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,890
There's someone here on Fishman Island
I really want to meet!

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,810
Who is it?  The Mermaid Princess?

61
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,420
Nope!

62
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,880
It's Jinbe!

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,860
Boss Jinbe?

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,420
W-Wait, Luffy, when you say Jinbe...
You didn't befriend another Warlord, did you?!

65
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,380
Oh, wait, he quit during the war,
so I guess he's an ex-Warlord now.

66
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,100
Yup!  He's my friend!

67
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,030
{\an8}W-What is it with you?!

68
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,570
Fishman Island "Ryuuguu Kingdom"

69
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,610
{\an8}After Ace died two years ago...

70
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,180
{\an8}the only reason I got back on my feet
was because he helped me!

71
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,850
I really wanna meet Jinbe!

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,790
Let us meet again in two years, at Fishman Island! {From 516 this line and the following originate.}

73
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,430
I am looking forward to the day when you and your crew arrive! {And thus ends the portion repeated from 516.}

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,070
I promised I'd meet him on this island!

75
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,070
Now that you mention it,
I read an article that said you were with Boss Jinbe.

76
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,050
Where is Jinbe?

77
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,640
Uh... Well, he isn't on the island.

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Huh?

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,820
You know how he resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea during the war two years ago?

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,320
Because of that, the former members of the
Fishman Pirates couldn't stay on this island anymore.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,740
So they all left, together with Boss Jinbe.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,130
Huh?!  So does that mean I can't see him?

83
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,680
It's a long story, but basically the war had a great impact on this island too.

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,320
Caimie!

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,350
A ship is coming!

86
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,110
It might be coming!

87
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,420
A royal ship is coming!

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,910
Maybe nobody's on it!

89
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,510
Of course there's somebody on it!

90
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,350
Who's onboard the ship, Killifish-chins?

91
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,380
We don't know yet.

92
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,450
The royal ship, such a rare sight!

93
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,460
A ship that hardly ever comes here!

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,340
Maybe they're here to arrest Luffy-chin and the others, since they're illegal immigrants?

95
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,290
So what if they are?

96
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,460
You all have to hide, Luffy-chin!

97
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,370
Is that the royal family's gondola?

98
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,300
Is it really?

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,790
It is!

100
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,390
Isn't it?

101
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,180
It is, isn't it?

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,840
So what if it is?

103
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,760
But it can't actually be
someone from the royal family, can it?

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,910
They wouldn't come all the way
out to this corner of the island themselves.

105
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,130
The three Neptune Brothers have arrived!

106
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,500
{\an8}Greetings, women of the cove.

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,000
Ryuuguu Kingdom
The Three Brothers of the Neptune Family

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
{\an8}There is something I would like to ask.

109
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,870
It's the princes!

110
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,930
What are they doing here?!

111
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,470
Princes?

112
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,930
No, Sanji-chan!

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,680
A-Alright.

114
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,250
You have to stay hidden.

115
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,680
Hey, what's...

116
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,680
{\an8}We have received word of some illegal immigrants.

117
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,610
First son - Fukaboshi
(Shark Merman)

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,710
{\an8}Did they come this way?

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,460
{\an8}If they did, then please say so-la-ti-do!

120
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,310
Second son - Ryuboshi
(Oarfish Merman)

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,590
{\an8}If they didn't, then that's alright too-mi-re-do!

122
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,610
{\an8}Akkamanbo!  Yay!  Yay!

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,430
Third son - Manboshi
(Opah Merman)

124
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,440
{\an8}I wanna have some fun here too!

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,890
Nobody has come this way.

126
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,880
Are they really so important?

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,370
I mean, for you princes to come all the way out here...

128
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,650
Well, we haven't yet confirmed whether or not
they are who I think they are.

129
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,790
We haven't confirmed it-mi-re-do!

130
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,310
Everyone!  Let's dance together!

131
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,080
What's all the commotion about?

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,810
Hey, those are the princes from the Neptune Army!

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,270
What are they doing here?

134
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,270
This is a problem.

135
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,400
I see.  Thank you for your assistance.

136
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,840
We will look elsewhere.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,580
Forgive us for disturbing you while you were having such a good time.

138
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,350
Let's have another dance sometime!

139
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,690
Sorry for disturbing you-fa-mi-re-do!

140
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,580
Not at all!

141
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,390
Did the border police make a mistake?

142
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,180
Sanji!

143
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,600
Sanji-chan!

144
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,370
All that blood... Sanji's in trouble!

145
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,270
It didn't work!
All the excitement he was holding in erupted!

146
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,610
That's...

147
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,510
No doubt about it.  That's the pirate Straw Hat Luffy.

148
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,230
Ammo Knights!

149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,910
Yes, Sir!

150
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,170
Whaddayaknow, Straw Hat and his group are here.

151
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,750
What are we gonna do?
The army will get them before us!

152
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,090
But it's a bad idea to fight the Neptune Army here.

153
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,900
Please, wait!

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,060
We're sorry about entering the country illegally!

155
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,320
But if you're gonna arrest us, please do it later!

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,600
Is there anyone here willing to donate their blood?!

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,040
Without help, our companion will be dead within an hour!

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,510
He has blood type S, RH-.

159
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,520
It's not very common,
but is there anyone here with that type?!

160
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,850
Or do mermen and fishmen have different blood from humans?

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,020
Chopper-chin...

162
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,730
Hurry!  Isn't there anyone?!

163
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,530
You can't... You can't die such a ridiculous death!

164
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,100
Please, anyone!  I'm begging you!

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,530
Give Sanji blood!

166
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,170
Luffy-chin, Chopper-chin!

167
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,580
Both mermen and fishmen have
the same blood types as humans.

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,810
It's possible to do a blood transfusion.

169
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,660
But...

170
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,610
These humans are spouting nonsense!

171
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,090
It's the guys with the sea monsters!

172
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,290
Prince Fukaboshi,
it's Hammond of the Fishman District.

173
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,190
Give our blood to an inferior species like you humans?

174
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,920
Nobody on Fishman Island would be so obliging!

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,510
And even if you found someone...

176
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,010
the human-haters on this island would
subject them to the Judgment of the Dark Night!

177
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,750
That kid can just lie there and bleed to death.
He's completely beyond help!

178
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,350
There is an old law in this country...

179
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,390
"You shall not share your blood with humans."

180
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,960
What?!

181
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,460
Make no mistake!
This law was created by you humans.

182
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,100
During our long history together,
you humans have always feared us as monsters!

183
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,670
You were the ones
who forbade the mixing of our blood!

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,480
That is what caused the death of
Fishman Island's hero, Fisher Tiger.

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,190
The man who put his life on the line to
free all slaves, regardless of their species.

186
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,000
He died after a bloody battle, even though he could have easily been saved by a blood transfusion!

187
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,960
The heartless humans refused to give him blood...

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,260
so he died!

189
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,400
Disregard the life of that one underling of yours, and come with us to the Fishman District!

190
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,170
The captain of the New Fishman Pirates, Hody Jones-sama, wants to see you!

191
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,310
Hey, I don't know anything about your rules, but please,

192
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,850
isn't there anyone here with the blood type S, RH-?!

193
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,150
We don't care what we have to do in return!

194
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,090
For now, please just save his life!

195
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,860
Camie!

196
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,560
If you're not gonna come willingly...

197
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,060
We'll just have to bring you along by force!

198
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,100
Trawl Net!

199
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,400
I thought I already told you...

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,430
I won't...

201
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,850
do what you say!

202
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,530
Jet Pistol!

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,960
Luffy!  There's a sea monster behind you!

204
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,920
Hammond and his gang from the Fishman District...

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
The sea monster...

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,820
admitted defeat without even fighting?!

207
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,000
Amazing!

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,330
What was that?  Luffy-chan is amazing!

209
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,820
I would expect no less.

210
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,370
Luffy-chin!

211
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,000
Bring Sanji-chin aboard!

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,410
Let's go to the city!

213
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,220
There are plenty of humans at the port in the city!

214
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,910
Hurry!

215
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,080
You there, wait!
The Ryuuguu belongs to the princes!

216
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,220
I'm sorry!  I promise to give it back after we've saved Sanji-chin!

217
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,350
Right, we're aboard! Caimie, let's go!

218
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,840
Please Ryuuguu-chin! Take us to the city!

219
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,710
I'm so sorry.

220
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,410
If only I had the same blood type, I would gladly help.

221
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,330
You have nothing to apologize for.

222
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,350
It's his fault for having
perverted thoughts in the first place.

223
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,520
Just look!  He's still grinning.

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,280
Sanji!  Just stop it, already!

225
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,290
Don't imagine anything at all!
We don't have a second to spare!

226
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,430
Still, this reminds me of the discrimination that
you and Hachi suffered on Sabaody two years ago.

227
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,500
It looks like the problem runs deep.

228
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,390
I never thought a nosebleed could become something serious like this.

229
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,900
Yeah... Even if we get to the city,
I'm still a bit worried.

230
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,140
Will we find someone willing to donate blood on time?

231
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,350
In the past month,
no humans have come to the island at all.

232
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,980
You are the first guests we've had in a while.

233
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,860
Why?  Isn't this a famous tourist spot?

234
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,390
Yeah, it is, but...

235
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,290
We don't know for sure, but there's a rumor that something is interfering with travelers' voyages.

236
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,400
That there's some shadowy force behind all of this... People all over the country are talking about it.

237
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,500
This is quite inconvenient, you know.

238
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,320
Why were you hiding the pirates from us?

239
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,280
We're so sorry, Prince Fukaboshi!

240
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,010
Caimie said they were her friends.

241
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,350
They weren't bad people, so we didn't want them to be arrested as illegal immigrants.

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,390
Will Sanji-chan really be alright?

243
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,860
You're jumping to conclusions.  They are famous pirates.

244
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,310
It doesn't matter how they entered the country.

245
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,660
We were already perfectly aware who they are.

246
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,080
We were looking for them
for a different reason-re-mi-fa!

247
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,740
Really?

248
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,090
I didn't get a chance to give them...

249
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,720
Jinbe's message.

250
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,930
Ryuuguu Kingdom, Port Town 
 "Coral Hill"

251
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,820
Sanji!  Are you awake?

252
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,530
Sanji-chin!

253
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
Where am I?

254
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,430
Thank goodness!

255
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,690
We're in the house of one of my friends from the port town.

256
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,140
Sanji-chin, you'd lost
most of the blood in your body!

257
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,210
I'm so glad we were able to find
a donor with the same blood type!

258
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,850
I see... My blood, huh?

259
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,890
What happened to me?

260
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,690
You mustn't get up so suddenly!  Stay in bed.

261
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,650
But really, why did the fishmen refuse to give him blood?

262
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,570
We ran all over town,
but we couldn't find any humans!

263
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,250
I honestly thought it was hopeless!

264
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,470
Thanks for helping me, you guys.

265
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,680
But... I can't remember a thing.

266
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,910
Where was I, and what was I doing?

267
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,350
Don't recall it! { def: is the initial "ha!" part of the phrase or just a shout? } {Gil: Sounds just like a shout to me. Retimed line to not include the shout.}

268
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,550
If you get another nosebleed, you'll be beyond saving!

269
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,730
Oh, right!  Sanji, let me introduce
the blood donors we met at the bar!

270
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,370
You mean I was given blood by... a delicate lady?

271
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,040
It's quite alright...

272
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,040
We humans need to help each other out in times of need.

273
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,030
{\an8}It's alright, silly.

274
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,850
Pirate Twins 
 Splash and Splatter

275
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,850
{\an8}If you like, we'll gladly give you more, silly.

276
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,530
I'm glad you've recovered.

277
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,900
Come on, thank them already.

278
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,230
Luffy.  Let me see your right arm for a second.

279
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,140
A poison reaction...

280
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,520
That wound is poisoned.

281
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,200
Oh yeah, while I was fighting the fishmen earlier...

282
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,550
I did feel a slight sting.

283
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,590
And you're completely fine?!

284
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,360
This poison is lethal!

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,230
That's amazing!

286
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,940
Luffy's body must have developed antitoxins, and repelled the poison without us noticing!

287
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,020
Have you been exposed to
large amounts of poison before?

288
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,430
Poison, huh...

289
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,380
I was almost killed by poison back in Impel Down.

290
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,490
Almost killed?
Is that really something to laugh about?!

291
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,680
It must have been that guy...

292
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,290
The swordsman with the octopus-legs.

293
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,830
He withstood my attack, after all.

294
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,350
He was pretty tough.

295
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,540
That came from the cove.

296
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,110
Those mermaids sure are noisy.

297
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,480
Now then, what should I do?

298
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
These guys are both out cold.

299
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,400
{\an8}And I carelessly ended up poisoning Straw Hat.

300
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,870
Assassin of the New Fishman Pirates
Hyouzou (Blue-Ringed Octopus Merman)

301
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,260
{\an8}It'd be real bad if he died.

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,390
That scream was from Ishilly and the others, right?

303
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,220
Ishilly!

304
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,400
Ishilly!

305
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,530
I'm sure I heard them over here.

306
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,270
Where could they have gone?

307
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,810
Earlier, I heard them talking about opening a barrel.

308
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,740
The manager of the Mermaid Café.  She let us borrow the room.

309
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,110
What's this?!

310
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,790
This is Madame Shyarly.

311
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,150
Really?  Thanks!

312
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,940
{\an8}Is the blond boy alright now?

313
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,860
Owner of the Mermaid Cafe
Madame Shyarly

314
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,970
{\an8}Yeah.

315
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,860
{\an8}But Madame, since you're so beautiful,

316
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,760
you should stay out of his room for now.

317
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,010
Also, the fact that we're in the back rooms
of the Mermaid Café...

318
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,020
Keep it a secret from Sanji-chin.

319
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,310
Why?

320
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,200
Because if he finds out...

321
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,100
he'll be in trouble again,
or so his doctor, Chopper-chin, says.

322
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,320
That's an odd prescription.

323
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,010
Hey!  Huge mermaid!

324
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,650
Her name is Madame Shyarly, Luffy-chin!

325
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,930
What's this?

326
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,350
It's so pretty!

327
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,510
Don't touch that, Straw Hat Boy.

328
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,140
Huh?

329
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,840
That's a crystal ball.  It's used for fortune-telling.

330
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,980
Madame is famous for
making predictions here on Coral Hill.

331
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,370
I've quit fortune-telling.

332
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,170
It's better not to know the future.

333
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,430
So, do mermaids poop?

334
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,240
Whaddaya mean, "so"?!
That has nothing to do with fortune-telling!

335
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,580
You vulgar boy!

336
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,690
Apologize to her, Luffy-chin!

337
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,730
Sorry!

338
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,500
Caimie...

339
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,900
Feel free to take the day off.

340
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
Give your friends a tour of the island.

341
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,940
Are you sure?

342
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,950
You've been working really hard, after all.

343
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,860
Besides...

344
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,380
Lately, we haven't gotten a single human pirate customer.

345
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,800
This will be good for business.

346
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,470
The girls from the cove will be coming here soon, so we've got more than enough staff.

347
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,990
Oh, that reminds me!

348
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,080
I have to hurry and give Pappagg his clams!

349
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,080
That's one weird way to realize that.

350
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,920
He must be starving.

351
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
What?

352
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,160
If you mean Monsieur Pappagg, he met an old friend of his.

353
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,990
The two of them are hanging out in the café right now.

354
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,250
I didn't mention this earlier but...

355
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,290
Back when the Madame was still a child,

356
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,720
she said that lots of pirates
would be coming to the island soon...

357
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,710
And then the Great Age of Pirates began the following year.

358
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,610
What?!

359
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,100
It'd take way too long if I told you all the details,

360
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,530
but a while back she also predicted
the war at Marineford and the death of Whitebeard.

361
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,070
Since she's predicted so many bad things, it sounds like she's gotten tired of it.

362
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,760
That's scary!

363
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,260
Wait, where's Chopper?

364
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,170
He's looking after Sanji.

365
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,060
Luffy-chin, Usopp-chin!

366
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,310
Coming!

367
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,200
This is the main street on Coral Hill.

368
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,700
Look!  This is the entrance to the Mermaid Café!

369
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,880
Man, I sure am hungry!

370
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,510
It's just a café!

371
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,180
We have food here too.

372
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,080
Like cake and fruits of the sea!

373
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,380
How about meat?

374
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,260
Merfolk don't eat meat or fish, so...

375
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,360
the menu consists of Seaweed Brûlée, Algae Tart, Kelp Soufflé...

376
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,600
Is any of that good?

377
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,440
But we do have meat too!

378
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,550
Really?!

379
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,160
Shellfish meat, Scallop Sandwich, Freshwater Clam Pizza-

380
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,310
Shellfish meat doesn't count!  Don't insult meat like that!

381
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,640
Anyway, let's get going.  To the Mermaid Café.

382
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,040
Yeah.  Pappagg's waiting for us.

383
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,310
I mean it!  Don't look down on meat!

384
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,280
Thank you very much!

385
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,810
Brook!

386
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,060
Brook-chin!

387
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,630
Oh?  Why, if it isn't Luffy-san!

388
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,510
And Caimie-san, it has been far too long!

389
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,400
Straw!  Nose!

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,450
I've really missed you guys!

391
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,130
So you're finally here?

392
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,130
So you were with Pappagg?

393
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,160
Please come again, Soul King!

394
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,730
It feels like we've been living a dream!

395
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,390
I'm definitely comin' back, beautiful mermaids!

396
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,560
What?

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,750
I need to loosen my bones a little.

398
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,670
Ah!  But if I were to loosen my bones, I'd die!

399
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,070
I wouldn't mind dying right now!  Though I already am dead.

400
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,460
Amazing!

401
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,410
They've just been in a café,
yet the tension is already this high?

402
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,740
You're right!  What's it like in there?

403
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,540
Now, wait just a minute!

404
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,710
It's not like you're leaving today, is it?

405
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,550
I understand why you're interested,
but later you can all go to the Mermaid Café together.

406
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,800
I was just about to take Bones on a tour of my mansion!

407
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,620
Follow me!  Do you like the meat of sea beasts?

408
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,800
You have meat?!

409
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,010
You think a wild man such as myself
would be satisfied with seashells and seaweed?

410
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,460
My diet consists of
the meat of the very fiercest sea beasts!

411
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,430
Oh, Pappagg, I forgot!

412
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,150
Here are your clams for today.

413
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,530
Yay!  Caimie's delicious clams!

414
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,170
Hey, aren't those just shellfish?!

415
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,530
Merfolk don't eat meat and fish, but fishmen do.

416
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,740
So it's not like there isn't any of it on this island.

417
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,280
Really?  That's a relief!

418
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,570
Hey, taxi!

419
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,930
Vander Decken?!

420
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,940
Why is a ghost on the wanted list?

421
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,360
The guy from the ghost ship we met on the way here?

422
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,900
Huh?  You met him?!

423
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,680
He's some kind of undersea robber who
the country has been hunting down for ages.

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,260
But let's talk about that later.  For now, get onboard!

425
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,860
Vander Decken used to send a love letter to the Mermaid Princess of Ryuuguu Kingdom every week.

426
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,800
Eventually he went from letters to packages,
 and then threats and demands for her to marry him.

427
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
This is so fluffy!  It feels so nice!

428
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,900
This truly feels like paradise!

429
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,130
Listen to what I'm saying!

430
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,200
Sure!

431
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,100
Oh, excuse me.

432
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,110
The princess was terrified...

433
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,750
and the country could no longer ignore it, so...

434
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,870
Indeed!  The princess' father, King Neptune, got upset,

435
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,590
and the three princes you met earlier mobilized the army to chase after him,

436
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,590
but they couldn't find him.

437
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,350
Caimie... Caimie... I was just about to explain that.

438
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,870
So basically, King Neptune the Sea God,
who rules this country,

439
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,940
has four children including the Mermaid Princess.

440
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,810
The Mermaid Princess is the youngest, and her
big brothers are the three princes you met earlier.

441
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,530
Uh, but something bothers me.

442
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:28,030
Isn't Vander Decken that cursed pirate from several hundred years ago?

443
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,240
Oh!

444
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,040
Well, legends are often
exaggerations of exaggerations.

445
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,700
It seems that he did exist,

446
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:45,420
but the Vander Decken from the legend was just a man who reached this island and lived in the country.

447
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,220
So, the ship you encountered
was probably the real Flying Dutchman...

448
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,670
but the captain was just his descendant!

449
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,530
Va-

450
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,610
Vander Decken the ninth!

451
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,630
{\an8}What?!  His descendant?!

452
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,070
Fish Taxi

453
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,540
{\an8}Oh, that's how it is?  So he wasn't a ghost after all.

454
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,670
Being only bones, and thinking I had met a real ghost, I was starting to feel more dead than alive.

455
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,740
Thank goodness.
If nothing else, I am truly happy about that.

456
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,580
Caimie... Caimie... Caimie...

457
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,430
Oh!  Now that I look closely, there are
so many different kinds of merfolk and fishmen!

458
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,410
There are old lady mermaids down there too!
They're just like old Kokoro!

459
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,010
Look over there!  Those are babies!

460
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,450
Their father is a fishman,
but his kids are both merfolk and fishmen.

461
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,520
Basically, if a fishman and a mermaid get married, they can have sons and daughters of either race.

462
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
In other words, there are four possible outcomes.

463
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,230
So that's why there are so many different types!

464
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,190
That's cool!

465
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,700
We're getting on the high-speed current now.

466
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,640
This is so fast!

467
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,920
Huh?  What's that?

468
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,210
Ah, that's the candy factory.

469
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,080
That's not what I meant.
Why is there a pirate-flag on it?

470
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,140
Oh, that?  There's one at the bay
and at the entrance to the island too.

471
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,820
Fishman Island is currently
under the protection of that pirate flag.

472
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,060
It's the mark of the New World pirate
Charlotte Linlin.

473
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,690
Also known as Big Mom.  One of the Four Emperors!

474
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,500
Before the war, this island was protected from pirates by Whitebeard's name.

475
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,820
Now, Big Mom is watching over it.

476
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,710
Really?

477
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,380
In exchange, we have to give her
large amounts of candy every month.

478
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,800
That's what the factory is for.

479
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,810
Candy?

480
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,420
If we're not protected by someone great like that,

481
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,300
the country would never survive.

482
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,760
It would become too dangerous here, since it's like the pirates' highway.

483
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,260
But if this Big Mom is protecting you in old man Whitebeard's place, she must be nice, right?

484
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,310
Hard to say... At least Whitebeard never asked for compensation.

485
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,900
Perhaps Big Mom just thinks of it like business?

486
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,960
Big Mom, huh?  One of the Four Emperors,
just like Shanks.

487
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,930
I wonder if I'll meet her someday?

488
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,430
Look up ahead!

489
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,900
We have reached the city of celebrities,
Fishverly Hills!

490
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,320
That huge building right in front of us
is Pappagg's house!

491
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,290
That?!  But he's just a starfish!

492
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,930
Coral Hill

493
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,230
This is bad.

494
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,030
Isn't that the Madame from the Mermaid Café?

495
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,430
What's wrong, Madame Shyarly?

496
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,140
Why are you so upset?

497
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,440
If we don't act quickly, something terrible will happen!

498
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,850
Hey, Madame... What do you mean?

499
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,520
Go look for him!

500
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,750
The pirate-boy wearing a straw hat...

501
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,020
Chase him out of the kingdom, right now!

502
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,230
Is this another prediction?

503
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,480
I didn't intend to look...

504
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,290
but I felt something from him, and ended up taking a peek...

505
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,370
at his future!

506
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,810
What's wrong?!  What did you see?!

507
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,240
Madame?!

508
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,160
Shyarly?!

509
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,600
Let it be wrong!  Please, let my prediction be wrong!

510
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,470
The human with the straw hat...

511
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,840
Straw Hat Luffy...

512
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,750
By his hands...

513
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,160
Fishman Island will...

514
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,110
be destroyed!
