1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:02,700


2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,390
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,940
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,300
It can be yours if you want!

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,450
Search for it!

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,820
I left everything in that one place.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,850
People now set sail in search of romance.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

10
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,090
Then hurry and get ready!

11
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,630
Let's go outside!  Right now!

12
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,130
What?  R-R-Right now?

13
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,370
B-But I...

14
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,220
Well... I'm not...

15
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,060
You're not what?

16
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,500
This is all so sudden, so...

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,110
I'm not... well...

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,320
sure what I should do yet.

19
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,070
Please give me some time.

20
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,740
It's just a walk, what's the big deal?

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,370
Really!  Make it quick, then!

22
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,510
I really don't like you.

23
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,460
Okay, okay!
I'll wait, so hurry and make up your mind!

24
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:26,300
{\an5}The Shirahoshi Kidnapping Incident and The Curse of the Mato Mato!

25
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,330
What have you guys done?!

26
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,230
Really,

27
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,640
you went way too far!

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,390
Indeed!  Apologize for your actions!

29
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,770
You were the ones who started this fight!  We're all in this together, you idiots!

30
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,310
We just wanted to threaten them and run away!

31
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,280
And I just wanted to go sightseeing and shopping.

32
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,660
Well, it's in the past now, so what can we do?

33
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,700
Don't complain!

34
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,190
"What can we do"?!  You think that's good enough?!

35
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,330
Just dropping by Fishman Island and then casually occupying Ryuuguu Palace...

36
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,790
How ruthless can you get?!

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,550
Ow...

38
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,920
So should we just have let them arrest us?!

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,930
I keep telling you, we should have just threatened them and fled!

40
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,430
First off, we don't know how we could escape.  Second, Luffy's not here!

41
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,150
Yeah, that's right, Luffy's gone!

42
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,480
Where did he go?

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,730
Where indeed?

44
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,940
We're really in a hurry here.
So don't be mean, and just tell us.

45
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,150
Yeah, we need to find Luffy!

46
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,990
Where is the treasure chamber?

47
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,940
Cut it out!

48
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,240
What?  Why?

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,450
Why are you acting all innocent?!  Consider our situation!

50
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,140
Now, everyone!

51
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,920
In this difficult time, let's sing a song and be happy!

52
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,290
Come on!

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,310
It'll work out somehow, it'll work out somehow.

54
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,700
And even if it doesn't, we'll die someday anyway!

55
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,450
Yeah!

56
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,640
You shut up too, Soul King!

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,430
Neptune-sama, are you alright?!

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,670
I can't believe that the champion of the sea, King Neptune, would end up like this.

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,050
My bad hip acted up
all of a sudden, so I couldn't fight.

60
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,880
I-I've really gotten old.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,580
Quite a blunder -jamon!

62
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,760
Sorry!

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,660
We should have moved quickly and burst their bubble,
turning it into an underwater fight,

64
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,580
but they managed to get rid of all the water instead!

65
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,620
What are we to do?

66
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,550
Listen up, you scum!

67
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,620
Once the three brothers of the Neptune Army, Prince Fukaboshi, Prince Ryuuboshi,

68
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,460
and Prince Manboshi get back here,

69
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,890
you're going to regret this!

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,200
In any case, we can't stay on Fishman Island any longer.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,310
Where is the Sunny?
We need to gather everyone up and set sail.

72
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,060
But the Sunny's coating was torn off
as we entered the island.

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,940
The Log Pose has been acting strange too.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,740
Ever since we came here,
it hasn't shown any sign of stabilizing.

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,370
You're hopeless.  You can't navigate
the New World with such a simple Pose.

76
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,450
You ignorant pirates.

77
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,650
Huh?  This won't work?

78
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,830
What do you mean?

79
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,290
I'll tell you if you untie me.

80
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,140
Ding-dong.

81
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,020
That must be Prince Fukaboshi!

82
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,730
Ding-dong.

83
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,690
Ding-dong.

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,610
{\an8}Akkamanbo!  Yay!  Yay!

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,460
Hmm?  How peculiar.

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,610
What could the guards be doing?

87
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,740
Click.

88
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,780
Hello, who is this? { def: maybe we should have a style for voice from speaker }

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
Hey!  Why are you answering?!

90
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,530
Prince Fukaboshi!

91
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,830
Help us!

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,410
Be quiet, you two!

93
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,000
Prince Ryuuboshi!

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,710
Prince Manboshi!

95
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,840
Oh my!  Brother, something
must have happened -la-ti-do!

96
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,610
I think so too!  Are Father and Shirahoshi alright?!

97
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,350
It's me, Fukaboshi.  What is going on in there?

98
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,600
Lower the connecting channel right now, and let us in.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,940
And what will happen if we do that?

100
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,440
No can do!

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,130
H-Hey!  What are you saying?!

102
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,600
Explain the situation to them!

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,530
That's right!  In that case, tie me and Caimie up too!

104
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,740
We don't want to be seen as your partners in crime!

105
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,600
Zoro-chin, you're scaring me!

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,010
Help us!  Prince Fukaboshi!

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,710
Are you, by any chance, one of Straw Hat's companions?

108
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,550
Fukaboshi!  He's the swordsman with the three swords from the Straw Hat Crew...

109
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,550
Pirate Hunter Zori!

110
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,510
It's Zoro!

111
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,600
Father?!

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,220
You've even got Father there?!

113
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,690
You hear that?  We've got plenty of hostages, including Neptune!

114
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,380
If you want them to live,
then start making preparations for us to set sail!

115
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,340
What we'll need is our ship, the Sunny, re-coated.

116
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,350
We don't know where it is, so you guys find it.

117
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,260
Also, the rest of our crew.

118
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,100
One gloomy woman.  One robot.

119
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,090
One raccoon dog, and one pervy water imp.

120
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,420
Oh, Zoro!  One billion beli, too.

121
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,130
Cut it out, damn it!

122
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,360
A pervy water imp!  How fitting!

123
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,040
That fits him perfectly!

124
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,670
This is no time to be laughing!

125
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,030
Pervy water imp!

126
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,320
Come on!  At least make a jab at the "gloomy woman" comment too!

127
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,620
I understand your conditions.

128
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,670
I will make arrangements for you and your crew
to leave this kingdom safely.

129
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,000
However, you must return all of the hostages unharmed!

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,210
Sure.

131
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,460
Brother!

132
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,300
We have no other choice.

133
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,720
The connecting channel is the only way
into Ryuuguu Palace.

134
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,600
Everywhere else, it's protected by a thick bubble layer
that we can't break through.

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,360
May I say one more thing, Zoro-kun?

136
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,900
I'd rather not tell you in this situation,

137
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,200
but I cannot dishonor my debt to Jinbe.

138
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,030
What is it?

139
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,410
From the former Warlord, Sea Knight Jinbe, to Straw Hat Luffy.

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,690
He wanted me to tell you this once you reached the island.

141
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,890
I have two messages to pass on.

142
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,340
Jinbe, huh?

143
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,760
Jinbe?!

144
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,340
Boss Jinbe.

145
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,930
Oh yeah, he did say that he was friends with Jinbe.

146
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,060
Ah, the man who was in the newspaper together with Luffy-san?

147
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,110
Despite being a pirate, he's an amazing man who everyone on the island trusts.

148
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,440
Luffy isn't here right now, but I'll pass the message on to him.

149
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,070
Say it.

150
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,910
"Don't fight Hody."

151
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,480
The second one is...

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,880
"I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."

153
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,210
That is all.

154
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,100
Click.

155
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,150
The Sea Forest... Hody...

156
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,490
Hey, did you hear?!

157
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,860
They really did it!

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,550
Apparently the Straw Hat Pirates have occupied Ryuuguu Palace!

159
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,390
What?!

160
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,420
What's their objective?!

161
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,510
No way!  And they seemed like such nice people.

162
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,610
How could they?

163
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,000
I just can't believe it!

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,130
Can't believe it!

165
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,550
No, I can totally believe it!

166
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,090
You can't believe it, can you?

167
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,670
So what if I can't believe it?

168
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,680
Kidnapping the girls from the bay,
and considering the future that was predicted...

169
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,720
It has to be them!
Things are progressing in that direction!

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,100
They've finally shown their true colors!

171
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,390
Apparently two of Straw Hat's companions are in the back room of the Mermaid Café.

172
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,570
The guards just went to capture them.

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,730
What is this creature?!

174
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,030
He transformed?!

175
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,530
Sanji is still recovering!  Don't touch him!

176
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,790
What do you mean "come to Ryuuguu Palace"?!  You're just planning to arrest us, aren't you?!

177
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,060
Hey... you guys...

178
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,820
Sanji!  You mustn't move around yet!

179
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,810
Hey!  Are you done thinking yet?

180
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,300
Let's go outside!

181
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,250
I'm so sorry.

182
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,470
I really... can't.

183
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,470
Why not?!  You said there were places you wanted to go, right?

184
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,640
But if I do something so selfish,

185
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,060
I'll be causing trouble for everyone in the castle.

186
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,230
If I'd been locked up in here for ten years,
I'd have gone crazy.

187
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,960
This is to thank you for the food.

188
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,200
I'll be there with you, so where do you want to go?

189
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,380
Uh... Well...

190
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,970
To the Sea Forest!

191
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,150
No, but...

192
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,680
that's just a dream.

193
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,400
I couldn't possibly do something
as selfish as breaking out of here.

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,110
Why are you starting to cry just from saying where you want to go?!

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,130
I-I'm sorry.

196
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,740
I had to gather up so much courage just to say it.

197
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,380
Please don't be mad at me!

198
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,990
You're scary, Luffy-sama!

199
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,050
You're such a pain!

200
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,630
What?!  What was that loud noise?!

201
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,260
Is he throwing something at us again?

202
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
What a rude guy.

203
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,810
What's that?

204
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,970
W-What is that sound -jamon?

205
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,190
Could it be Decken's doing?!

206
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,610
It's coming from Koukaku Tower -jamon!
S-S-Shirahoshi is in danger!

207
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,240
A-Are the guards with her?!

208
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,030
No, they're all tied up here!

209
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,110
How can this be?!

210
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, pirates!

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,540
Go and ensure the princess's safety in place of the guards!

212
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,580
Huh?  What're you talking about?

213
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,130
But Neptune-sama!
That means letting them know about the princess!

214
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,920
What choice do we have?!

215
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,490
Koukaku Tower is on the northeast side of the palace!

216
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,720
All of you, go there right now!

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,890
Why do we have to take orders from our hostage?

218
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,980
Silence!  Shirahoshi is my only daughter!

219
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,150
For that reason, she's constantly being targeted!

220
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:11,460
If anything happens to my daughter, I will drive you into the bottom of the deep sea!

221
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:17,230
So basically, she is the Mermaid Princess?  Am I right?

222
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,200
If so, I shall go to her as soon as I can!

223
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,910
And then!

224
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,880
I wonder if she will show me her panties?

225
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,340
Hey, wait, Brook!

226
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,430
Oh, what are we to do?!
He dashed off with indecent motives!

227
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,680
Now the princess is in danger
for an entirely different reason!

228
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
Wait, skeleton!

229
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,140
You can keep me tied up, but please take me with you!

230
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,190
Koukaku Tower is under my jurisdiction.

231
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,770
If anything happens to the princess,
I will never be at peace.  Even in death!

232
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,540
You...

233
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,000
You must...

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,580
really love her, right?

235
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,180
Don't be absurd!

236
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,050
How shameless!

237
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,840
No!

238
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,550
Sanji-san, I will be going there first if you don't mind!

239
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,810
I've always wanted to go to the Sea Forest.

240
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,810
All this time, throughout these past ten years.

241
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,360
But... everyone warns me that
it's too dangerous to leave the tower.

242
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,320
So I'm scared of going outside.

243
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,950
Luffy-sama, will you really take me there?

244
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,040
Sure.

245
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,620
Will you really protect me?

246
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,500
Leave it to me!  It'll be fine!

247
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,760
Hey!  If you're gonna cry, then I won't take you anywhere!

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,730
Besides, to be honest, it's more like you'll be taking me there.

249
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,390
I can't swim, after all.

250
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,570
I-I'm so sorry.  I'm just too happy.

251
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,090
You really are a crybaby, huh?

252
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,030
And a weakling.

253
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,820
But if we go outside, you'll stand out so much that you'll get spotted right away.

254
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,870
Right... I'm so sorry.

255
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,200
So I have an idea to deal with that!

256
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,400
Mermaid Princess!  Are you alright?

257
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,490
Hey, skeleton!  Look at the side of the tower!

258
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,000
Huh?

259
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,510
That's insane!  Those aren't the usual knives or axes that come flying!

260
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,760
That sound was human pirates crashing into the tower!

261
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
How bizarre!

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,150
That Vander Decken is insane!

263
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,900
What?!  V-Vander Decken?!

264
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,700
This isn't good!  They're getting up!

265
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:15,580
This means... Enemy soldiers have invaded the impenetrable Ryuuguu Palace!

266
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,920
This is a sneak attack!  The king is in danger!

267
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,420
The princess is in danger!

268
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,680
The sounds of the attacks have stopped, right?

269
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,470
Let's go, weakling!

270
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,790
Y-Yes!

271
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,010
I'm counting on you, Megalo!

272
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,720
Go, shark!

273
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,830
Megalo!

274
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,960
Luffy-san!

275
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,730
To the Sea Forest!

276
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,310
W-W-Wait!  Luffy-san?!

277
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,510
Hey!  Wait, Megalo!

278
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,470
Where are you going?!

279
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,940
Father, brothers, and everyone in the castle...

280
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,250
Please forgive me!

281
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm going out without permission!

282
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll be back in time for dinner!

283
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,740
Let's go for a walk!

284
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,120
What are you doing, Megalo?!

285
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,400
You left the door to Koukaku Tower wide open.

286
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
What if something happens to the princess?!

287
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,440
Pirate!  Hurry and see to the princess's safety!

288
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,380
You're working my bones too hard.

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,020
She's gone!  Princess Shirahoshi is gone!

290
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,740
What?!  The Mermaid Princess is not here?!

291
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,440
This is awful!  A national crisis!

292
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,360
When did this happen?  Who could have done this?!

293
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,530
She's been kidnapped!

294
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,800
Kidnapped?!

295
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,950
Princess!

296
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,180
Oh, princess.

297
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,870
She's been kidnapped, has she-

298
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,620
Hey!  What are you doing?!

299
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,750
The channel that connects
Ryuuguu Palace and Fishman Island...

300
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,280
Where is the switch to open it?!

301
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,140
What?  Switch?

302
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,220
Either way, we must hurry back to Neptune-sama, Skeleton!

303
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,810
We need to report this to him immediately!

304
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,480
We've got no choice.

305
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Following their orders is our only chance of survival.

306
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,700
Tell us already!

307
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,420
Who are "they"?

308
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,450
If you don't, they'll kill us!

309
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,450
Kill you?!

310
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,420
What are you talking about?!

311
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,880
Listen up, pirates working for Hody Jones!

312
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,230
You're in luck!
You get to be a part of this historic event!

313
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,710
Vander Decken...
Isn't he the captain of the Flying Dutchman?

314
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,770
The captain of the cursed ghost ship?

315
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,430
Don't worry, I'm just his descendant.

316
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,260
I'm not a ghost.

317
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,150
But I, too, have been cursed.

318
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm a fishman, yet I can't swim.

319
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,790
Let me show you the power of the devil
that I gained with the Mato Mato curse!

320
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,150
Alright, you'll do.  Human, come forth.

321
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,760
Hody!

322
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,270
Are you really going to do this?!

323
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,890
Stop this madness!

324
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,980
It's him!  Hachi-san!

325
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,940
It's Hachi-san!

326
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,070
It's Hacchan-san!

327
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,440
Hachi-san.

328
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,030
The Energy Steroid is just a drug that destroys your body!

329
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,990
Why are fishmen trying to destroy Fishman Island?!

330
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,790
Don't underestimate
the champion of the sea, Neptune!

331
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,830
Hachi-san, give it a rest.

332
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,830
I have no interest in your opinion.

333
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,800
I can hardly believe that
you were once a member of the crew I looked up to.

334
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,410
You've become weak.

335
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,100
Your time has passed.

336
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,260
I need Fishman Island if I want to teach
the humans a lesson, and Neptune is in my way.

337
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,650
You guys were the ones who taught us
that we are the superior species.

338
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,520
But Arlong-san lost!

339
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,820
Decken!  Hyouzou!  Why are you siding with him?!

340
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:58,150
You refused Arlong-san's invitation back then,
so why are you helping these young fools now?!

341
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,120
Helping?  I'm just working here because he pays me.

342
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,690
Arlong didn't want to part with his cash
so he couldn't employ me.

343
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,190
Too bad Arlong could only obtain a swordsman of your caliber.

344
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,050
So you're Hachi from Arlong's crew, huh?
Now that sure takes me back!

345
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,610
Your captain once tried to recruit me as his underling.

346
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,730
But I couldn't agree to that.

347
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,680
I could never let someone boss me around.

348
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,790
Hody here understands that.

349
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,580
Arlong-san's ambition and his
ability to act on it were admirable.

350
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,130
However, he was all brawn and no brains.

351
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:58,340
Even if we wanted to, we were too young to become pirates while you were out raising a ruckus at sea.

352
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,640
And now everyone who grew up in those days
has assembled here.

353
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,770
So our resolve is strong, and we've learned from our predecessors' mistakes.

354
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,100
I am the man who will carry on Arlong's will.

355
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,620
And you, a former member of the crew I admired, are saying that you have a problem with my plan?

356
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,250
That's really discouraging, Hachi-san!

357
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,690
And while we're on the subject, Straw Hat Luffy is here.  The very man who shattered your ambitions.

358
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,510
Don't you even care about that?!

359
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,670
He called me his friend,
even though I used to be a member of Arlong's crew!

360
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,310
The three of you are my friends! {Copy-paste from 394.}

361
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,570
I owe Straw Hat Luffy my life!

362
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,190
I would go to meet him right now...

363
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,600
but while Arlong's will lives on,
I couldn't possibly face him!

364
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,560
Humans are your friends?!  You piece of trash!

365
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm utterly disappointed in you!

366
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,830
I'm locked on to you, Hachi.

367
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,630
Have you forgotten how pirates do things?

368
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,200
If you have a problem with someone,
you'll have to resolve it with violence...

369
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,390
I presume!

370
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,440
Where'd he throw it?

371
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,930
When I touched you just now, you became my target.

372
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,190
Whatever I throw and wherever I throw it...

373
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,350
it will change its course like a hunting bird,

374
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,190
and head straight for its target: You!

375
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,590
It looked like he threw that knife in some random direction, and...

376
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,660
It hit the octopus fishman!

377
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,170
The Mato Mato curse...

378
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,780
Of course, there are several ways to stop it.

379
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,050
Why don't we give it a try?

380
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,180
Stop!  Don't throw all those arrows.

381
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,550
I've heard rumors about your ability.

382
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,350
Hey, Hody, he'll kill me at this rate!

383
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,950
Please, stop Decken!

384
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,370
Didn't he just tell you, Hachi-san?

385
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,840
Vander Decken is not my underling.

386
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,850
We're two pirates who have made an alliance on equal terms.

387
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,760
Besides, you're just a nuisance.

388
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,200
You damn coward!

389
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,540
Damn it!

390
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,380
Here we go!

391
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,880
Good!  Run away, run away!

392
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,350
But wherever you go...

393
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,260
Wherever you go...

394
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,060
Wherever you go... they'll chase you down!

395
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,850
If only I could make it outside.

396
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,190
Alright, now I can escape!

397
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,870
Those arrows won't be able to follow me in the water.

398
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,530
Damn!  So it doesn't matter
if they're in the water or not?!

399
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,110
Stay away!

400
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,510
The number of targets I can keep in my memory is the same as my number of hands.

401
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,390
Two of them.

402
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,990
My right hand, that I haven't washed for ten years,

403
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,310
stores the memory of when I touched
the princess of Ryuuguu Palace.  Shirahoshi herself!

404
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,320
You get it?!  All the love and weapons I throw...

405
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,110
will pursue my target even into the depths of Hell!

406
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,110
That is my power!

407
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,070
Amazing!

408
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,910
So that's how you've been able to keep up
your insidious stalker crush...

409
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,420
without being seen or caught by the Neptune Army!

410
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,870
Indeed!

411
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,720
What a cunning man!

412
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
{\an8}Cunning!  Cunning!

413
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,760
Now then, human pirates.

414
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,380
You understand Decken's ability now, right?

415
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,770
So now it's time to begin phase one of our plan.

416
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,370
They say it's impossible to
break into Ryuuguu Palace...

417
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,020
but one man has been able to
throw things in there for the last ten years.

418
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,470
Namely, Vander Decken.

419
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,460
In other words, this plan consist of you being the objects thrown by Decken...

420
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,180
and flying straight toward the Mermaid Princess in Ryuuguu Palace.

421
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,170
Though, you'll actually crash into the tower's hard walls.

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,980
Then, once you're inside Ryuuguu Palace, you'll open the gates from the inside,

423
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,890
and let us in.  That is your mission.

424
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,120
No way!  If you do that...

425
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,970
We'll crash into the walls and die!

426
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,620
Indeed you will.

427
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,210
Which is why we're using the lives of you worthless humans!

428
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,070
Down here, you're worth less than slaves!

429
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,690
Those who survive the crash will carry out the mission!

430
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,060
If it goes well, I will set you free.

431
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,890
If you refuse the mission, then...

432
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,950
I will throw you outside the bubble right now,
you inferior species!

433
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,740
N-No way!  If you do that, we'll drown!

434
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,500
In that case, you just have to take your chances on the method that leaves some slight chance of survival!

435
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,560
Go!

436
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,840
Today,

437
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,760
is the beginning of a new chapter in history for us fishmen!

438
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,100
It starts when we conquer the Ryuuguu Kingdom!

439
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,920
Yeah!

440
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,780
I'm coming now, Shirahoshi!

441
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,430
And now we return to the present.

442
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,920
Wait!

443
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
I will not wait!

444
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,900
Hurry, skeleton!  To the king!

445
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,640
Wait!  We have to open the way...

446
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,290
Or Hody will kill us!

447
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,490
Hey, Sanji!

448
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,910
He ended up...

449
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,210
beating up all the soldiers.

450
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,840
We hadn't done anything wrong!

451
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,540
Well, they wanted to put me in handcuffs!

452
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,140
Look!  Everyone is looking at us so coldly!

453
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,180
Their eyes are like the fish of the deep sea!

454
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,350
Oh, quit whining.  It's too late now.

455
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,620
You should have thought about that
before beating them up!

456
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,940
You took out half of them too!  With your Kung Fu!

457
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,340
You were pretty strong.

458
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,470
E-Even if you say that, I'm not happy at all, you jerk!

459
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,350
The voice of a lady!

460
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,940
Someone covered in blood has washed ashore!

461
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,870
Aren't you from the Fishman District?!

462
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,730
What happened?!

463
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,660
Someone, get a doctor!

464
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm a doctor!

465
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,870
Hachi?!

466
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,190
What happened to you?!

467
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,680
Hey, Hachi, it's us!

468
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,050
How did you get all those injuries?!

469
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,390
What happened?!

470
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,230
It's you guys.

471
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,820
I'm glad I found you.  Is Straw Hat here?

472
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,860
He's not.  Wait, I'll help you.

473
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,740
Gather your crew.  Hurry!

474
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,310
You're better off...

475
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,000
not getting involved in this island's affairs any more.

476
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
Leave Fishman Island.

477
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,160
The New Fishman Pirates are going to
attack this island!

478
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,660
Ryuuguu Kingdom will be destroyed!

479
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,180
Neptune-sama!

480
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,610
She's been kidnapped!
The princess was carried off by someone or another!

481
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,960
Also, a group of pirates came raining down by the tower.

482
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,480
Anyway, we are under attack!  Under attack!

483
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,730
Kidnapped?!  Who could have taken Shirahoshi?!

484
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,130
An enemy attack, now?

485
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,690
What are we going to do?

486
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,580
Why now?!
We're already attacking the palace ourselves!

487
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,920
W-What should we do?!

488
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,890
On second thought, don't answer that!

489
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,590
We'll cut them down.

490
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,890
I said don't answer!

491
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,460
If we're going to survive...

492
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,980
We have to open the gate to the palace!

493
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,860
H-Here they come!

494
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,080
Aren't you gonna come out of the shark now?

495
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,650
N-No, I'd rather stay inside.

496
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,590
How does it feel,
being outside for the first time in ten years?

497
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,370
My heart won't stop racing.

498
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,280
I have done something really awful.

499
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,110
Just going outside isn't bad!

500
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,140
You're so weird.

501
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,410
Is this...

502
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,750
what they call an "adventure"?

503
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,360
Yeah.

504
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,270
If you're this excited, then it's an adventure alright!

505
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,360
You said something about the Sea Forest, right?

506
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,970
What is that?  Is it a fun place?

507
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,100
A grave...

508
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,010
There's a grave there that I haven't visited once since it was built.

509
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,540
Not once in all these ten years.

510
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,460
It's the one place I've wanted to go to the most!

511
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,630
Has it really been ten years...

512
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:22,180
since the assassination that took place in broad daylight, throwing Fishman Island into chaos?

513
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,940
How time flies.

514
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,950
The princes have grown into fine warriors...

515
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,420
and Princess Shirahoshi is still inside that tower.

516
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,360
But nobody has forgotten about your ideals,

517
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,500
Queen Otohime.

518
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,900
The New Fishman Pirates arrive at the Ryuuguu Palace.

519
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:01,620
While there, Zoro comes into conflict with Hody.

520
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,700
Meanwhile, Luffy and Shirahoshi encounter Vander Decken on their way to the Sea Forest.

521
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,260
Next Time on One Pace: 

522
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,560
{\an5}The Beginning of the Vengeful Plan!
Zoro vs. Hody!
