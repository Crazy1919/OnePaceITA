1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,910
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,790
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:38,410
{\an5}Shaking of the Kingdom!
Luffy vs. Jinbe!

10
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,630
That was ten years ago.

11
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,910
Fukaboshi, Ryuuboshi and Manboshi...

12
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,260
Those three, together with the King and Princess,
have been reaching out to the citizens using monitors.

13
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,470
Thanks to their efforts,
we've regathered many of the signatures.

14
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,270
This is the battle against discrimination
that has been fought on this island for sixteen years.

15
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,270
And it's the reason why the Fishman Pirates
did what they did.

16
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,110
Arlong, the one who caused
so much suffering in your homeland,

17
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,090
was like a little brother to me.

18
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:21,180
We were planning to go after him
if he ever tried anything...

19
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:29,380
but Arlong bribed the Navy in the area and made sure that reports of his actions never reached Navy HQ.

20
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,390
Cut open your stomach!

21
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Sanji...

22
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,070
You can apologize with your death!

23
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,900
It still wouldn't be enough for me to forgive you,
but at least it might give Nami-san some peace!

24
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,660
Stop, Sanji-kun.

25
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,550
But, Nami-san... Think of what they did to you!

26
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,570
That has nothing to do with him.

27
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,080
After hearing his story,
it's clear that he meant no harm.

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,340
I will accept any punishment, if it makes you feel better-

29
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,930
Don't!

30
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't.  Arlong is the one I hate.

31
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,140
In any case, I'm glad you're not the mastermind behind the Arlong Pirates.

32
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,450
I mean, you're Luffy's friend, aren't you?

33
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,570
It's true.  I suffered a lot because of the Arlong Pirates,

34
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,920
but in that spiral of pain, I met many good friends too.

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,380
All of that made me who I am now.

36
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,680
I won't hate you just because you're a fishman.

37
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,060
So don't go apologizing for my life.

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,780
I don't regret it.  I'm having a lot of fun now!

39
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,750
So, whoever the culprit is... {Copy-paste from 546}

40
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,110
please don't be angry for me. {End copy-paste from 546}

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,050
Don't tell the people on our island anything! {Copy-paste from 543}

42
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,650
Not about the tragedy that befell us,
nor about our anger toward the humans. {End copy-paste from 543}

43
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,650
Don't let it get to you, Jinbe. {Copy-paste from 544}

44
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,450
You grew up in the Fishman District together.
You're like brothers.

45
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,490
No matter what happens,
you wouldn't be able to kill him.{End copy-paste from 544}

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
I don't deserve such kind words.

47
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,740
I am in your debt.

48
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,620
Nyuu- Nami!

49
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,760
Boss Jinbe-sama...

50
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,160
I totally understand
how tough it must be for you, Bro!

51
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,180
You're a real man, Jinbe!

52
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,560
Tiger... Otohime... I love you all!

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,690
Shut the hell up, Franky!

54
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,570
He was suffering so much...

55
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,110
Whaaat?!

56
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,920
Hey, wake up!

57
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,790
I sure slept well...

58
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,450
So, Jinbe...

59
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,350
What happened to the robber that Wimp's mom caught?

60
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,820
Did you sleep through the whole thing?!
That was the opening of the story!

61
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,860
Really?

62
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,070
Yeah!

63
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,900
You there... Your name is Shirahoshi, isn't it?

64
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,040
N-Nami-chin!  She's royalty!
You can't just address her as "You"!

65
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,610
Yes...

66
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,630
Please forgive me.
Remembering my mother made me cry.

67
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,430
She sounded like a wonderful mother.

68
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,310
Yes!

69
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,010
Your name is Nami-chin-sama, right?

70
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,160
Your Highness!  Nami-chin is just her nickname.

71
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,230
The -chin isn't actually part of her name.

72
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,820
This is the first time I've met you,
but it feels like I've known you since childhood.

73
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,700
I feel so relieved!

74
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,620
Really?  Maybe it's because our circumstances are kind of similar?

75
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,210
Well then, sorry for taking so much of your time.

76
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,430
First, we have to find out what's happening
at Ryuuguu Palace.

77
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,000
Hody and his crew attacked.
His Majesty and the guards have been captured.

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,350
Four of your companions are missing, and we don't know what they're doing.

79
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,180
That's all the information we have at the moment.

80
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,230
Nyuu- Jinbe-san.

81
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:01,990
If things are going according to Hody's plan, even worse things are happening around the country now.

82
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,840
You know what Hody is planning?!

83
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,220
I always suspected that he was planning something in the Fishman District after leaving the army...

84
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,300
but he never gave me an opportunity to find out what it was.

85
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah, I know his plan.

86
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,980
Hody hates humans even more than Arlong-san does.

87
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,190
It's like he's grown up by feeding on the anger and hatred of the fishmen.

88
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,870
But, he's clearly different from Arlong-san.

89
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,830
Arlong-san looked down on humans,
but he'd never hurt his fellow fishmen.

90
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,580
But with Hody...

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,550
Even if you're just a fishman who wants to live in peace with humans...

92
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,270
he will mercilessly attack you!

93
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,850
The World Council Meeting only takes place every four years and will happen this year, right?

94
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,890
We've gathered a lot of signatures.

95
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,110
This was going to be the year when
King Neptune finally let the world know...

96
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,910
that Fishman Island wants to emigrate to the surface!

97
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't tell me...

98
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,110
Hody wants to prevent that from happening?!

99
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,040
No, even more than that...

100
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,130
What is that?!

101
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,920
A gigantic Snail Phone?!

102
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,470
That's...

103
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,000
A Projector Snail!

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,650
What's it doing here?

105
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,340
Look!  The monitor is turning on!

106
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,030
It's projecting something onto the bubble layer.

107
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,030
That's...

108
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,400
It's him!

109
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,700
Nami-san, you know that guy?

110
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Nyuu- Hody...

111
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,880
Huh?  That's him?

112
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,610
Hacchin!

113
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,040
To all citizens of Fishman Island...

114
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,080
Can you hear me?

115
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,680
I am the captain of the New Fishman Pirates,
from the Fishman District...

116
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,950
Hody Jones!

117
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,230
Okay, next!

118
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,490
Next!

119
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Next!

120
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,640
You won't step on it, eh?!

121
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870
Please forgive us, Queen Otohime.

122
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,780
They'll kill me if I don't do this terrible thing.
I have no choice.

123
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,300
I'm so sorry, Queen Otohime.

124
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay, you pass.  Next!

125
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,140
This is no fun.

126
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,100
I didn't think that everyone would step on her.

127
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,350
No one respected Queen Otohime after all!

128
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,080
Daruma-san, Captain Hody is starting his broadcast.

129
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,070
Huh?

130
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,210
So he's in charge of all this?

131
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,020
He's the one who's making us step on the fumi-e?

132
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,500
Hey, isn't he the one that shot Otohime-sama's killer
right after her assassination?

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,260
That's right!  That's Hody Jones!  There's no doubt!

134
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,630
Wasn't he a soldier in the Neptune Army?

135
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,010
I have an announcement for everyone on Fishman Island.

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,390
This country will soon be destroyed.

137
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,930
And then it will be reformed under a new king...

138
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,700
who will be me!

139
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,460
What the hell is he saying?

140
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,670
What's he trying to pull?!
There's no way that'll happen!

141
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,120
Where is he broadcasting from?

142
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,550
Where is the King?

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,260
And didn't I hear something about
the Straw Hat Pirates occupying the palace?

144
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,550
What's happened to our country?!

145
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,030
And the new Fishman Island that I rule over
will have absolute laws.

146
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,950
At this moment,
people are coming here from the Fishman District.

147
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,270
They will be the new citizens of this land.

148
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,080
They hate the humans, just like we do.

149
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,930
They are comrades who wish to change this island,
just like we do.

150
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
What?  They're coming here?

151
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,020
Those lawless ruffians are going to live here?

152
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,110
I'm sure that most of you saw
the death of your beloved Queen Otohime.

153
00:12:52,910 --> 00:13:00,980
Queen Otohime had worked tirelessly in order to create a connection between us and the humans.

154
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,590
Who killed her?!  It was the humans themselves.

155
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:11,630
Even if you trust them and meet them halfway, humans will just stab you in the back!

156
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,140
Why can't you understand that?!

157
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,900
That bastard...

158
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,780
You've been led astray by the Neptune Family.

159
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,990
They are pushing you down a path that leads to death.

160
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,160
Their naive ideals are just
pretty words that can never come true!

161
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,220
Wishful thinking that will lead you to destruction!

162
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,120
No!

163
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,330
Look at this.

164
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,210
Father!

165
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,250
Father!

166
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,670
Father!

167
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,300
Your Majesty!

168
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,160
Even the once-great Knight Neptune has fallen to old age.

169
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,810
There is no future for this island
if an old man is left on the throne.

170
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,460
I guess that it's really our fault that the King was captured...

171
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
What?

172
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,230
Or Zoro's fault, really.

173
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,340
What did you do before you came here?!

174
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,820
Ah!  B-B-B-But Boss Jinbe!

175
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,920
There was a misunderstanding, and the Neptune Army
attacked Nami-chin and her friends.

176
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,110
It's time to end...

177
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,660
the old Ryuuguu monarchy.

178
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,080
Three hours from now, in Gyoncord Plaza,

179
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,210
we will cut off the head of this worthless king.

180
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,390
You've probably figured it out already, but I'm in Ryuuguu Palace.

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,310
We found something interesting here.

182
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,690
It's the piece of paper that Queen Otohime
risked her life to get from the Celestial Dragons...

183
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,030
ten years ago.

184
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,290
If it was destroyed,
they'd have no reason to ever give us another one.

185
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,710
Also... we have this huge box.

186
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,160
It contains the signatures
of over half of the subjects of this country.

187
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,100
Surely my eyes are deceiving me.

188
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,810
How could there be so many fools who think we should kiss and make up with the humans?!

189
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:26,650
Everyone who has written their name here
is opposed to my new kingdom.

190
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,740
In other words, this is a list of traitors.

191
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,580
You can quit using the fumi-e.

192
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,210
Anyone can lie and step on her face to pass that test.

193
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,580
But these signatures
show who supports me and who opposes me.

194
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,250
They are undeniable!

195
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,350
Let's start disposing of these people, one by one.

196
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,770
And finally...

197
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,510
The Straw Hat Pirates!

198
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,080
I have something good to show you.

199
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,860
I know you're somewhere on this island watching this.

200
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,220
These humans earned the wrath of all fishmen by destroying the ambitions of Arlong's crew!

201
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,590
Zoro!  Usopp!  Brook!

202
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,310
What the hell're those guys doing?

203
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,710
How could they have been captured?!

204
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Do it.

205
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,790
Yes, Sir!

206
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,770
Do it.

207
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,060
What?  What?  What's happening?

208
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,540
We're so high up!

209
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,060
I hear something...

210
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,960
A rumbling sound...

211
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,260
It's water!

212
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,560
Around the same time that we execute the King,
this room will finish filling with water.

213
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,360
Such inferior creatures.
Humans die from something as trivial as this.

214
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,700
Straw Hat Luffy, with a bounty of 400 million beli!

215
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,660
The heads of you and your companions
will serve as warnings to the humans on the surface.

216
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,620
Well, it's time to start cleaning up
the old Ryuuguu Monarchy.

217
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,680
We're going to leave behind the weakness of our past,
setting course for a strong future!

218
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,360
In three hours,
this country will be reborn as a proud Fishman Island!

219
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,900
How could this happen?

220
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,460
We won't let him do this!

221
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,770
Damn it!  The water keeps pouring in!

222
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,960
And I just finished drying out too, Usopp-san.

223
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,860
I don't want to be submerged in seawater again.

224
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,580
Neither do I!

225
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,870
Do something.  Anything!  Zoro-kun!

226
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,330
Sure thing.  Now then...

227
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,000
Get me out of these chains.

228
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,590
Got it!

229
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,840
Here it comes.
Chains, fall off... Chains, fall off...

230
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,950
Chains, fall off... Fall off chains!

231
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,020
Fall off!

232
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,440
It's no good... I don't have enough faith.

233
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,410
But did you see it?

234
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,190
The look on their faces when I started moving...

235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,920
Ding!  Ding!  Ding!

236
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,260
We have a winner!

237
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,140
It's... moving!

238
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,610
That's right.  I'm "Nothing but Bones" Brook!

239
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,040
Who's fault do you think it is that we ended up like this?!

240
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,500
Save me!  They'll kill me!

241
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,670
Ah, but I'm already dead.

242
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,490
Well, Nami and her group managed to get out, right?

243
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,380
We'll be fine if she manages to
get Luffy and the others.

244
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,370
And what'll you do if he doesn't come?!

245
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,330
Robin'll be all...

246
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,850
"I wonder if Nami was killed and eaten
by the deep-sea fish."

247
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,890
That's Robin, alright!

248
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,660
This is a bit different from
the other poneglyphs I've seen so far.

249
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,880
It's almost as if it's a letter... or a written apology?

250
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,670
Who are you apologizing to?

251
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,930
Who are you... Joyboy?

252
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,680
Did they just say that my bounty's at 400 million?!

253
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,380
When did it go up?

254
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,930
As if this is time for that!

255
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,980
They've picked a fight with us, no doubt.

256
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,440
After the great war in Marineford,
your fame shot up through the roof.

257
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,980
Once it surpasses 300 million,
it'll take a lot for them to raise it again.

258
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,790
Well, if they want a fight then we'll give them one!

259
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,510
Hey, wait, Luffy-kun!

260
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,510
Father...

261
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,680
Father...

262
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,020
Father!

263
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,100
Father!

264
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,510
Megalo!

265
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,070
We have to go save him!

266
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,670
Hold on a second, Princess Shirahoshi!

267
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,280
Stop, Megalo!

268
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,790
Wait!

269
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,170
Boss Jinbe-sama... But I...

270
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,340
Both you and Luffy,
you need to stop for a second.

271
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,720
Princess, I also think it's better if you don't go.

272
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,020
Hachi-sama.

273
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,680
In all of Ryuuguu Kingdom,
Hody's biggest fear right now is...

274
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,980
Princess Shirahoshi's power.

275
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,100
Even if he recreates Fishman Island
the way he wants it,

276
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,190
it will all be destroyed if the Sea Kings attack.

277
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,370
He took the King hostage to use him as a shield.

278
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,790
So in other words, their true goal is Shirahoshi-chan?

279
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:20,590
Nyuu- Hody isn't planning to
capture the Princess and use her power.

280
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,300
He fears the very existence of the power.

281
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,970
So he teamed up with Vander Decken, who wants the Princess's life.

282
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,930
Hody plans to get rid of everything that stands in his way.

283
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,400
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,820
If the Princess goes to the plaza it'll be just what he wants.

285
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,480
I've heard the prophecy about my power before,

286
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,160
but I've never been able to talk with the Sea Kings before.

287
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,660
I don't even know if I really have the power or not.

288
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,740
Either way, Hody will definitely want to finish you off.

289
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,350
But we can't let Hody find out
that you can't control the power.

290
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,140
We want him to be afraid of it.

291
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,070
You done yapping?

292
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,310
Alright then.

293
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,850
Shark!  Take me to Ryuuguu Palace!

294
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,630
Sanji, I'm leaving Wimp in your care.

295
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,980
Yes!  Leave it to me!

296
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,280
Didn't I tell you to wait, Luffy-kun?

297
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,490
Huh?

298
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,950
You mustn't fight with Hody!

299
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,320
Why're you trying to stop me?

300
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,290
Is it because we're human?

301
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,370
Don't include yourselves, that just complicates things!

302
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,050
That's right!  It can't be you!

303
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,960
The fishmen who don't hate humans already may wind up changing their minds!

304
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,720
Leave this to me.

305
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,470
Jinbe!  My friends have been captured!

306
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,480
If I don't do something, they'll be in trouble!

307
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,100
Luffy-chin...

308
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,900
Straw Hat...

309
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,980
You still don't understand, after everything I said?!

310
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm going.

311
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,740
You don't understand a damn thing!

312
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,820
Blah blah blah... shut up!

313
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,120
If you want me to stay, then try to stop me!

314
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,010
Luffy...

315
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,590
It was foolish to think you'd listen to me, even after we've fought side by side.

316
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,400
I had almost forgotten...

317
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,400
that you are his brother.

318
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,240
Since you don't intend to stay here,
there's no other way to do this.

319
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,050
Luffy-chin... Boss Jinbe...

320
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,010
Luffy!  Jinbe!  Hang on!

321
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,850
What are you two doing?!

322
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm gonna go to Ryuuguu Palace, rescue my friends,

323
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,940
and send that Hody guy flying!

324
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,450
And I'm telling you not to be rash!

325
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,410
Hey, now!  Why are you fighting?

326
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,120
Stop it, you two!

327
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,660
Luffy-sama... Boss Jinbe-sama...

328
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,290
Shark, give me a ride!  To Ryuuguu Palace!

329
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,840
I'm telling you, wait!

330
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,340
Get out of my way!

331
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,920
{\an8}Fishman Karate

332
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,390
{\an8}Shark Tile True Fist

333
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,770
What?!

334
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,800
Luffy-chin!

335
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
What?!

336
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Luffy-sama!

337
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,540
T-That hurt...

338
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,870
What?!  It worked!

339
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,740
I thought physical attacks couldn't hurt a rubber man!

340
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,180
The true power of Fishman Karate
lies in its ability to control all water that it hits.

341
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,750
It creates a shockwave, from the water in the air
to the water inside one's body.

342
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,350
All living creatures are clusters of water.

343
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,020
Even a rubber man can't escape it!

344
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,740
You bastard!

345
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,090
I will not let you go, Luffy!

346
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,750
Is that all you got out of your training?

347
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,460
I'm not done yet!

348
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,810
That's enough.

349
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,300
Robin!

350
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,640
Robin-chwan!

351
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,980
Hey, get out of the way, Robin! {Gil : End of line cut off by keyframe.}

352
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,980
Who are you?!  Move!

353
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,230
Robin-chan is in trouble!

354
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,730
Huh?

355
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,400
Robin-chan...

356
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,210
You mustn't fight.

357
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,130
I don't know the circumstances here, but aren't you on the same side?

358
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,510
Huh?!  How did Robin get to the forest?!

359
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,760
Well then, here I go.

360
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,620
Hey, wait a second!

361
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,510
Explain what the hell is going on!

362
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,390
You can even do that now?

363
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,190
Oh yes, it happened...

364
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,230
back when I was touring the world as the Soul King.

365
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,800
Booooone!

366
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,470
Wait, whaaaaaat?!

367
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,980
What is going on?!

368
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,390
This technique even lets me slip through walls.

369
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,800
What do you think I did?

370
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,550
If you are a man, I am sure you already understand.

371
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,830
I'm so jealous! Zoro, he's making me jealous!

372
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,590
Shut up!

373
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,000
It's time to leave for the execution stand.

374
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,150
Should we leave someone behind
here in Ryuuguu Palace, Boss Hody?

375
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,500
No, there's no need.

376
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,470
Ryuuguu Palace is impenetrable.

377
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,120
Just leave behind a few gatekeepers
to open the gates when we return.

378
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,220
We can't have the King
locked out of his own castle, after all!

379
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,260
Yeah, you've got a point there!

380
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,100
You're no King -jamon!

381
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,820
You can't win the hearts of the people with violence!

382
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,570
You've only got a few hours left to live.
Spout whatever nonsense you'd like until then.

383
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,990
My wound is aching.

384
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,330
The wound from that arrogant swordsman.

385
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,370
The painkillers are wearing off.  Give me the Energy Steroids.

386
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,300
S-Sure...

387
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,350
The pain is gone.

388
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,300
Will he really be alright, taking that many?

389
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,350
G-Good question...

390
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,150
Boss, what about those three Straw Hats?

391
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,620
They're just humans.  Leave them alone, and they'll drown before long.

392
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,370
Even if someone tries to save them,
it's impossible to break into the palace.

393
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,710
More importantly... How are things going
with the new citizens from the Fishman District?

394
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,420
No problems at all.

395
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,850
They've already started to move in.

396
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,300
I see.  They'll have places to live soon enough.

397
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,350
Many people will leave the country or be killed.

398
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,190
They can just use their houses.

399
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,580
This will become a fine country,
where everyone despises the humans!

400
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,740
I have found our light of hope!

401
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,690
Everyone seems to have disappeared for some reason,
and the palace looks empty...

402
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,420
but Pappagg-san has been left behind!

403
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,470
Then, Brook.  Ask Pappagg to
look for the keys to these chains right away.

404
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,760
Oh, and the cage, and the room-

405
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,300
Hang on, idiot.

406
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,310
I just need one sword.  Bring my swords here.

407
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,850
I'll cut through all our obstacles.

408
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,930
Whoa, you're too reliable!

409
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,490
I have arrived, with a "bone"!

410
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,110
Ghost!

411
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,660
Wait!

412
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,540
Ghosts are so scary!

413
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,510
Pappagg-san, it's me!

414
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,050
We're in a hurry!

415
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,260
Umm, get the key... No, a sword!

416
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,960
Umm, listen...

417
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,260
Stay away from me!

418
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,880
Noooooo!

419
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,300
Don't be like that!  Listen to me!

420
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,680
Wait!

421
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,480
Just think about this, Luffy.

422
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,190
What do you think will happen
if you just go wild on Fishman Island?

423
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:47,260
Whenever fishmen have tried to open their hearts to humans, the humans have only worked against them.

424
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,950
"Humans are brutal creatures."
"Humans discriminate against fishmen and hate them."

425
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:59,880
The harsh reality of the situation is that history has taught fishmen to see things in a negative light.

426
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,050
Even in the case of Arlong,

427
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:10,140
more than a few of us think that humans hunted him down just because he was a fishman.

428
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,260
And if you, the very same people who defeated Arlong,

429
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,640
were to attack Hody as well, what would happen?

430
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,330
Even if you saved Fishman Island from this crisis...

431
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:28,280
they'd see you attack Hody,
who is taking a stand against humanity.

432
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,910
It will just remind them of Fishman Island's history,
and convince them that things will never change.

433
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,090
So you say, but Jinbe...

434
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,420
It's natural for us to want
to save our captured companions,

435
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,640
and if we leave things the way they are,
then Fishman Island will fall under Hody's control.

436
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,350
We've got many friends here on this island.

437
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,020
Hey, Hachi.

438
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,800
You seem determined not to tell us
who gave you those wounds,

439
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,760
but you also said...

440
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,040
that Hody will even attack fishmen
who want to be friends with humans, right?

441
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,220
You...

442
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,090
were attacked because you stood up for us, weren't you?

443
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,170
Hachi...

444
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,610
Hacchin...

445
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,260
Is that true?  Did Hody and his men do this to you?!

446
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,880
Well...

447
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,140
Jinbe.  To Luffy, knowing that this is your country
just gives him another reason to fight.

448
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,440
We can't just leave this island behind.

449
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,550
We have a reason to fight.

450
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,080
After all...

451
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,530
Caimie-chan is here!

452
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,780
Shirahoshi-chan is here too!

453
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,620
Indeed!  This country is the Mermaid Paradise
of my dreams!

454
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,370
Get out of my way, Jinbe.

455
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,350
I said I'm going, so I'm going.

456
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,920
I will not let you!  Leave this to me!

457
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,030
Why, you!  I'll just have to send you flying and then go!

458
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,230
If you won't listen to what I say,
I'll stand up to you as many times as I must!

459
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,380
What was that?!

460
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,780
Stop it, you two!
