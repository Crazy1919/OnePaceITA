1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,390
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,940
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,710
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,320
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,840
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,860
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,560
Hmm?  What?

10
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,390
I lost sight of him.

11
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,310
The one with stripes.

12
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,800
You fool.  I'm right here!

13
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,540
But by the time you realize it, you'll already be dead!

14
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,940
Take this!

15
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,030
I hear a voice over here!

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,210
Z-Zeo-san was...

17
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,890
beaten!

18
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,480
Did you see what just happened, skeleton?

19
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,290
Thanks to my weapon destruction skill, Sword-Crush With My Body...

20
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,530
the tip of your sword...

21
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,250
is crumbl-

22
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,280
I stabbed you, didn't I?

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,080
Even after getting stabbed, he's still so prideful!

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,060
Feel free to think so... and then be deth-

25
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,820
...and then be destroyed!

26
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,880
You fool!

27
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,920
Huh?!  What?!

28
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,370
I lost sight of him again!  Where is he?!

29
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,020
{\an8}Hidden God Flail

30
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,950
{\an8}Six-Six Head {Note: Literally "Six-Six". Not "Sixty-six."}

31
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,400
I... figured it out.

32
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,230
During the past two years,
I learned the true power of the Yomi Yomi Fruit.

33
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,260
When someone dies,
their soul typically departs for the underworld.

34
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,610
However, my soul continues to exist in this world...

35
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,050
thanks to a powerful energy
that emanates to keep my body alive.

36
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,460
By playing music,
I'm able to move other people's souls.

37
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,090
I can drag them into the spiritual world,
and even show them illusions at times.

38
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,630
If my soul leaves my body,
people can see its form clearly.

39
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,340
It most certainly exists in this world!

40
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,460
I've done it!

41
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,630
I've taken down one of the Straw Hat Pirates!

42
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,510
No.

43
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,800
The power that keeps me in this world does not come from my organs.

44
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,860
Nor from my muscles.

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,660
Indeed...

46
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,880
It's my soul!

47
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,530
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!

48
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,470
Oh!  That got me pumped up!

49
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,870
Alright!

50
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,660
He's bluffing!

51
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,410
Do you understand?

52
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,480
Unless you completely shatter my bones,

53
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,970
damage to my skeletal body doesn't matter!

54
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:35,130
{\an8}Shikomizue: A Sword Cane {...Yeah, apparently this is actually a thing. Wikipedia refers to it by the Japanese name and everything.}

55
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,700
And...

56
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,130
I had the Longhand Tribe sharpen this shikomizue.

57
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,740
Its name is Soul Solid!

58
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,560
I imbue its attacks with my soul,

59
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,010
bringing the cold of the underworld into our world!

60
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,120
Behold...

61
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,500
my freezing sword!

62
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,390
That's awesome, Brook!

63
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,150
I can't let him outshine me!

64
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,370
Everyone's got something new
to help them in the New World.

65
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Are you really so concerned about your friends?!

66
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,140
Don't worry about it!
All of you will soon be scrap lying on the ocean floor!

67
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,740
{\an8}Fire Daruma Cutter

68
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,730
Hot hot hot hot!

69
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,560
Damn you!

70
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,240
A guy like you is just holding your crew back!

71
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,690
You're firing one dud after another!

72
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,740
Don't be so impatient, little mole shark.

73
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm a cookie cutter shark!

74
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,600
I just...

75
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,130
finished setting my trap!

76
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,230
I'm putting an end to this!

77
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,170
You won't put an end to anything!

78
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,480
Die!

79
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,180
{\an8}Arming

80
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,260
I'll rip that arm of yours to shreds!

81
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,650
Luffy-sama!

82
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Weak-hoshi!  Take me to the Noah!

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,250
Okay!

84
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,410
As fast as you can!

85
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,360
Okay!

86
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,410
What are you doing?!

87
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,690
I... won't run!

88
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't be ridiculous!  Can't you see the Noah?!

89
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,380
I know!  I know, but...

90
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,580
hearing what Straw Hat is doing...

91
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,270
reminded me...

92
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,690
of when I was a kid, twenty years ago!

93
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,990
Of that one human this whole country is indebted to!

94
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,920
This is one great catch!

95
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,440
Wait!

96
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
No!

97
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,390
Who are you?!  Don't you value your own life?!

98
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,150
Huh?!

99
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,620
Hey, you're kidding, right?!

100
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,820
Why would he...

101
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,950
side with the fishmen?!

102
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Neptune helped me out once, long ago.

103
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,280
We exchanged the drink of friendship!

104
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,180
S-Spare our lives!

105
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,000
We'll never kidnap fishmen or mermaids again!

106
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,400
Don't cause any trouble in my friend's country!

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,230
You snot-nosed brats!

108
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm making this island...

109
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,690
my turf!

110
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:05,450
You mean Whitebeard?  You trust these guys
as much as you trusted that great pirate?!

111
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,010
You know... I actually hate humans...

112
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,390
and this is the fishmen's country... yet he was...

113
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,460
We made the decision with Jinbe when we entered the plaza. {Copy-paste from 564}

114
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,400
We won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!

115
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,340
You can leave it all to us, Bro-hoshi!

116
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,870
We're friends, ain't we? {End copy-paste from 564}

117
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,720
He said something like that,
and is putting his life on the line!

118
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,550
Air!

119
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,050
He's as tough as the elite bounties.

120
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,950
My fangs aren't just for show!

121
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,960
Humans don't seem to learn their lesson
until they're dead.

122
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,400
You're weak, and you don't know your place!

123
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,770
So why don't I make you understand?!

124
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,380
I don't have time for this.

125
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,440
It's time we settled this!

126
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,190
Sure, go ahead and try!

127
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,030
Weak-hoshi!  Get back!

128
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,580
O-Okay! { pls time }

129
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,970
{\an8}Fishman Way of Yielding

130
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,610
{\an8}Water Heart

131
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,480
{\an8}Swarm of Sharks/Rainshower

132
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,970
You're not getting away!

133
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,960
Die!

134
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,150
Just give it up... and die!

135
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,270
Fall... Noah!

136
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,300
Kill all the... fishmen...

137
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,980
who have lost their pride!

138
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,550
He...

139
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,020
He did it!

140
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,960
This time, he really...

141
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,670
beat Hody!

142
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,980
We're done for!  Both us, and the island!

143
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,890
Let's get out of here!

144
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,360
Zeo-san!  Give us a break!

145
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,760
The island's...

146
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,870
Don't be fooled!

147
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,850
We were chosen by the heavens.

148
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,830
Captain Hody and his crew...

149
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,840
could never be defeated by mere humans!

150
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,320
B-But if the Noah crushes the island, we'll all...

151
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,610
Death still counts as revenge.

152
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,140
Our deaths will feed the hatred of humans in others!

153
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,300
This tragedy will become our flesh and blood.

154
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,660
Our malice will live on.

155
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,680
It will be passed on to the next generation,
and we will surely have our revenge!

156
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,680
There he is.

157
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,980
Captain Hody and the commanders are all insane!

158
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,680
It's the humans who made us like this!

159
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,350
Do not retreat!

160
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,510
Direct all your rage toward the humans -bogon!

161
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,170
The calamity that is hanging over all of fishmankind...

162
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,850
is entirely the humans' fault -zugan!

163
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,250
Are the humans really... that scary?

164
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,220
Don't be ridiculous!

165
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,660
True, historically speaking, the humans have-

166
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,690
Stop.

167
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,330
Madame Shyarly.

168
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,600
Look for yourselves.

169
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,140
Right now, in the plaza and in the sky above,

170
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,120
the ones fighting against the pirates from the Fishman District...

171
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,290
are humans.

172
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,210
Are all those guys... really human?

173
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,340
True, some of them look pretty strange.

174
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,170
But still, we must see this for ourselves.

175
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,280
We have no right to say anything if we don't.

176
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,870
Whatever happens now...

177
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,810
you must watch with an open mind!

178
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,110
Anyone who isn't willing to die in battle...

179
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,520
can die by my hands,
and live on in the grudge against the humans!

180
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,670
Stop this!  They are your allies!

181
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,930
I'm saved!  Thank you, Skeleton Mask!

182
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,600
You again?

183
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,300
You sure talk about death a lot
for someone who has never died!

184
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,610
Die and live on in a grudge?!  Preposterous!

185
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,040
Nothing remains after death!

186
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,790
When a creature dies,
there's nothing left but dead bones!

187
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,590
You're really convincing!

188
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,910
Very kind of you!

189
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,610
I really hate people who throw their lives away!

190
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,740
It makes me sick to my stomach.

191
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,390
Even though I have no stomach to be sick!

192
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,920
Aren't you the ones who are throwing your lives away?

193
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,280
All of you staying here
without even trying to run away...

194
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,130
when you humans are the ones
who will undoubtedly die once the Noah crashes!

195
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,780
Granted, I'm not sure you're really human!

196
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,350
Our Captain Luffy is going to be
the Pirate King someday.

197
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,330
And that captain just said...

198
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,000
that he won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!

199
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,690
That we could leave it all to him!

200
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,830
As long as we believe in him, why would we worry about anything?

201
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,800
Now, it's time for me to fulfill my own mission!

202
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,920
I won't take my eyes off you again!

203
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,630
Even though I have no eyes!

204
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,410
How's dis?!

205
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,860
Surprised?!

206
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah, that's more than enough.  Oh, I am so surprised.

207
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,010
Really?

208
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,450
Alright... Let's end this, Jinbe.

209
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,750
Indeed, it's time!

210
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,260
Hey, wait... I lost my swords.

211
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,520
How am I supposed to fight?

212
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,340
Hell if I know.

213
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,170
You're so impudent!

214
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,620
I'm gonna settle this in one hit,
with the debut of my new super move!

215
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,260
One finger... Two fingers...

216
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,070
When I raise the third finger,
I will snipe you and this fight will be over!

217
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,600
What kind of foolish fantasy are you living?!

218
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,640
Wake up from your stupid daydream, you puny bastard!

219
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,490
Can't admit your defeat?!

220
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,040
It's funny... I'm actually surprised too.

221
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,570
I used to spout lies all the time...

222
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,840
but now I can do the stuff I boast about!

223
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,810
What's that monster?!

224
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,630
Where did that thing come from?!

225
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
T-That's...

226
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,610
Chopper?!

227
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,230
T-That little runt... grew huge all of a sudden!

228
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,060
Hey!  Hey, hey!

229
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,830
There was no need for you to go berserk!

230
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,860
It's alright, Usopp!

231
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,510
Chopper!  What do you mean, it's alright?!

232
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,570
I'm now able to fight in this form for three minutes,
using the Rumble Ball!

233
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,100
It isn't like it was before!

234
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,990
I won't cause you guys any more trouble!

235
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,840
I don't believe it!
You're not going berserk, you're helping us out!

236
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,490
How dependable you've become!

237
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,480
S-

238
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,360
Saying that won't make me happy, you jerk!

239
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,300
That's just scary!

240
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,450
You gotta be kidding me -dosun!

241
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,620
It doesn't matter how big you become, I'm still gonna blast you to the ends of the sea -gogyan!

242
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,420
You won't be able to blast me anywhere!

243
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,320
Now, bring it!

244
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
Chopper!

245
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,740
Chatting with your friends during a fight?!
Know your place!

246
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,070
You're nothing but a hindrance to your crew!

247
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm gonna finish you off right now!

248
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,480
Didn't I tell you that I've got a trick up my sleeve?

249
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,470
Now, bring it on!  I'll show you my magic tricks!

250
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,810
Interesting!  You say
you're gonna finish me off in one hit?

251
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,220
Even if the Dried Squid Spear doesn't work on you,

252
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,570
I've been concealing a powerful spear that can penetrate anything!

253
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,030
Light up!

254
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,870
{\an8}Mortar Bon Spear

255
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,980
You're the one who'll be dropped with a single hit -hi!

256
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll pierce a hole right through the robot into the driver's seat -hi!

257
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,250
That is rather cool, but...

258
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,150
it's no use.

259
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,010
Against my ultimate weapon, you are...

260
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,470
just an inferior squid!

261
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,450
I can't fight bare handed.  What should I do?

262
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,730
I can't cut someone down who has no will to fight.

263
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,740
Get lost, damn frog.

264
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,150
Frog?

265
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,760
Yer gonna end dis?  Dat's mah line!

266
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,650
Don't think ya just tricked me into inflatin', ya idiots!

267
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:23,070
Ah'm gonna roll around an' flatten all yer friends in da plaza!

268
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,900
This is my range, skeleton man.

269
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,710
The moment that you enter this circle,
your bones will all be shattered to dust!

270
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,500
Now, what will you do?!

271
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,950
Now then, if you'll excuse me...

272
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,600
I already entered your circle and cut you.

273
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,640
It is quite cold out.  Please take care.

274
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,750
When did you...

275
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,590
{\an8}Grazing Song

276
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,350
{\an8}Blizzard Slash

277
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,470
And now a poem...

278
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,040
May the winds of the underworld...

279
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,950
which can freeze blood...

280
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,880
lift skirts as well.

281
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,420
Die!

282
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,660
What's that?!

283
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,490
These plants have man shaped roots...

284
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,860
that jump at anyone who passes above them...

285
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,780
and cling onto them!

286
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,640
What is it now?!

287
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,340
It sends intruders flying!

288
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,100
And now, with you flying high into the air,
there's no way for you to dodge!

289
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,100
A beast from the surface?  I'll rip it to shreds!

290
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,480
Bad idea.  The bulb on the tip of its nose...

291
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,390
releases a powerful shockwave
that hits anything within three meters!

292
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,040
Dosun!  Dogan!  Bogan!

293
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,540
Now, fly into the horizon!

294
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,840
Gadon!  Megagon!

295
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,940
{\an8}Cloven-Hoof Palme

296
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,840
Dogyan!

297
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,750
Pi... Pikon...

298
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,960
Squid!  Squid!  Squid!

299
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,510
Take this!  The spear
that even penetrates underwater mountains!

300
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,180
Squid!  Squid!  Squid!

301
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,930
Dried squid!

302
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,890
A beam?!

303
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,210
{\an8}Fishman Karate Secret Technique

304
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,410
{\an8}Vagabond Drill

305
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,450
Whaaaaat?!

306
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,010
The water... pierced right through his body!

307
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,550
Da air's leaking.

308
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,830
How do you like the sky, balloon pufferfish?

309
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,290
A human flying in da sky?!

310
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,570
Ya scared da guts outta me!

311
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,640
Think back on the past two years...

312
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,390
Sanji-kyuuun!

313
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,870
Why did I have to go through all that?!

314
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,600
He's on fire!

315
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm gonna burn those memories to ash!

316
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,330
I scared the guts out of you?
Well, that saves me some trouble.

317
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,150
When cooking pufferfish,
one has to be careful to remove the poisonous meat.

318
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,450
Have a taste of my poisonous blades!

319
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,870
Knock it off, damn frog.

320
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,670
I'm not a frog!

321
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:46,180
I'm Fishman Island's number one!
The Hattouryuu-using octopus, Hyouzou!

322
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:46,180
{\an8}Hattouryuu: Eight-Sword Style

323
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,090
Remember it!

324
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,600
{\an8}Purgatory Demon Slash

325
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,200
So sorry.

326
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,960
I confused you with the proverbial frog...

327
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,980
in a well.
