1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,890
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,260
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,400
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,020
Those terrifying commanders...

10
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,570
didn't stand a chance!

11
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,130
Just how strong are these people?!

12
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,720
Wake up!

13
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,140
Look out below!

14
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,800
This is gonna be dangerous!

15
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,240
Wadatsumi is...

16
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,830
falling on us!

17
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,950
You should've dropped him further away,
you clumsy cook!

18
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,680
Shut it!  Or else I'll drop him on your head next time!

19
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,600
You're amazing, Sanji!

20
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,410
Hey, Chopper!  Shrink down a bit!

21
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,170
You're making my giant robot look small!

22
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,650
Franky, that beam was awesome!

23
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,800
Was that robot actually good for anything?

24
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,760
Nami-san!

25
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,850
What?

26
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,540
Please wear a miniskirt!

27
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,420
Shut it!

28
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,050
Exactly what I'd expect from Luffy-kun's crew.

29
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,290
Hey...

30
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,650
The N-Noah!

31
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,250
The Noah is almost on top of us!

32
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,170
Run!

33
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,450
The island's gonna be crushed!

34
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,600
If we hang around for too long,
the Neptune Army's gonna trap us in the plaza!

35
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,630
Hurry!  Those insane commanders are gone!

36
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,870
Are you alright?

37
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,160
Is it too late?!

38
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,740
Didn't it work... Straw Hat?!

39
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,380
Straw Hat!

40
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,610
He still...

41
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,640
isn't giving up!

42
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,540
Straw Hat Luffy-san...

43
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,330
is doing all he can...

44
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,480
to destroy...

45
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,160
the Noah!

46
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,090
Luffy-sama!

47
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,050
If he can destroy the Noah before it crashes...

48
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,860
then the island will be saved.

49
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,980
But if he can't make it...

50
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,540
Fishman Island will be destroyed!

51
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,630
Show us what you can do, Luffy!

52
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,070
Luffy-san!

53
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,180
Luffy!

54
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,590
Luffy!

55
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,570
Luffy-kun!

56
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,790
You have to do it, Straw Hat!

57
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,180
That's right, Straw Hat!  We're cheering for you!

58
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,290
Hang in there, Straw Hat!

59
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,350
You're human, yet you're fighting for us!

60
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,170
We're not gonna run away!

61
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,140
Hang in there, Big Brother Straw Hat!

62
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,220
Fishman Island is in your hands now, Straw Hat!

63
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,550
Go, Straw Hat!

64
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,700
We believe in you!

65
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,330
Straw Hat!

66
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,510
Straw Hat!

67
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,910
Straw Hat!

68
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:42,890
Straw Hat!

69
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,610
Stop! Noah!

70
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,310
Stop!

71
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,240
Luffy-sama!

72
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,050
Your wounds are opening!

73
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,820
Stay away!

74
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,490
Watch from over there!

75
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,360
Right now, I gotta put everything I got
into destroying this thing!

76
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,930
Stop right there, ship!

77
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,470
Father, I'm so sorry.

78
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,640
We must destroy the Noah.  There's no other way.

79
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,720
Straw Hat!

80
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,190
It's the ship of promise... {Same phrasing as in 558}

81
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,650
but we have no other choice. Our lives are more important.

82
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,680
Forgive us.  It looks like
we won't be able to keep our promise -jamon...

83
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,350
Joyboy.

84
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,810
Stop!

85
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,060
Who's there?!

86
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,490
Luffy-sama, please stop!

87
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,470
Luffy-sama!  I beg of you, stop!

88
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,320
Get out of my way, Weak-hoshi!
If I don't destroy it, the island's gonna...

89
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,200
It's alright!

90
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,580
Of course it's not!  Everyone's still on the island!

91
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,820
The Noah has already...

92
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,060
stopped!

93
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,210
Sea Kings?  Why?

94
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,150
Luffy-sama yelled at me again!

95
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,660
Hey, this is no time to worry about that!

96
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,480
I don't understand it either.

97
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But...

98
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,970
the Noah has been stopped.

99
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,180
What is this?!

100
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,180
What's going on?  The Sea Kings stopped the ship!

101
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,050
Luffy-sama!  Your wounds have opened!

102
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,650
You're covered in blood!

103
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,350
W-Well... whatever.

104
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,300
As long as... the ship stopped.

105
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,220
I'm just glad... everyone's... safe.

106
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,170
Luffy-sama!

107
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,450
It's alright.

108
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,340
My, what a remarkable human.

109
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,310
What a strong human.

110
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,680
Even if we'd been late,
the island might have still been saved...

111
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,250
but the Noah would have been completely destroyed.

112
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,250
I'm so glad we made it.
Good thing Princess Shirahoshi called us here.

113
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,130
I couldn't do anything... I was so sad.

114
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,030
That's not true.  You were touched
by the Straw Hat child's strong emotions...

115
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,360
and you made a wish.

116
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,380
An impassioned wish...

117
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,180
that you could help him save the island.

118
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,430
Our power is your power.

119
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,780
You summoned us to help him.

120
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,990
A-Attention everyone.

121
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,670
T-This is unbelievable.
It'd take too long to explain it all...

122
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,950
but it's the undeniable truth.

123
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,190
The Noah has stopped!

124
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,900
It wasn't completely destroyed either!

125
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,610
Fishman Island... has been saved!

126
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,980
Straw Hat did it!

127
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,390
Princess Shirahoshi.

128
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,840
We've waited a long time for you to be born.

129
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,590
Me?

130
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,250
This ship was built so we could pull it.

131
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,450
The tale of the ship has been passed down since the old times, so that we may do so.

132
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,170
Is that why the Noah is so big?!

133
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,970
Yes.

134
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,910
Once every couple hundred years,
our king is born into the body of one of the merfolk.

135
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,700
I wonder why?

136
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,430
Why indeed.

137
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,180
It's you.

138
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,450
Ever since you have been born,

139
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,510
you have been our Queen.

140
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,430
Honorable brother!

141
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,780
Yeah... Shirahoshi... She can't be...

142
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,750
She must be speaking with the Sea Kings!

143
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,760
I can't believe it!

144
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,870
Several Sea Kings
suddenly appeared outside of Fishman Island.

145
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,730
Almost as if to stop Luffy-san from destroying the Noah.

146
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,810
They came to protect it.
That's what it looks like, at least.

147
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,650
Perhaps the Noah is somehow important to them?

148
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,430
Neptune-sama!

149
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,190
The Sea Kings.

150
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,650
So, it's finally awakened.

151
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,310
The power that could destroy the world itself.

152
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,380
Look.  The bubble is being absorbed by the island.

153
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,950
Humans can't survive on the ocean floor.

154
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,310
Go to him.

155
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,820
Luffy-sama!

156
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,740
This is awful!

157
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,500
Perhaps I was imagining it?

158
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,910
That human with the hat.  He heard our voices.

159
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,770
He couldn't have.

160
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,190
This happened before, a little while back.

161
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes, it did.

162
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,050
Rayleigh, did you hear that voice?!

163
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,370
What are you talking about?

164
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,560
We're in the complete silence of the deep sea.

165
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,060
Who's there?!  Who's talking so far underwater?!

166
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,810
Hey!  Show yourself!

167
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,980
I wonder why.

168
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,270
Why indeed.

169
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,380
S-Sea Kings?!

170
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,510
T-They're carrying the Noah!

171
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
They're gonna eat us!

172
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,800
The ship is badly damaged.

173
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,700
Can it be fixed?  Can it still still serve its purpose?

174
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,480
Who knows?

175
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,380
To fix it, we'd need the skills of that clan...

176
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,080
but times have changed.

177
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,720
Can it be fixed?

178
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,610
Hopefully it will be fixed...

179
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,020
before the promised time comes.

180
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,050
This is Ryuuguu Palace!  Come in, Left Minister!

181
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,450
We have an urgent report for you!

182
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,430
What happened?

183
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,750
The mermaids who were kidnapped...

184
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,730
have been found inside of the castle!

185
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,560
What?!  So, are they alright?!

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,350
Yes.  They're a little dazed,

187
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,730
but they say they can
remember the face of their captor clearly!

188
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,300
Unfortunately, the treasure room
was found empty at the same time.

189
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,090
There isn't anything left at all.

190
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,590
Of course, this includes
the national treasure, the Tamate Box!

191
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,960
Your Majesty!

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,340
It appears someone has robbed us
while we were away!

193
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,910
Never mind some petty thief stealing treasure.

194
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,720
We could have lost the entire country
just now -jamon.

195
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,660
More importantly,
tell everybody that the girls are safe.

196
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,210
It might be a little late, but we must show that the Straw Hats are innocent.

197
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
We've done something terrible.

198
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,300
If anyone tries to use bubbles to escape...

199
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,340
I'll shoot them down!

200
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,980
Dammit!

201
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,550
Have mercy, Boss!  Let us go!

202
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,100
I was just scared of Hody and his bunch!

203
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,880
We can go, right?!

204
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,540
We don't have anything to do with
the conflict on this island!  We're just humans!

205
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,530
This island depends on tourism and
the money it gets from human pirate visitors, right?!

206
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,570
Let us go!

207
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,760
I never said that we'd kill you.

208
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,420
Wait for the Neptune Royal Family's judgment.

209
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,300
This is an announcement for all citizens.

210
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,470
The Straw Hat Pirates...

211
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,110
had no involvement in the kidnapping of the mermaids.

212
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,290
We admit that we did not check the facts properly.

213
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,840
We truly regret it,
and would like to offer our sincerest apologies.

214
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,300
The Straw Hats didn't kidnap them after all.

215
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,830
I knew they couldn't have done it all along!

216
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,180
Don't lie!

217
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,970
We all thought that they were the culprits.

218
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,080
N-No, we believed in them, right?

219
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,590
S-Sure.

220
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,120
Liars!

221
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,180
Quiet!

222
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,490
You're being unfair!

223
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,020
Yeah!

224
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,750
We must admit it.

225
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,590
We doubted them...

226
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,160
We doubted them because they were human!

227
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,960
That's how it's always been.

228
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,310
We've always seen the humans as...

229
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,990
Super...

230
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,960
Afro!

231
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,220
Franky-san, that is quite stylish!

232
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,240
Super, isn't it?

233
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,720
I get completely worn out
whenever I use the Monster Point,

234
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,960
and I can't even walk for two or three hours.

235
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,600
But... I can still treat your wounds.

236
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,350
Is everyone alright?

237
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,460
You aren't alright.

238
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,920
Everyone seems fine.

239
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,630
Robin-chan!

240
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,470
I used my ultimate technique too, so I'm completely worn out!

241
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,470
Let me rest on your lap!

242
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,930
Pwease!

243
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,790
Just sleep on the ground.

244
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,170
No, you!

245
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,140
Luffy.

246
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,430
It's the Princes!

247
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,150
Hody?!

248
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,450
Vander Decken?!

249
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,160
Father, you must have been worried.

250
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,750
I'm just glad you're safe -jamon.

251
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,340
Everyone!  You can rest easy!

252
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,550
These men will no longer be allowed to run wild!

253
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,700
Now we can live without worrying!

254
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,860
I can't believe someone so scary
was in the Fishman District, so close to us.

255
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,610
C-Captain Hody!

256
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,090
He looks like a monster!

257
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,420
That's great!

258
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
Hey, isn't that...

259
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,590
He's back!

260
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,870
Luffy-san!

261
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,670
It's Straw Hat Luffy and Princess Shirahoshi!

262
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,370
Please, help him!

263
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,990
Luffy-sama won't stop bleeding!

264
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,310
Luffy-sama pushed himself too far for our sake.

265
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,360
Straw Hat.

266
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,180
This is awful!  I've got something to stop the bleeding in my backpack.

267
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,380
I'm counting on you, Robin.

268
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,650
Sure.

269
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm really worried about our next fight, Doc!

270
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,790
Right, I'm ready!

271
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,860
I'll move you.

272
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,160
That's a really freaky doctor!

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,950
A little to the left... the left...

274
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,780
Can you save Luffy-sama?!

275
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,500
I can stop the bleeding,
but he's already lost so much blood.

276
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,030
He doesn't have enough left!

277
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,050
What?!

278
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,650
Luffy's the only one in the crew with blood type F.

279
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,930
That's terrible!

280
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,510
There must be someone else with that blood type
here in the plaza!

281
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,280
Anyone!

282
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,690
Hey!

283
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,740
I... I've got F.

284
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,590
I have type F, but...

285
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,510
Daddy, you're type F, right?

286
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,890
Uh, well...

287
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,390
Oh, right!  This country has a law against donating blood to humans!

288
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,650
What kind of law is that?!  That's awful!

289
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,410
Please!  Luffy's in trouble!

290
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,940
My blood type is different, but it's still red!

291
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,210
Will that do?!

292
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,730
Uh, no.  I appreciate the sentiment, at least.

293
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,800
Princess Shirahoshi!

294
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,040
I know!  There are some human pirates here too!

295
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,210
Use my blood.

296
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,270
It's type F.  I'll give you as much as you need.

297
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,580
Jinbe!

298
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,560
Jinbe-chan!

299
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,850
But, the law...

300
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,060
I'm a pirate.

301
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,160
Boss!  What a relief!

302
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,180
Jinbe-san!

303
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,890
Thank you!

304
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,310
Jinbe, you-

305
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,090
It's fine -jamon.

306
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,480
Y-Your Majesty?

307
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,420
What's the problem?  Outdated laws...

308
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,090
are just curses.

309
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,040
Jinbe, this'll hurt a little.

310
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
I don't mind.

311
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,730
Even when you're hurt,

312
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,470
even when you're doing the hurting,

313
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,460
red blood flows through your veins.

314
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,960
This thin, tiny tube,

315
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,090
too small to be considered a path,

316
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,460
is what breaks through the prejudiced fear...

317
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,950
and the battles that tried to
wash away blood with more blood.

318
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,340
So easily it flows.

319
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,010
It is not some fleeting vision in the clouds,

320
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,980
but a clearly visible path that leads to the sun.

321
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,110
Jinbe.

322
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,830
Luffy-sama, you're awake!

323
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,990
Luffy!

324
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,700
Luffy!

325
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,670
What, you were conscious?

326
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,660
Straw Hat!

327
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,970
Luffy!

328
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,290
This is... our new beginning,

329
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,100
Mother!

330
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,160
Hey, Jinbe.

331
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,820
Join my crew!

332
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,230
The Royal Family has made its decision!

333
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,740
Alright!  We're free!

334
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,770
Serves you right, Hody!

335
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,740
I thought I'd live the rest of my days as a slave!

336
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,560
Straw Hat Pirates, we owe you one!

337
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,890
I'm gonna become the Pirate King!

338
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,040
Huh?!  I don't know about that...

339
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,360
Idiot!  I'm gonna do it!

340
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,720
We can finally go to the New World!

341
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,580
What if their grudge against Hody
turns into a grudge against Fishman Island?

342
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,500
That shouldn't change my decision.  This island
is a rest stop and tourism destination for pirates.

343
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,560
They didn't come here with ill intentions.

344
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,620
There is no reason for us to keep them -jamon.

345
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,050
Now then, as for the remaining members of
the New Fishman Pirates!

346
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,330
P-Please don't execute us!

347
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,810
S-Spare our lives!

348
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,360
We didn't know anything about Hody murdering the Queen!

349
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,180
They're all insane!

350
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,990
I sentence you...

351
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,030
to live here, on Fishman Island's mainland!

352
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,010
Whaaaaat?!

353
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,350
What?!  You mean to live under the law?!

354
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,120
That's fine by me.
It's better than being ruled by Hody.

355
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,750
You can't do that, Your Majesty!
We can't let these guys roam the streets freely.

356
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,430
We'll be scared to let our children out of the house!

357
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,930
Of course, they'll work under my army's command...

358
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,540
and will be pressed into service -jamon

359
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,890
I will give them jobs where
their formidable strength can be put to good use!

360
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,380
The Fishman District,
which we cannot watch effectively...

361
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,230
will be completely closed off
from this day forward -jamon!

362
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,850
The revelation of the true culprit
behind Queen Otohime's assassination...

363
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,570
has brought the darkness of fishmankind to light.

364
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,010
The Pirate Hody Jones's plot to conquer Fishman Island...

365
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,930
was, ironically, foiled by human pirates who had stopped at the island.

366
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,180
Hey.

367
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,230
Where is Straw Hat Luffy -jamon?

368
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,370
Well, you see... He ran away.

369
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,600
R-Ran away?!

370
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,560
May I ask why you all left the plaza,
as if you're trying to run away?

371
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,380
What a stupid thing to ask!

372
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,900
Back there, our fight was staged like a show for the citizens.

373
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,920
If we stayed in the plaza,
we might be made into some kind of heroes.

374
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,760
Just thinking about it makes me shudder.

375
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,440
You mean to say that
you don't wish to become heroes?

376
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,140
Listen up!  Heroes are the kind of people
who divide up and share their booze!

377
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,890
But I wanna drink all of it myself!

378
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,020
Again, where did you guys get this idea from?!

379
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,280
Why won't you join us, Jinbe?!

380
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,100
Let's go on adventures together!  Please!

381
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,410
Let's go out to sea!  It'll be fun!

382
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,600
Yeah, join our crew, Boss!

383
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,950
A former Warlord in our crew would be really reassuring!

384
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,500
And Luffy, you need to rest.  Don't get worked up. {originally: And it would make things safer for Luffy, too.}

385
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm only saying that I can't join you yet.

386
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm glad that you invited me.

387
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,950
I'm sure it would be fun
to travel the seas with all of you...

388
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,970
but there are still things I must do first.

389
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:01,240
Things that I am honor bound to do.
I've only taken a short break from those obligations.

390
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,090
I must still complete that journey.
Once I am able to move freely again...

391
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,230
I will come to meet up with you.  This I promise you.

392
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,370
If you still feel the same way when that time comes,

393
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,010
will you invite me to join once more,
Straw Hat Pirates?

394
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,240
This is a promise!

395
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,510
Hey, now... When a man is fulfilling his honor,
you shouldn't pressure him.

396
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,300
It seems Luffy's taken quite a liking to him.

397
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,480
A friend of Luffy's is a friend of ours!
We'll be waiting for you, Jinbe!

398
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,790
Thank you.

399
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,980
So, what now?

400
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,380
Do we just head straight for the New World?

401
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,040
Are you saying that you're leaving already?

402
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,410
I wanted to thank you properly,
and spend some more time with you.

403
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,400
Okay, then!  Let's spend at least a week in
the Mermaid Café before we leave!

404
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,990
You think we don't know
the real reason why you want to do that?!

405
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,260
Granted, I completely agree with you!

406
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,960
Hey!  Please, wait!

407
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,330
What?

408
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,660
Isn't that a soldier from the Neptune Army?

409
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,060
Please hold on, Straw Hats!

410
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,270
King Neptune, I've caught up with the ship.

411
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,890
Good.  Luffy-kun!

412
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,490
Why did you leave?

413
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,450
We still haven't thanked-

414
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,510
I don't wanna be a hero!

415
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,540
I understand that.
I just wanted to invite you to a feast!

416
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,410
Let us resume the feast
that was interrupted before -jamon!

417
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,830
A feast?!

418
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,370
Alright!  Let's go call Hachi, Caimie and the others too!

419
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,120
On Neptune's orders,
the Fishman District was immediately sealed.

420
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,320
Hody, as well as the New Fishman Pirates' commanders and Vander Decken,

421
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,120
were all locked away in the prison tower.

422
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,030
We're counting on you, Kraken!  Take him to a distant sea!

423
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,560
Wadatsumi, there's no cell big enough for you!

424
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,130
You are banished from this kingdom!

425
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,810
Did you find any?

426
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,500
Yes!

427
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,850
Alright, let's cook 'em up
and bring 'em all to Ryuuguu Palace.

428
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,940
They've invited the Straw Hats to a huge feast.

429
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
We'll handle it!

430
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,280
We heard that sea monster meat is their favorite!

431
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,230
Let's bring them candy and cakes too!

432
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,050
I heard that they can eat a ton of food!

433
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,360
Bring everything you have!

434
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,440
Do we have enough alcohol?  We'll give 'em
so much top shelf liquor they could bathe in it!

435
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,080
Luffy-kun and his crew,
I'm glad you could come -jamon.

436
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,700
That being said, we can speak at the feast.

437
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,090
The long flounders will carry you to the banquet hall!

438
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,640
Whoa, those are some huge rays!

439
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,660
They're flounders.

440
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Don't you listen, Luffy?
He just said that they were flounders.

441
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,820
It's a pitch-black, flooded room...

442
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,210
I never thought someone like me
would see Ryuuguu Palace.  I'm so nervous.

443
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,590
This is the first time I've been in Ryuuguu Palace.

444
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,780
Where are we?  Where's the meat and feast?

445
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,350
Oh!  Our heroes have arrived!

446
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,010
The floor's covered with soldiers!

447
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,690
Heroes!  Heroes!  Heroes!

448
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,750
Shut up!  Quit saying we're heroes!

449
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm eating all the meat!

450
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,100
That's right!  I wanna drink all the booze!

451
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,270
You're both hopeless.

452
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,100
Luffy-sama, the stage is right ahead!

453
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,960
Stage?

454
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,310
First off, let me introduce the pride of Fishman Island, the number one diva on the ocean floor...

455
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,350
Maria Napole!

456
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,940
And the Swing Jazz Orchestra!

457
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,480
What an amazing singing voice! {Eh, I've heard better. Oh, and for the record, the song lyrics are not included in the CCs and are just about unintelligible... So no subtitles for u.}

458
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,600
Maria-sama! {not sure what he's saying before "Maria-sama" --Fadeout4}

459
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,620
My soul is trembling!  Oh yeah!

460
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,780
And our special guests!

461
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,300
N-No way!

462
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,640
Men are left breathless by their beauty!

463
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,100
The Mermaid Café Dancers!

464
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,700
Stop that!

465
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,950
You'll die, Sanji!

466
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,380
Beauty too pure to be captured by a mere picture!
These ladies are number one!

467
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,710
My powuh ith fadibg...

468
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
Oh, my.

469
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,680
Awesome!

470
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,770
Simply spellbinding!

471
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,960
Caimie!

472
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,910
Ishilly!  You're alright!

473
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,500
Finally!  Can't have a feast without this!

474
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,360
I've been super-waiting for this!

475
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,110
I'd expect no less from Ryuuguu Palace!

476
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,000
Thank you very much.

477
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,680
Most obliged.

478
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,950
Thank you.

479
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,900
Mermaid-chaaaan!

480
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,940
Thank you very much.

481
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,010
Cheers!

482
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,520
Now, let's start drinking!

483
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,890
Yummy!

484
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,350
You can have as much as you like.

485
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,280
Oh, I'm done for!

486
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
Sanji!

487
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
You should be more careful, sir.

488
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,640
Father!

489
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,800
Shirahoshi.

490
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,550
Cheers!

491
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,410
Cheers -jamon!  It's alright -jamon!

492
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,160
You guys too!  Cheers!

493
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,260
Cheers!

494
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,750
This drink is quite delicious.
Is it made using different water?

495
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,880
Oh, so you can tell the difference, Miss?

496
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,700
Refill!

497
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,060
What's with the pale faces?  My cup's empty!

498
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,560
W-We lose.

499
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,670
Akkamanbo!  Fuuri!  Fuuri!

500
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,190
Keep dancing, everyone!

501
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,930
Eat, drink, and let loose -mi fa so la ti do!

502
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,150
What did you want to talk about -jamon,

503
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,050
Pirate girl?

504
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,280
Forgive me.  I thought this would be
our best chance to be alone.

505
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,000
I-I should make this clear, I have sworn to love nobody but my wife, Otohime, for the rest of my life!

506
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,840
She might be dead now, but I could never betray-

507
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,660
Who is Joyboy?

508
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,140
I read a Poneglyph in the Sea Forest.

509
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,090
Who was he apologizing to?

510
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,340
You can read them?!

511
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm a survivor from Ohara.
If you don't want to tell me, I won't force you.

512
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,030
No.

513
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,620
I'll tell you all that I know.

514
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,090
I'm okay with you knowing.

515
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:04,180
Joyboy was a man from the surface, who lived during the void century.

516
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,640
So he died at least eight hundred years ago?

517
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,610
That message was directed to the Mermaid Princess
who had lived on this island.

518
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,070
It was an apology,
because he'd broken a promise to Fishman Island. {THAT FOREHEAD! O_O --Fadeout4}

519
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,010
Promise?

520
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,180
The details haven't been passed down,

521
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,840
but eventually somebody will come and carry out the promise in Joyboy's place.

522
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,550
That is the legend that is passed down
through the Royal Family.

523
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,540
We promised to believe in that day,

524
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,580
and each generation has taken its turn to watch over the Noah, as promised.

525
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:49,810
When that day comes,
the Noah will fulfill its mission, at last.

526
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,040
Earlier today,
after everything was finished above the island,

527
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,310
I heard that the half-destroyed Noah was carried into the Sea Forest...

528
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,520
by the Sea Kings.

529
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:07,440
Maybe Joyboy, who was going to use the Noah, had the power to control the Sea Kings?

530
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,480
No, it was the former Mermaid Princess
who had that power.

531
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,220
I knew it.
So, does Princess Shirahoshi have the same power?

532
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:24,410
Yes.  I assume that it awakened completely today.

533
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,560
I can't say I'm happy about this.

534
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,380
I understand.

535
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:46,410
Two years ago, I read a Poneglyph on Sky Island
that told the location of an ancient weapon.

536
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,740
It said that it was here, on this island.

537
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,880
The Mermaid Princess
who lived in the same era as Joyboy...

538
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,320
Is this what they called her, perhaps?

539
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,260
Or in other words, Princess Shirahoshi, who carries the same power...

540
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,430
will also inherit this title.

541
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:16,490
Her other name is...

542
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,620
the ancient weapon...{ Btwb: split this line since there is quite a big pause and it adds dramatic effect }

543
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,720
Poseidon!
