00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,340
Once there was a man who obtained everything, the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,640
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,380
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,870
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,320
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,820
Dawn can't come soon enough, I'm tired of waiting!

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,490
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,070
Now raise our flag to the Break of Romance Dawn.

Freedom is our only rule!

Forget our worries, just let the wind blow.

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm sure we'll be the first to find One Piece!

so let's never wake them up.

One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,720
We... made it this far.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,620
We'll go... wherever our dreams take us,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
and we won't leave anyone behind.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,300
We'll go at it with all our hearts, that's a vow.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
On that day when our dreams began,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,720
we set our goals and they've never changed!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't stay still! I can't stop!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610
The sun in my heart will never set!

One, two, Sunshine...

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,820
One, two, Sunshine, four... We Go!

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,030
We Go!

Invited to Ryuuguu Palace!

Quiet... Be quiet!

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,680
Now's our chance!  Hurry and get aboard the ship!

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,250
Everyone grab an oar, and prepare to get going!

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,670
The Fishman District 
 "Noah"

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,930
Hurry!  Hurry!

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,690
They could come chasing after us at any moment!

50
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,360
We can't stay on Fishman Island any longer.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,910
We have to get past the Red Line, quickly!

52
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,180
Damn it!  I really wanted to see the Mermaid Café!

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,370
You'll have to give up on that, idiots!  Now stop talking and row!

54
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,200
Honestly... I can't believe this!

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,100
The Kraken was sleeping on the ocean floor,
so we managed to avoid it...

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,550
and we made it down 10 kilometers.

57
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:27,120
Pirate from South Blue
 Crab-Hand Gyro

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,120
Bounty: 73,000,000 belly.

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,400
Then all those sea monsters surrounded us...

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
and we couldn't even fight back!

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,620
Join the fishmen or die?!

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,440
At that time, we didn't have any choice
but to join them!

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,960
We're moving farther and farther away
from the Mermaid Café.

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,810
Quit your crying!  Keep moving, men!

65
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,520
We'll be lucky if we escape with our lives!

66
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,260
Huh?  They ran away?

67
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,240
That's right, Boss.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,580
{\an8}So they ran away again -dosun?
They never learn, do they -dosun?

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,580
Member of the New Fishman Pirates
 Dosun (Hammerhead Shark Fishman)

70
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,450
Member of the New Fishman Pirates
 Zeo (Wobbegong Fishman)

71
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,450
{\an8}Humans run away all the time.

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,420
{\an8}Maybe I should just tear them apart?

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,420
Member of the New Fishman Pirates
 Daruma (Cookiecutter Shark Fishman)

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
It's fine.

75
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,400
We can use them to set another example.

76
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,430
Captain of the New Fishman Pirates 
 Hody Jones

77

Member of the New Fishman Pirates 
 Ikaros Much (Giant Squid Fishman)

79
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,850
{\an8}In that case, should I take a shot at them -hi?

80
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,230
{\an8}Not necessary, Ikaros.

81
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,270
Muhi, understood.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,570
I'll go myself.

83
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,230
Huh?!

84
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Prepare a bubble.

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,360
You can't take that many power drug pills all at once!

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,770
Alright, we're here!

87
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,920
This is my house!

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,690
It's huge!

89
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,310
Welcome home, Master!

90
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh my!  It's Monsieur Pappagg!

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,390
Amazing!  Is it really him?

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah, I bet you're surprised now!

93
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Out at sea, I'm nothing more than a stylish starfish.

94
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,610
But here on Fishman Island,
I am the president of the Criminal clothing brand.

95
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,800
A super-popular celebrity designer!

96
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,830
My brand is known all over the world,

97
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,950
and it's sold in stores in every country! {Gil: Maybe "worldwide" or something?}{ def: we had "all over the world" last line.  maybe reverse: "My brand is known in every counrty, and it's sold in stores worldwide!" }

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,420
Even the famous Doskoi Panda-

99
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,200
Oh, look over there!  What's that?

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,330
The Criminal Store is on the first floor.

101
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,610
Really?  Let's go have a look!

102
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,450
Caimie... Caimie...

103
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,370
Sure!

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,660
Hey!

105
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,660
Won't you listen... to my story...

106
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,420
{\an8}Wait, dear customer, you're being unreasonable!

107
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,660
{\an8}This is a very high-class brand we're selling here.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
What's going on?

109
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,930
It sounds like the shopkeeper has a problem.

110
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,050
Perhaps someone's complaining?

111
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,640
Like I said, your prices are too high!  Though the clothes are cute.

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,800
That voice...

113
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,550
Alright, drop the price to 10,000 belly.

114
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't do that, dear customer!
That's less than half the original price!

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,130
I knew it was her.  That complainer.

116
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,840
Hey, Nami!

117
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,630
Luffy!

118
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,630
Nami-chin!

119
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,970
Caimie!

120
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,950
Oh, Monsieur Pappagg, perfect timing.

121
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,560
We have a somewhat difficult customer here...

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,270
Oh!

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Wait, you mean this is your store?

124
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,040
What's with the high prices?  Are you trying to rip me off?!

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,550
Monsieur!

126
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,800
Well, the brand's expensive.
I'm a popular designer, after all...

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,970
Give me a discount!

128
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,090
No, wait!

129
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,720
Don't be so hostile!

130
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,360
I owe you guys a lot for what you did two years ago!

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,680
You can have it for free!  Take whatever you like!

132
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,920
For free?  Really?!

133
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Monsieur!  They emptied the whole store!

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,040
You really did go all out!

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,490
How nice for you.

136
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,420
Hmm?  What could that be?

137
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,410
There's a lot of noise coming from outside.

138
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Monsieur!  Big news!

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,720
What is it?

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,050
H-He is here!

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,120
Why is he here?

142
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,590
That's...

143
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,090
Look up at the sky!

144
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,760
He's come down from the royal palace!

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,740
Jamon!  Jamon!

146
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,740
What's that?  A whale?

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Why would he come to these lowly waters?

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,680
This is the first time I've seen him in person!

149
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,310
What's going on?  He doesn't even have an escort!

150
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,180
Unbelievable!  He decided to just suddenly come down here on his own?!

151
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,720
Maybe there's some kind of national crisis?!

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,170
Ruler of the Ryuuguu Kingdom
 Sea God Neptune

153

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,170
Neptune.

155
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,200
Hoe 
 (His Beloved Whale)

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,900
That's one huge merman!

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,370
I much prefer the mermaids.

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,650
Hey, you guys!

159
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,680
What a shaggy old guy!

160
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm telling you, you're being rude!

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,590
Kneel before him already!

162
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,080
That whale is so cute!

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,250
Does he have business with those humans? {Gil: Those humans?}

164
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,160
Hey, Megalo.  You're sure it's these people -jamon?

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,500
Huh?  Didn't we meet that shark on the way here?

166
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Hey, human with the straw hat, and his friends.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,700
I have come...

168
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,740
to take you...

169
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,960
to see the Ryuuguu Palace -jamon!

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,700
Whaaat?!

171
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,610
R-R-R-R-R-Ryuuguu Palace?!

172
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Ryuuguu Palace?

173
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,720
Near the Fishman District "Noah"
The depths

174
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,020
{\an8}Hurry! Row Faster!

175
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,720
{\an8}Or else they'll spot us!

176
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,090
We're caught in a deep sea current!  This is tough!

177
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200
This is why we should've
had a paddle installed on the ship!

178
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,200
Do you realize how brutal the New World is?!

179
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,810
Captain, look!

180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,210
There's something ahead of us!

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,840
Hody Jones!

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,300
N-No way!  He found us!

183
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,580
Huh?  He's...

184
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,580
What's that?  He's wearing handcuffs! { def: shackles? }

185
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,480
He disappeared!

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,230
Where did that damn bastard go?!

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
He pierced through the hull!

188
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,040
Take him down!  There's only one enemy!

189
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,500
I've fought against fishmen before.

190
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,270
How many trials do you think I've overcome to get this far?!

191
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,940
You're just a fish!
Don't underestimate humans, you fool!

192
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,530
Captain!

193
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,620
Damn it!

194
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,360
Man, this is a nasty thing we've gotten hold of -hi.

195
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,270
The power drugs... Energy Steroids.

196
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,950
A fishman's inherent physical strength is ten times that of a regular human.

197
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,420
However, your power is doubled again if you take a single Energy Steroid pill.

198
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,550
Twenty times the strength of a human.

199
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,340
Taking two of them multiplies it again!

200
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,300
The price for this dreamlike power is that it shortens your lifespan.

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,220
However, we will accept an early death in exchange for furthering our cause!

202
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,320
W-What is that bastard doing?!

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,100
What is he planning to do with the mast?!

204
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
Now I understand why he's wearing handcuffs!

205
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,090
He's showing us that he
doesn't even need his hands to sink us!

206
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,000
The life of Fisher Tiger was taken by humans!
The will of Arlong, too!

207
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,990
Our generation will end
Fishman Island's dark history of oppression!

208
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,330
We, the New Fishman Pirates, will end it!

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,510
Float into the New World.

210
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,830
Oh, goodness... You didn't kill them all, did you?

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,170
No, I need them alive.

212
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,900
Live with those wounds and show the world above...

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,770
what happened to you here beneath the sea!

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,560
Tell them who you met!

215
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,060
Tell the humans on dry land about our terror!

216
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,460
We will take the center of the world, Fishman Island,

217
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,020
from that pathetic Sea God, Neptune,

218
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,360
and drag you humans into the dark depths of the sea!

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,830
We'll teach you all that fishmen are the superior species!

220
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,390
A few hours ago...

221
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,870
Ryuuguu Kingdom, the Mermaids' Cove. {Yeah, the caption and narration say the exact same thing. Pretty unnecessary, huh?}

222
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,940
This thing is so tightly sealed.

223
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,100
I wonder what's inside it?

224
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,560
This would be some sort of chest if it was treasure.

225
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,890
Since it's just a barrel,
maybe it's filled with some high-class liquor? { def: tlced from manga }

226
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,880
It's... so hard... to open!

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,110
Oh, that's quite enough.

228
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,690
Opening it up this much is more than sufficient!

229
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,740
What?!  There was someone inside of it?!

230
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,320
No way!

231
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,350
Thanks a ton!

232
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,870
I'm really grateful, my dear mermaids!

233
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,390
Don't try to run away, now!

234
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,590
Quick!  Into the water!

235
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,010
It's too late for that!

236
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm... sinking...

237
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,650
It's a swamp!
How'd it get in this rocky area?! {Gil: Only just on the screen long enough for me to read. A good way of shortening the line isn't coming to mind right now...}

238
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,390
You can't break free from this bog!

239
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,070
It's bottomless!

240
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,320
I'm a Devil Fruit User.
A swamp-man, who ate the Swamp Fruit!

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,190
The more you struggle...

242
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,860
No!

243
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,940
...the faster you sink!

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,100
Help!

245
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,340
Please, don't scream.  I'm not gonna kill you.

246
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,150
Somebody-

247
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,550
Didn't I just tell you not to do that, you idiot?!

248
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,700
Ishilly!

249
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,930
I just need you to go to sleep for a little while!

250
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,710
My body is bottomless...

251
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,460
How much do they pay for mermaids again?

252
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,800
I seem to recall the starting price at auction being 70,000,000 for one of them.

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,140
So with three, that's...

254
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,650
I owe the Straw Hats one for this!

255
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,700
Thanks to them, I was able to enter Fishman Island without registering...

256
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
And I can hunt high-class mermaids freely!

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,750
This place is a treasure island!

258
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,570
Ryuuguu Kingdom Port Town
 "Coral Hill"

259
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,570
{\an8}The Straw Hat Pirates? {Gil: Originally "The crew of the pirate Straw Hat?" but that sounds way awkward to me.}

260
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,530
Were they the ones who kidnapped the girls from the Mermaids' Cove?

261
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,570
No, I didn't say that.

262
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,650
They seemed like nice people...

263
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,570
And besides, they're Caimie's friends.

264
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,270
They may have threatened her.

265
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,100
No way.

266
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,940
If we look at the facts,
the only ones who were there at the time...

267
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,470
were us guards, the girls,

268
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,130
the gang from the Fishman District who were beaten...

269
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,470
and the Straw Hats.

270
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,570
And we have nobody who can attest to what they were up to after they disappeared.

271
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,600
Humans always have a reason to kidnap mermaids.

272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,930
In human society, young mermaids are sold at high prices.

273
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,390
Even so, you can't just accuse them based on guesswork.

274
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:17,380
Do you have any idea how many humans have put up a nice front, then kidnapped mermaids in the past?!

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
Prince Fukaboshi. { def: i never get used to people just randomly saying someone's name }

276
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,860
And Madame Shyarly,
about what you were saying earlier...

277
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,270
Did you really see a future like that?

278
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,940
That the pirate Straw Hat Luffy
is going to destroy Fishman Island?

279
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,880
Madame Shyarly, have some water.

280
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,630
Yes, I saw it.

281
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,190
That is what I saw, no doubt about it.

282
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,260
Even we at Ryuuguu Palace have heard how accurate your predictions are.

283
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,100
This is quite a dilemma.

284
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,240
We were going to thank them for saving our sister's pet.

285
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,710
But now, even if this prediction is unconfirmed, we can't just let them roam free.

286
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,430
We need to capture them.

287
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,570
Ryuuguu Kingdom
 Elite District: "Gyoverly Hills"

288
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,570
{\an8}They're gone...

289
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,500
Who were they, anyway?

290
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,060
To think that King Neptune would personally invite them to the Ryuuguu Palace.

291
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,790
Don't fall off!

292
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,970
Neptune!

293
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,830
What's wrong with you, old geezer?

294
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,910
Those yells are ridiculous.

295
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
Quit being so rude!

296
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,990
Straw, you're scary!  You're honestly scaring me!

297
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,040
That shark there, Megalo...

298
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,960
He's my daughter's pet,
and she cares a lot about him -jamon.

299
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,190
When Megalo didn't come back, she wouldn't stop crying.

300
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,700
{\an8}So he'd been attacked by the Kraken...

301
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,660
Megalo (The Mermaid Princess' Beloved Shark)

302
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,710
{\an8}That was really dangerous,
and I'm thankful that you saved him -jamon.

303
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,470
Well, it was just a coincidence,
but yeah, good thing we managed to save him.

304
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,050
So he's the Mermaid Princess' pet?

305
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,910
Oh?  Pappagg-san, did you not once say that
you and the Mermaid Princess were best friends?

306
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,920
Oh, so that was a lie?

307
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,550
I-Is it really alright?

308
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,750
For us to come along to the Ryuuguu Palace.

309
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,630
He did say "Your friends are quite welcome too -jamon", so what's the problem?

310
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,990
To tell you the truth, I sent my sons out to fetch you,
but they still haven't returned -jamon.

311
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,840
So I decided to go myself.

312
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,500
After all, I too am looking forward to the feast, and wish to start eating soon -jamon!

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,670
Ah, I forgot to mention, but one of your friends
has already been taken there.

314
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,480
Huh?

315
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,400
He's a swordsman.  He began drinking already.

316
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,450
These feasts are more fun if everyone's there.
What a selfish man.

317
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,460
I believe his name was...

318
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,030
Zoro, huh?

319
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,430
That's Zoro, alright.

320
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,700
Zori! {Let's make that his offical name! -FAb} {Gil: Better than "Zolo"}

321
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,270
It's Zoro!

322
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,910
The guards are looking for your companions and will invite them all to the castle, so don't worry -jamon.

323
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,020
Nami, do you know where they went?

324
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,090
With this many people around, I might be able to find information sooner than I'd thought.

325
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,120
Huh?

326
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,530
I'm most curious about where I can find the relatives
of my shipwright master.

327
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,620
This is Tom-san's homeland.

328
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,570
I have some things I want to investigate as well.

329
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,930
You too?

330
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,670
Since ancient times, Fishman Island has been an island rich with folklore.

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,070
I'm sure another one lies here...

332
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,500
A valuable fragment of history.

333
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,850
So we split up again.

334
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,660
You haven't had any trouble, right?

335
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,600
Well, you could say we have,
and you could say we haven't...

336
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,280
By the way, old man. {Kijou: the word Nami uses for Neptune is, rather than 'old man', endearing. It's what you'd use for your grandad or someone similar to that position. It's a very friendly (but very casual) term. So 'gramps' or something similar would probably suit better, since at least to me 'old man' sounds a bit rude.} { def: gramps works for me, so long as this isn't the same word that Luffy uses when we say "old man" }

337
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,060
That's the Sea God, Neptune-sama you're talking to!

338
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,340
We're ten thousand meters under the sea, so
why is it so bright in the area around Fishman Island?

339
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,180
It's not that the area surrounding Fishman Island is bright.

340
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,740
This is the only place on the ocean floor where the sun shines, so fishmen started living here long ago.

341
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,750
That's how Fishman Island was founded.

342
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,610
The roots of the Treasure Tree, Eve,
reach down to these depths.

343
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,090
They transfer sunlight directly from the surface
to the bottom of the sea.

344
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,470
Transfer sunlight?

345
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,180
So you are saying this tree has glowing roots
that reach ten thousand meters below the sea?

346
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,140
Indeed.  The scientists keep making new theories for how this can be,

347
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,980
but it is a mysterious tree that receives light at the surface and emits it from its roots -jamon. {Oh look, Neptune has taken a page out of the Monkey D. Luffy-book of explaining supernatural phenomena.}

348
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,380
And its respiration supplies air to the sea floor as well.

349
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,370
So it's like the big boss of the
Yarukiman Mangroves on Sabaody?

350
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,100
Hey, shaggy old guy, I'm hungry!

351
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,520
Hey you!

352
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,960
We are almost there.

353
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,400
That is the entrance -jamon.

354
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,600
Ding-dong.

355
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,560
Yes?

356
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,840
It's me -jamon.

357
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
That phrase... Y-Your Majesty!

358
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,920
I will lower the path for you immediately!

359
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,470
Keep your bubbles on tight -jamon.

360
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,160
Now, let us go.

361
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,150
Neptune! {Gil: Yes, we know your name . Can you please shut the hell up now?}

362
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm really looking forward to getting to the Ryuuguu Palace!

363
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,990
Here we are -jamon.

364
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,370
Royal Palace of the Ryuuguu Kingdom 
 Ryuuguu Palace

365
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,560
Amazing!  This is so cool!

366
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,900
It makes Pappagg-san's mansion look as small as a flea.

367
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,810
Don't compare them!

368
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,320
What a beautiful castle!

369
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,030
King Neptune has returned!

370
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,280
I was wondering where he'd gone.

371
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,740
Open the gate!

372
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,570
Opening the gate!

373
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,830
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

374
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,960
This castle looks like a lot of fun!

375
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,850
It is my palace -jamon!  Make yourselves at home!

376
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,870
For crying out loud!  You did it again!

377
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,950
You just went into the kingdom on your own without considering your position again!

378
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,570
You can't just go down to the surface without even bringing an escort!

379
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,870
What are we to do?

380
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,630
I will be more careful in the future -jamon.

381
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,070
He got scolded.

382
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
If something happened to you, it'd be too late for apologies!

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,300
Do you even realize the situation our country is in?!

384
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,960
Never mind all that, look!

385
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,690
I have brought the people who saved Megalo
when he was being bullied by the Kraken -jamon!

386
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,290
Now, welcome our guests!

387
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,460
Uh, what is Princess Shirahoshi doing?

388
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,860
Well, Your Majesty, it seems to have happened again...

389
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,980
What?!  This is all because you didn't
watch over the princess to keep her calm!

390
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,440
You imbeciles!

391
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,070
And while that was going on...

392
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:56,660
you just disappeared without a trace!  Can't you see that you made everyone worry, Your Majesty?! {Gil: Split after "trace!"?} { def: drop "from the palace".  small sacrafice }

393
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,880
In the first place...

394
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,250
I promise I will be more careful in the future -jamon.

395
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,490
He got scolded again.

396
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,440
{\an8}I sincerely apologize for bringing this up when you've just brought guests here...

397
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,210
Ryuuguu Kingdom  Minister of the Right
 (Seahorse Merman)

398
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
{\an8}but we have important business to discuss.

399
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,970
{\an8}Yes, Prince Fukaboshi...

400
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,020
Ryuuguu Kingdom  Minister of the Left
 (Catfish Merman)

401
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,890
{\an8}contacted us just a moment ago.

402
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,700
{\an8}What are we to do?

403
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,040
Fukaboshi, you say?  What happened?!

404
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,610
You see...

405
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,790
I wonder how long they intend to ignore us?

406
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,590
Huh?  Where'd Luffy go?

407
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,240
He was just here!

408
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,290
He can't stay still even for a minute, can he?

409
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,120
What's he thinking, wandering around on God's land?!

410
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,860
Yep, it's this way...

411
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,400
The smell of tasty food!

412
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,160
Maybe this is where they're holding the feast?

413
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,650
They said Zoro was already here, didn't they?

414
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,650
Still, that is one huge, thick and solid-looking door!

415
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,090
The wall looks really sturdy too.
They're like the walls in Impel Down!

416
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,960
What kind of delicious food do they have inside?!

417
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,470
It's pitch black in here...
So this isn't where the feast is being held?

418
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,760
But they do have some food that smells really nice here!

419
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,070
So is this the food storage room, then?

420
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, whatever!  I'll have some!

421
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,290
My hunger is at its limit!

422
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,490
What's this?

423
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,890
There are corals wherever I go on this island, huh?

424
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,800
What's this?  It's so soft...

425
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,630
Huh?  Was that someone's voice?

426
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,690
This coral feels like pudding!

427
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,140
Is somebody there?!

428
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,120
What is it?!

429
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,590
What are you doing on someone else's body?!

430
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,140
{\an8}Who might you be?!

431
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,750
Princess of the Ryuuguu Kingdom
 Princess Shirahoshi (Giant Whiting Mermaid)

432
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,340
What?!  It was a huge person... No, a mermaid?!

433
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Y-You've come to take my life too, haven't you?

434
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,150
B-But I'm not afraid of you!

435
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,340
After all, I'm the daughter of Neptune...

436
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,960
So I'm not...

437
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,690
I'm not...

438
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,270
Somebody!

439
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,960
Father!  Big brother!

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,350
H-Hey, hey... I didn't do anything!

441
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,520
Seriously, what is wrong with you?!
