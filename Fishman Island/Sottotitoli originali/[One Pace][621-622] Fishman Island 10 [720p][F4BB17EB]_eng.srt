1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,390
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,940
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,660
All my wealth and treasure?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,300
It can be yours if you want!

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,450
Search for it!

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,820
I left everything in that one place.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,850
People now set sail in search of romance.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,430
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,910
Outta my way!

11
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,230
I've been robbed!

12
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,190
Somebody, please stop him!

13
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,180
He's stolen a lot of money!

14
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,310
Hey, move it!

15
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,990
I-If you come too close,
I can't guarantee this girl's safety!

16
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,750
Your Majesty?

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,870
Oh, Your Majesty!  Please wait!

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,110
You mustn't keep involving yourself in these things!

19
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,570
That is our job!

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,310
Please wait, Queen Otohime!

21
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,180
Who's that?

22
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,980
Stay away!  Or I'll shoot!

23
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,310
I... I warned you!

24
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,830
Did I miss?!

25
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,640
Damn it!  Stay away!

26
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,480
Is that... Otohime-sama?

27
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,900
It hurts!

28
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,490
That's the problem here?!

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,210
My hand!

30
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,990
Doctor!

31
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,200
Your Majesty!  Let me have a look.

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,910
It's a compound fracture.

33
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,850
From a single punch?

34
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,510
I do not care.

35
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,400
Q-Queen Otohime...

36
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,900
{\an5}Otohime, Fisher Tiger, and the Sun Pirates!
The Fateful Encounter!

37
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,800
The Queen...

38
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,930
Why would you commit such a vile act as robbery?!

39
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,930
Shut up!  What would you wealthy royals know?!

40
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,530
I've got ten kids at home,
and all of them crying because they're so hungry!

41
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,730
That just makes it worse!

42
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,280
Y-Your Majesty!  Please, stop hitting him.

43
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,950
You know your body is much weaker than the average person's!

44
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,730
I do not care!  This is for his own good!

45
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,610
Even if my hands are destroyed, I must make him understand!

46
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,660
Do you think that children raised on stolen money
can ever be truly happy?!

47
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,240
A man should live a life that
his children can be proud of!

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,030
However...

49
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,560
I wish to... apologize as well.

50
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm so sorry!

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,150
I am your Queen...

52
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,710
yet I did not see your suffering,
even though we live in the same kingdom.

53
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,550
The pain that you feel in your heart...

54
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,970
also pierces through my heart.

55
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,640
The hardship you've faced must have been terrible.

56
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,670
I... didn't want to do it either!

57
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,600
But I didn't have any other choice!

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,810
My store caught fire...
Someone burned it down and stole all my money!

59
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,870
I don't have a job, and my debt is terrible.

60
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,120
My kids are famished and I feel so sorry for them!

61
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,990
So that's why.

62
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,910
I understand.  I understand completely.

63
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,150
But it was still wrong!

64
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,180
Whaaaat?!

65
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,940
If you do the same thing that was done to you, you'll just continue the chain of misfortune!

66
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm sorry!

67
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,810
Even so, please forgive me!

68
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,790
We could not be there for you so the blame lies with us too!

69
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,260
No, you're too kind.

70
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,010
I don't deserve such kind words.

71
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,880
But it was still wrong!

72
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,450
I'm sorry!

73
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,270
But it was still wrong!

74
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,950
I promise, I will change my ways!

75
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,540
Thank you for crying for someone like me!

76
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,190
Your Majesty!

77
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,350
That is wonderful!  Please, do your best!

78
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,630
It's exceptional just to have the royal family
leave Ryuuguu Palace and walk around the kingdom.

79
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,920
But for the sake of a single citizen,
she's willing to shed tears and slap him.

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,450
Otohime-sama truly is an unusual queen!

81
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,430
Truly a loving person.
Look!  Even the children adore her!

82
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,300
Otohime-sama!

83
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,910
I do this all for the sake of you children.

84
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,690
Whaaaat?!

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,850
Your nose is running.
For your sake, I had to slap you!

86
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,140
You look like a fool,
with snot running out of one nostril.

87
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,050
If your nose is going to run,
it should run out of both nostrils.

88
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,250
It's so touching!

89
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,610
Is it?

90
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,070
A passionately loving person.

91
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,050
Queen Otohime would come down from Ryuuguu Palace every day,

92
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,630
and appeal to the citizens of the kingdom.

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,670
We must bring Ryuuguu Kingdom up to the surface!

94
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,860
"The color of their skin is different.
So is the shape of their bodies."

95
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,680
We should not wait for the humans,
who think like that, to understand us.

96
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,430
Instead, we should approach them ourselves and learn about their ways!

97
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,270
There are ten thousand meters between the sea floor and the surface.

98
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,660
The same distance separates
the humans' way of thinking and our own.

99
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,300
Do not misunderstand!

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,910
The humans who come to this island
are a certain type of humans called pirates.

101
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,790
And the ones who buy people from slave traders are an elite minority called Nobles.

102
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,410
We are biased because we only come into contact
with certain kinds of humans.

103
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,330
We still do not know anything about them.

104
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,550
Certainly, there must be many kind-hearted humans up on the surface as well!

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,060
We will bring our kingdom up there,
so that we may live together under the same sun!

106
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,500
At this year's world council meeting,
let us express our wish to emigrate into their world!

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,610
All of you, please sign this petition.

108
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,060
I don't know...
Even if it's you asking, Queen Otohime.

109
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,580
Compromising with the humans.  I just don't know.

110
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,680
You should not say that.

111
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,550
Rather than never trying because we think it
can't be done, we should take the first step ourselves!

112
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,660
Now, then!

113
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,940
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,840
It's no use.  History has already given its answer.

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,850
I'm back, children.

116
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,360
Welcome home, Mother!

117
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,070
I'm back, Shirahoshi.

118
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,230
Ah, Shirahoshi, my oasis of peace.

119
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,020
I am sorry for being late.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,550
My, you have snot hanging out of your nose,
and yet you are still so cute.

121
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,620
We were with her the whole time, so she's alright, Mother!

122
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,230
She's alright, she's alright!

123
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,060
Thank you, my dear princes.

124
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,050
Mother, is your hand alright?

125
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,110
Oh, this is nothing to worry about.

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,830
Your mother will change the future you will live in!

127
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,380
If Her Majesty wants to give a speech,
she should just do a video broadcast.

128
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,080
It's because of Kenbunshoku Haki that she was born with -jamon.

129
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,540
She doesn't want to talk from a palace up in the sky,

130
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,800
but to face them directly,
close enough to feel their hearts.

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
That is what Otohime believes is right.
Even I cannot stop her.

132
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,120
But there are so many human pirates on the island.

133
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,740
Even if we're being protected by
the authority of your friend, the pirate Whitebeard,

134
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,190
you never know what might happen.

135
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,200
She's aware of that.

136
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:26,840
The world that Otohime dreams of
is an ambition from several hundred years ago.

137
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,470
Our distant ancestors had the same dream,
but they were never able to realize it during their time.

138
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
What do you mean?!

139
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,600
I cannot stop Otohime.

140
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
Make sure to protect her for me.

141
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
Yes, Sir!

142
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,630
This Otohime-san was
a pretty strange person, wasn't she?

143
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,090
You cry all the time...
Is that something you got from your mother?

144
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,430
Well... W-Who knows.

145
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,100
So you were a soldier in this country?

146
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,770
It was pretty much the only option I had, growing up in the Fishman District and only knowing how to fight.

147
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,690
The Fishman District?

148
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,940
Hachi, isn't that where you're from, too?

149
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,360
It sounds like a kind of scary place.

150
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,050
Indeed... Though in the past,

151
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,980
it used to be a giant orphanage that
took care of the children that didn't have relatives.

152
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,840
But before long, the inhabitants began to fight and
it became too much for the administration to handle.

153
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,170
It has turned into a lawless zone where
all the outcasts from Fishman Island gather.

154
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,490
The man who used to be
the leader of the Fishman District, Fisher Tiger,

155
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,990
eventually left the country to go on an adventure.

156
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,280
And I, who was supposed to succeed him,
joined the royal army.

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,460
The Macro Crew, despite being fishmen,
went on to become slave traders themselves.

158
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,500
And the others...

159
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,780
They all went their own separate ways.

160
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,620
And then, one day...

161
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,160
Please, give it back!

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,170
If you want it back, then why don't you try taking it?

163
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,720
Give it back!

164
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,400
Do you have any idea how many signatures there are on those sheets?!

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,310
Why should I care how many signatures there are?!

166
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,600
Hey, stop right there!
You're Arlong from the Fishman District, aren't you?!

167
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,710
Arlong from the Fishman District?

168
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,640
L-Let me go!

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,590
That's not quite right.

170
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm Captain Arlong, of the Arlong Pirates!

171
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,170
I live by hunting those inferior pirates...

172
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,110
who have the run of this place
even though they can't breathe underwater.

173
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,170
I'm hunting down pirates in your place!

174
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,270
The Neptune Army should pay me to show their gratitude!

175
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,780
B-Boss Jinbe...
Don't just sit there and watch.  Help me!

176
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,190
Jinbe?

177
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:07,740
Ryuuguu Kingdom, Soldier in the Neptune Army
Jinbe, 30 years old

178
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,300
Hey, hoodlum.  Let go of that rookie!

179
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,830
He happens to be my underling.

180
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,180
Oh, and while I have no interest in
that paper with the signatures on it,

181
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,130
it's really important to the Queen.  So give it back!

182
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,610
It's Boss Jinbe from the Neptune Army!

183
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,340
We're saved!

184
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,650
Boss, huh?  That's a good title for you!

185
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,640
You won't find another soldier
that acts more like a mafia boss, after all!

186
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,930
Do as I say, Arlong!

187
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,950
Fine, I got it.  Here.

188
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,520
Here you go!

189
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,730
Now, don't be so upset, Brother.

190
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,770
B-Brother?

191
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,660
Long time, no see.  We're comrades from the Fishman District, aren't we?

192
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,360
Don't lump me in with you.

193
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,790
You're still a pirate?  Scum!

194
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,820
Don't call me scum, Brother!

195
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,000
Then is trash better?

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,370
Trash?!

197
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,990
I thought of you like a brother,
but you still speak to me like that?

198
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,980
Hey, everyone!  It's Fisher Tiger-san, the adventurer!

199
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,430
Tiger-san has returned!

200
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,640
Tiger-san!

201
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,970
Tell us about your voyage!

202
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,400
Brother Ti!

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,470
Big Brother!

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,940
Jinbe, Arlong!  You look like you're doing well.

205
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,670
Your journey was quite long this time.

206
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,900
Yeah.  A lot of things happened.

207
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,940
Come to my ship!

208
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,200
Sure, later.  First of all,
I have some business at Ryuuguu Palace.

209
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,290
Then allow me to take you there.

210
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,410
Looks like he has no business with pirates.

211
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,500
What?!  Big Brother never said anything like that!

212
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,210
Try to get along, will you?

213
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,330
You want to free the slaves?

214
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,630
I can't take it anymore.

215
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,620
Being a slave is living hell.

216
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,740
Even now, as we speak, I'm sure they're being treated in utterly inhumane ways.

217
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,930
But still...

218
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,760
I've made up my mind.

219
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,080
You... What did you see on your latest voyage?

220
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,800
Humans.

221
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,080
And not long after that, a major incident occurred.

222
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
Big news!

223
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,250
What happened?

224
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,110
B-Boss Jinbe!

225
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,170
T-Tiger-san... attacked the Celestial Dragons!

226
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,440
The Celestial Dragons?!

227
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,720
Fisher Tiger attacked the Holy Land, Mariejoa.

228
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,730
He came to be known as
the hero who freed the slaves.

229
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,440
At the same time,
he was labeled a dangerous criminal.

230
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,930
As of this moment, I am resigning.

231
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,370
Jinbe!  Are you going to abandon your duties in the army?!

232
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,450
The duty of protecting the island
suited me better than I thought it would.

233
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,760
However, there are times when one's morals are more important than one's duty!

234
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,350
Big Brother Ti has finally done it!

235
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,680
The Arlong Pirates will join with Fisher Tiger immediately!

236
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,050
Let's go, men!

237
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,970
And so the former outcasts of the Fishman District,
who all looked up to him, gathered together.

238
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,190
Welcome to the pirate business.

239
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,360
From now on, the world itself will be our enemy.

240
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,500
All who are prepared for this, step forward!

241
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,640
To avoid discrimination between the former slaves who Tiger had freed and those who came freely...

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,810
every member of the crew branded the emblem of the sun where it would hide the marks of slavery.

243
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,240
The fishmen had formed the Sun Pirates.

244
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,630
So he really went and did it.

245
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Fishman Island's standing has fallen once more.

246
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,650
We probably won't even be able to
attend this year's world council meeting.

247
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,440
What should we do about this?

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,080
But, on that day...

249
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,660
I couldn't have stopped him.

250
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,200
You... What did you see on your latest voyage?

251
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,460
Humans.

252
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,130
When I listened to his heartfelt voice, it was screaming terribly.

253
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,350
Extra!  Extra!  Breaking news!

254
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,450
He made a surprise attack on the Celestial Dragons.  People aren't even supposed to touch them!

255
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,610
That's Fisher Tiger, the hero of Fishman Island!

256
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,850
Amazing!  A fishman's made history!

257
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,730
Everyone, please listen!

258
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,420
Oh, it's Queen Otohime!

259
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,310
This again?

260
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,910
We were all afraid.  We ran away and hid ourselves.

261
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,650
But what have we learned from that?

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,550
Just because some human nobles
have committed unforgivable crimes against us,

263
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,420
Fishmankind must not start
mercilessly killing all humans.

264
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,830
Now then, let us try to coexist with the humans.

265
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,380
Let us try to learn more about the surface dwellers
who live under the shining sun.

266
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,270
We know more than enough about them.

267
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah, I feel bad for the Queen, but...

268
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,370
You two, over there!

269
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,470
Sign this.

270
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,300
I can't, Otohime-sama.

271
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,020
Right now, everyone on the island is in support of Tiger's amazing feat.

272
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,880
This incident's going to mean a complete separation from the humans.

273
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,800
But the humans are obviously in the wrong...

274
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
So right now, we just can't...

275
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,870
If it's impossible now then we can wait seven, eleven, or even fifteen years.  Whatever it takes.

276
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,800
For the day when this country
participates in the world council meeting again...

277
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,420
Please!  Sign this form!  Please!

278
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,050
Fisher Tiger's amazing!

279
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,720
Just like when he was boss of the Fishman District.

280
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,390
It says the Celestial Dragons are really pissed off.

281
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,220
You know, those Celestial Dragons.

282
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,860
Oh yeah?!

283
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,350
He took out those sickening humans.

284
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,440
All humans are trash.

285
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,870
Just like Arlong-san always says.

286
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,770
They really are inferior!

287
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,700
The Sun Pirates on the surface, going wherever they want and beating up all the humans -dosun.

288
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,820
They're amazing -dosun.

289
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,160
If we were stronger,
we could have gone up there with them -hi.

290
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,210
Great!  Great!  One day, I'll join 'em!

291
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,610
Take them out, Sun Pirates!  Kill the human scum!

292
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,920
Yeah!

293
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,490
Boss!  Boss!  An enemy ship's been spotted -nyuu!

294
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,970
Boss!  Boss!  Boss!

295
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,140
Boss Ti!  There's trouble!

296
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,980
Man, shut up, Hachi!

297
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,480
Why don't you calm down?

298
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,640
You sure are noisy.  Is it the Navy?

299
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,740
There's no mistake, it's the Sun Pirates.

300
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,370
Take Tiger's head!

301
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,760
You missed!

302
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,440
Fire!

303
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,470
What're you doing?!  Aim properly!

304
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,430
But they're submerged under the water!

305
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,370
Whoops.

306
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,490
You damn fishmen!

307
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,660
Hand over all the runaway slaves!

308
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,760
Then maybe we'll overlook your crimes.

309
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,940
R-Rear Admiral...
T-They're attacking through the hull.

310
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,470
What?!

311
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,140
Quietly hand over the slaves!

312
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,790
What you're doing is a major crime!

313
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,580
Attacking humans?  Fishmen should know their place!

314
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,040
What was that?  Say it again.

315
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,090
Just try to say it again!

316
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,740
Help...

317
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Damn slavery is okay, but liberation's a crime?

318
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,790
And she wants us to love the humans?

319
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,520
That Queen Otohime...

320
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,500
Fire!  Fire!

321
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,210
Aim and fire!  We've got the intel!

322
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,720
You're harboring runaway slaves!

323
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,800
N-No way?!

324
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,060
Runaway slaves, you say?

325
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,350
Is he a monster?!

326
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,410
Do you see any evidence of them here?

327
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,880
Look at all of our bodies.

328
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,620
The mark that runaway slaves are supposed to have...

329
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,950
Do you see anyone here with it?

330
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,850
Lemme go!  Stop it!  What're you doing?!

331
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,370
No!  Help!

332
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,890
Relax.  I'm going to let you go.

333
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,420
I'm not like you humans.

334
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,220
Listen up men! Grab their loot and food,
and get back to our ship!

335
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,680
I sentence you to death.

336
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,430
Human, your very existence is an inexcusable crime.

337
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,820
Hold it!  Arlong!

338
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,020
Die!

339
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,860
Vice-Admiral Borsalino...

340
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,490
Unit G2, Rear Admiral Kadaru's ship... has been lost.

341
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,500
Oh?  Why'd they try to fight them?

342
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,880
I told them to just report their location.

343
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,130
They're saying that if you get close enough to see them then they'll surround you.

344
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,360
Oh, how scary... Guess I shouldn't expect any less
from underwater professionals.

345
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,390
So?  What kind of people were on the ship?

346
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,320
Sir.

347
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,820
Some pirates who were recently on the sea floor
near Fishman Island, Arlong's crew, are on the ship.

348
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,740
Since they're naturally adept at fighting in the water, it's difficult to measure their combat abilities.

349
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,770
Arlong... I've heard the rumors.

350
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,780
There's also talk of
another strongly built man in Tiger's ranks.

351
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,330
He's incredibly strong,
but we don't even know his name.

352
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,630
Oh, how troubling.

353
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,380
That hurt!

354
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,150
What's that for?!

355
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,170
Just because I took out one or two pieces of inferior trash?!

356
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,100
You two went too far.

357
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,290
We're not some band of common murderers.

358
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,690
Don't get carried away!

359
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,170
But, Brother Ti... I mean, Boss,

360
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,330
they were shooting to kill you.

361
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,930
It's only natural that we should hit them back just as hard!

362
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,980
It makes us mad, after all!

363
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,160
We lose if we kill them.

364
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,790
Do you want to become like them?!

365
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,490
This isn't a mission of revenge for the history of segregation.

366
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,260
What I did at Mariejoa wasn't either.

367
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,870
I may have broken their ridiculous laws, but
it was only to free those who were being oppressed!

368
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,980
The Sun Pirates fight for freedom and liberty.
Nothing else!

369
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,410
If we hold onto grudges and
start taking revenge on the humans,

370
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,150
it will just spawn more tragedy
since the humans will try to get revenge in turn.

371
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,030
Future fishmen, innocent of any crime,
will be punished for the crimes of their ancestors!

372
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,120
Don't you understand?!

373
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,500
We can fight and steal from
those who pursue us, but that's the line.

374
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,420
We don't kill anyone!

375
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,670
I've been wanting to say something
to you for a while now, Big Brother.

376
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,260
Worried about the humans taking revenge?

377
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,640
If they try to take revenge, we can just kill them!

378
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,320
We should be so brutal
that the humans tremble in fear before us!

379
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,400
If we do that, they won't even think of striking back.

380
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,360
They just don't know about
the strength and ruthlessness of fishmen.

381
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,370
We should burn it into their eyes...

382
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,300
Fear us!

383
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,040
What the hell're you doing?!

384
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,640
Jinbe, Queen Otohime's campaign is the ideal solution.

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,070
To her, what's the difference between me and Arlong?

386
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,270
The thing that scares me the most
is the demon living in my heart.

387
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,330
Nyuu- A pirate ship!

388
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,870
That's a huge ship!

389
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,980
They're trying to get famous by defeating us.

390
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,350
So now we have to deal with guys like this too?

391
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,680
If we keep sinking them,
they'll stop coming eventually.

392
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,860
We were wanted by the Government and had to fight every day.

393
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,990
Queen Otohime also tried to
fight against the world in her own way.

394
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,280
Sign it!

395
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,930
To live together with the humans?

396
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,240
We'll pass, Your Majesty.

397
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,720
Sign it!

398
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,650
Hey!  Bounties have been placed
on Boss Ti's and Jinbe-san's heads!

399
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,420
What?!

400
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,130
Wow!  230 million beli!

401
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,260
And Jinbe's at 76 million beli!

402
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Wanted posters!
It looks like their bounties have gone up!  Wow!

403
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,620
Looks like the World Government is shaking in their boots.

404
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,560
Down with the Navy!

405
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,070
Sign it!

406
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,220
Give me a break!

407
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,450
It was like that for three years.

408
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,110
But then I encountered a girl on a certain island.

409
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,410
Will you do us a favor?

410
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,080
Three years ago, when you freed us slaves,
this girl escaped from Mariejoa with us.

411
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,370
As you can see.

412
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,910
But the town where her family lives
is quite far from here.

413
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,680
We wanted to take her
but we can't sail these dangerous seas.

414
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm Koala.  I'm eleven years old.

415
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,310
Thank you very much for saving me three years ago.

416
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,790
Even if she's just a kid,
she's still human!  Disgusting!

417
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,250
Why'd you let a human on the same ship as us?

418
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,620
It's progress.

419
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,620
Quit grinning like that!  You're really pissing me off!

420
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,080
Arlong-san!

421
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,220
Arlong-san!

422
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,770
Lemme go, Hachi!  I'm not finished!

423
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,130
Indeed.  She never stops smiling, and it's kind of creepy.

424
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,080
You...

425
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
I'm sorry.  I'll work.

426
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,310
I'll do all the cleaning and never stop to rest,
so please do not hit me.

427
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,730
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

429
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,130
What're you doing?

430
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,990
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

432
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,410
Hey, you're bleeding.

433
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,330
I'm sorry.

434
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,620
No matter what, I won't cry.  So please don't kill me.

435
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,590
Hey, you can stop that.  Do you think we're so scary?

436
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,260
Yes, but I want to see my mother.

437
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,180
So I grit my teeth and boarded your ship.

438
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,330
If I take a break, you might kill me, right?

439
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,600
I'll make myself useful, so please do not kill me.

440
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,450
She knows nothing other than slavery.

441
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,140
A slave may be killed for something as trivial as crying.

442
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,490
They can also be killed for
taking a break from cleaning.

443
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:33,160
They're always thinking, "Maybe I'm next."
They live in continual fear but won't show it.

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,030
Boss.

445
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,630
Bring this kid to my room.

446
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,040
What're they doing in there?

447
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,440
Giving her a lecture won't help.  Her spirit's been broken.

448
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,790
Boss!  What're you doing in there!?

449
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,520
Cauterizing the wound.

450
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,610
It's violent, but as long as she bore the mark
she'd never forget things that are best forgotten.

451
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,040
Hey, are you alive?

452
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,430
Oh, she's awake!

453
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,840
It seems I fainted.  I'm sorry.

454
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,390
But look, I didn't cry.  So please do not kill me.

455
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,600
No matter what you do to me,
I won't cry.  So please do not kill me.

456
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,100
There's nothing wrong with crying!

457
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,750
Don't think that we're the same
as those stupid Celestial Dragons.

458
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,530
Watch closely.

459
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,030
We don't kill anyone.

460
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,110
Men, we're off!

461
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,790
We're going to take this girl...

462
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,160
and make sure she gets home!

463
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,180
Koala has returned to her home,

464
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:25,620
but the Sun Pirates are ambushed by the Navy,
and Tiger is confronted by Strawberry.

465
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,460
After a bloody battle, Tiger reveals his shocking past.

466
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,380
After Tiger's death, many of the citizens on Fishman Island withdraw their signatures.

467
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,260
and Jinbe decides to join the Shichibukai, to protect the former slaves freed by Tiger.

468
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,620
Next time, on One Pace:

469
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,800
{\an5}The Shocking Truth of Tiger!
The End of the Sun Pirates
