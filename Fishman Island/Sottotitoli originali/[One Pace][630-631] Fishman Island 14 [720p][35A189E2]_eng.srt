1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,910
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,830
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,330
Central Fishman Island, Candy Factory Town.

10
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,730
Daruma-san?!  What the...

11
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,340
Those walls are made of rock.

12
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,570
What are his jaws made of?

13
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,600
My teeth are aching!

14
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,260
Idiots!

15
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,030
You bring me cappuccino and some sort of fancy cake
for my precious snack time?!

16
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,940
You think I'm some sort of office lady?!{It's hard to explain the stereotypes of an OL, but imagine a Japanese woman who enjoys foreign cakes and coffee.  Of course, the stereotype goes *far* beyond that, but that's as far as it's relevant to this line.} {Gil : Look, he says Office Lady in English. It makes as much sense as "20-something female" to an English speaking viewer and still gets the idea that it's some stereotype across. I don't see why we should translate English to English.}

17
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,100
F-Forgive me, Daruma-san!

18
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,470
How about I just eat the flesh off your bones instead?!

19
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,170
Huge fish bones are my favorite food!

20
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,650
Don't forget it!

21
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,950
Yes, Sir.  I'll be incredibly careful from now on.

22
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,090
Well, whatever.  I'll just feast on the royal family and the royal guard to my heart's content instead!

23
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm gonna head over to Gyoncord Plaza.

24
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,630
Everyone's going to be there!  Don't be late!

25
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,020
What about the citizens?

26
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,260
Didn't you hear what the boss said?

27
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,820
He said "You can quit with the fumi-e!"

28
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,380
Do what you want with 'em!

29
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,500
Every single one of them already knows that their fate has been decided!

30
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,860
{\an5}Gyoncorde Plaza Gathering!
The Evil Drug's True Power

31
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,060
In the New Fishman Pirates,

32
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,540
including Hody, four of the generals are shark fishmen.

33
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,020
On top of that, one is a giant squid.{That is, he is a "giant squid"-type, not a giant "squid-type".}

34
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,580
They also have the best swordsman on Fishman Island.  That blue-ringed octopus fishman mercenary.

35
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,260
And the ones our hopes are resting on are...

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,500
the three Neptune brothers. {Gil : Fade out on this line?}

37
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,020
They can definitely do it!  The Princes can do it!

38
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,170
Northern Fishman Island, Waterwheel Town

39
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,900
The Princes were heading toward Gyoncord Plaza.

40
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,860
What's going to happen to our country?

41
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,250
Good question.

42
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,750
Why are our lives being threatened just because we wanted to improve fishman-human relations.

43
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,240
The King being executed is unthinkable.

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,570
If we use the guys that the Princes captured as hostages...

45
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,100
then couldn't we stop them?

46
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,310
It's all over.

47
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,760
Boss Hody is a callous man -kotsun.{He changed from -dosun to -kotsun}

48
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,490
If we're hostages,
then he'll just throw our lives away -kotsun.{He refers to *kirisute*, literally, "cutting and throwing away", or slightly more liberally, "cutting and walking away", the ancient Japanese right of samurai to kill lesser samurai and peasants.}{ def: sacrafice our lives }

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
This is no good.

50
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,790
After all the damage that he took from Prince Fukaboshi's group,

51
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,320
Dosun-san's power gauge has fallen all the way down to "kotsun".{What does the scouter say about his power level, Vegeta?!}

52
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,310
Hurry up and get him an energy steroid...

53
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,100
Alright!

54
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,400
He's always been that way.

55
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,070
He's too proud -potsun...

56
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,540
Potsun?

57
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,470
He even hates the fishmen
who've done business with human pirates -posun.

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,010
Posun?

59
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:49,020
And any fishmen found giving a blood transfusion to a human will get a knife in the back -tosun.

60
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,570
Tosun?

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Human blood is dirty -tosun.

62
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,570
We give and they take, and then they...

63
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,650
look down on the blood of fishmen -dosun!

64
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,720
He's back to being Dosun-san!

65
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,120
Any fishmen who support those inferior humans...

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,640
are interfering with our ambitions!{Something a bit more emphatic than "noble cause" would be better, but I couldn't think of anything.}

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,980
Quiet!

68
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,440
They're in the way -dokan!

69
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,140
He's gone past dosun!

70
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,540
He broke out of the chains!

71
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,540
Why you!

72
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,290
The soldiers were taken out in an instant!

73
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,850
You hear that Fukaboshi -pokan?!

74
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,930
I'm smashing you next -zugan!

75
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,970
Let's go, guys -bagon!

76
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,290
To Gyoncord Plaza, the site of the execution -gyaban!

77
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,410
Yeah!

78
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,100
Southern Fishman Island, in front of the Fish-People Cultural Center.

79
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,780
{Drunkenly}Eh?  Who's drunk?

80
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,940
You are, Hyouzou-san!

81
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,540
Pull yourself together!  You can't fight like this!

82
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,620
It's fine.  It's fine.  I'll cover the bill.

83
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,850
What're you talking about?!

84
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,010
You know we're going to be fighting
the Neptune Army, led by Fukaboshi.

85
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,480
If we don't finish it quickly, even Jinbe might show up!

86
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,980
Come on, stand up!

87
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,850
It's no use.

88
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,270
He's as slippery and as shameless as a sea cucumber.

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,740
But you're so good at spinning your head around...

90
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,760
Nothing's spinning!  You're just wasted!

91
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,370
Jeez, he can't even hold a sword like this!

92
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,950
You say I can't hold a sword?

93
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,040
Hey!  Get away from him!

94
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,540
When Hyouzou's this wasted, he starts cutting things down indiscriminately!{Lit. the drunker he gets, the more he cuts people indiscriminately with reckless abandon.  Also, I think this is a direct reference to the Kurosawa film, "Seven samurai" (七人の侍).}

95
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,300
He's a murderous drunk!{as opposed to a violent drunk}

96
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,390
Murderous... drunk?

97
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,890
He killed his own allies?!

98
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,630
I'm not done yet!

99
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,950
I still wanna kill more people!{I still want to cut more people!}

100
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,670
H-Hyouzou-san, please hurry over to the plaza...

101
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,770
and massacre the Neptune family over there, okay?

102
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,100
Nobody knows what you're saying!

103
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,870
Eastern Fishman Island, Marine Shopping Mall

104
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,750
This is already over.
Just what do you think you can do?

105
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,490
It's pointless!

106
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,480
Zeo-san can change his color to mimic his environment, like a chameleon.{that's not what chameleons can do! >:O}

107
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,920
Even we don't know where he is!

108
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,880
T-There's no way we can win against this kind of ability!

109
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,880
If there was any kind of hope...

110
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,720
it would be the three Neptune brothers.

111
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,660
But even they are going to die.{Particularly closely TLC these lines.}

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,810
In other words, the likes of you...

113
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,230
There's a bug!

114
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,730
Stomp it dead!

115
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,020
What?  The voice... it stopped halfway through...

116
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,520
How's that?  Is the cockroach dead?

117
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, it's completely flat.

118
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,270
In other words, the likes of you have no place to run.

119
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,720
No place to run!

120
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,760
He maintained his dignity!
As we'd expect from the noble of the Fishman District.

121
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,670
Is he pretending nothing happened?

122
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,620
This is a revolution.

123
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,210
In Gyoncord Plaza, no matter what happens here,

124
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,420
today will be the death of the Neptune Royal Family,
and with it, the birth of a new king.

125
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,720
Now, let's go to the plaza!

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
How long until we reach Gyoncord Plaza?

127
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,290
It's less than one hour away.

128
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,780
But there's no way he'd go so far out of his way just to execute the king in the plaza.

129
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,320
That can't be their true motive.

130
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,960
All they want is to lure you out there!

131
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,450
It doesn't matter what their motives are.

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,980
This is something we have to do.

133
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,240
I won't let them lay a finger on Father.

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,080
I won't let him close the hearts of the citizens that we worked so hard to open either!

135
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,630
I guess this is why Jinbe never took his eyes off Hody.

136
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,680
It must be because of Hody that no human pirates have been coming to the island lately.

137
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,500
Shirahoshi is probably still inside Koukaku Tower.

138
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,980
I'm worried that we haven't received
any information on her -fa-so-la-ti-do!{TLC check this. あいつ is not the normal word for his sister.}

139
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,190
Say, Brother Fukaboshi, what do you think of the Straw Hat Pirates?

140
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,260
Madame Shyarly certainly predicted that they will destroy this island, but...

141
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,080
When I met them face-to-face,
I certainly didn't feel any malice.

142
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,920
I agree.  They're friends with Jinbe too,

143
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,780
and the mermaids in the bay
said that they're not bad people.

144
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,670
Those mermaids' ability
to read personalities is quite sharp.

145
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,200
But now is not the time to be worrying about things we don't understand.

146
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,470
That's exactly right -la-ti-do!

147
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,980
Gather all the soldiers in the country.  We will definitely rescue the king!

148
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,910
Sir!

149
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,770
Fishverly Hills in northeast Fishman Island.

150
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,340
You cur!

151
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,830
Why are we completely helpless against a single sea creature?

152
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,280
There's something strange about that beast.

153
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,660
The Energy Steroids were too effective!

154
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,750
Calm down, Sea Bear!  That's enough!

155
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,430
The soldiers are all but finished!

156
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,530
Stop, Sea Bear!

157
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,580
Get fire!  Sea beasts are weak against fire!{It's super effective!}

158
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,710
Stop!

159
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,140
What's going on?  Ikaros-san's body's all weird.

160
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,030
What kind of curse is this?!

161
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,410
Put the fire out -hi!  You damn idiot!

162
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,390
Oh, the crackling fire -hi...

163
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,340
What about the fire?

164
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm going to become grilled squid -hi!{Uh, how familiar are Western audiences with grilled squid?  Japanese eat it all the time, but I think this gag might not go over so well with Western audiences...}{Gil: Well, it's not like "western audiences" are all retards who can't work out such a simple gag.}

165
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,750
You think we're gonna grill you, idiot?!
Oh, excuse me.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,350
If you were thinking about trying to grill me to death,

167
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,180
then you can kiss your life goodbye -hi!

168
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,130
It never even occurred to me, idiot!  Oh, excuse me.

169
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,840
A long time ago, Ikaros-san had a good friend who was a giant squid.

170
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,330
But then, one day, he got too close to the sun...

171
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,540
and he became giant grilled squid.

172
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,480
That trauma means that whenever he sees fire...

173
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,270
Daidaros!{the name of his squid friend}

174
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,530
As if the same thing could happen to a fishman.

175
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,560
Daida...

176
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,750
Be careful from now on!

177
00:13:51,310 --> 00:14:00,590
Oh no!  When his dried squid spear pierces someone, it will drain all their water and turn back into a squid.

178
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,800
Squid!

179
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,300
Squid!  Squid!  Squid!

180
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,470
H-He's too cruel, hitting that guy even after he's been sucked dry...

181
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,450
Ikaros-san, please stop!

182
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,270
We've got to get to the plaza, right?

183
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,820
Indeed!{Note, this is a Japanese play on words, since it could also mean, "All the way to a squid!"}{Gil : Muhi- Indeed.}

184
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,740
Oh no... Now I'm a dried squid.

185
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,440
Minister of the Right, look in the sky!

186
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,190
Is that Hody?

187
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,250
I can't see Hody,
but they are from the Fishman District!

188
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,620
They're heading toward the plaza!

189
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,460
Damn them!

190
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,220
Look!  The King's up there!

191
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,880
King Neptune!

192
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,590
Please save us!

193
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,780
Show us the miracles of the Great Knight!

194
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,430
Don't call me the Great Knight.

195
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,490
I can't even protect my subjects like this...

196
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,120
It's too cruel!

197
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,300
Your Majesty...

198
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,480
Even though we call ourselves the Royal Army, we couldn't even protect a single King.

199
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,490
What's the point of such an army?!

200
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,510
Ikaros-san, just two hours left until the king's execution!

201
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,280
Let's head toward Gyoncord Plaza!

202
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,030
What's happened to Captain Hody?

203
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,590
He's there, isn't he -hi?!

204
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,740
Why doesn't he show his face -hi?!

205
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,120
Well...

206
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,690
It's a drug that gives you power by shortening your life.

207
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,900
This is merely the consequence of relying on it too much.

208
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,760
Shut it!

209
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:43,100
Captain Hody says the wound he got from that pirate swordsman has been aching...

210
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,640
Wounded?  Our captain?!

211
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,480
...so he's been taking Energy Steroid after Energy Steroid to dull the pain.

212
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,910
And then, well, we tried to stop him, but...

213
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,290
Captain Hody!

214
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,210
It... hurts... to... breathe...

215
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,750
My body's about to explode!

216
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,770
Is this some sort of side effect -hi?!

217
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,090
I knew that drug was bad stuff -hi!

218
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,780
What's the matter, Sea Bear?!

219
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,160
Something's wrong.  The sea creatures are all under...

220
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,400
Hody's control, but I've never seen such fear in their eyes.{lit. body posture}

221
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,700
Captain... Hey, Captain!

222
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,650
Captain Decken!  Things can only get better.

223
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,600
You idiot!  I don't want you comforting me!

224
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,680
Do you have any idea how it feels
to be rejected when you reach out to someone?!

225
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,790
Sure, Shirahoshi was just a kid at first...

226
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,880
I just decided to marry her so that
I could fulfill my ancestors' dreams.

227
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,690
But look at her now!

228
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,770
You're just not my type. {Copy-paste from 537.}

229
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,860
"You're just not my type."

230
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,250
Upon hearing her say this,

231
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,540
I realized my feelings... I presume.

232
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,840
I realized my feelings... I presume.

233
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,530
(Haiku with too many syllables)

234
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,890
- By Vander Decken the Ninth

235
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,750
My love was unrequited...

236
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,160
Unrequited!

237
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,440
Because she turned me down, I've cut my hair!

238
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,470
Only the top of his head?!

239
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,210
I want to kill her right here and now,
and yet she still lives!

240
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,260
She must be alive because
the items I throw still fly at her!

241
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,260
That damned Straw Hat is protecting her!

242
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,530
Oh, right.

243
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,780
What is it?

244
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,950
I know!  I just have to destroy everything!

245
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,960
Every last thing!

246
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
I just had a great idea!

247
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,010
Th-

248
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,750
The Neptune Army was defeated.

249
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,490
They've been crushed.

250
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,630
I can't believe how strong Hody is.

251
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,730
Right Minister!

252
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,980
Left Minister!

253
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,500
Neptune-sama... {Swashbuckla: Seems like this sub appears too early imo}

254
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,160
Almost... {Swashbuckla: This sub appears a little early too.}

255
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,110
We almost made it!

256
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,000
It looked like your dreams would've come to pass during this year's World Council Meeting...

257
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,560
Queen Otohime!

258
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,520
And all of a sudden, this happens!

259
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,110
Please, watch over him...

260
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,670
At this rate, the King will be killed!

261
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,670
Please, keep our King safe!

262
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,630
We can't get inside!
The entrance to Gyoncord Plaza has been shut!

263
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,130
Neptune-sama!

264
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,760
Let's climb above the plaza!
We might be able to peek inside!

265
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,200
Hurry!

266
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,930
Go, Megalo!

267
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,040
These soldiers claimed that
they were gonna protect the country!  How pathetic!

268
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,330
My men...

269
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,340
Hody!

270
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,240
That soldier over there is up to something.

271
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,360
Where?

272
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,470
He's gonna blow himself up with dynamite,
and try to take some of us with him -bokan!

273
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,560
Muhi!  If he does that, I'll turn into a fried squid -hi!

274
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:13,220
It might help if I can take out
even one of Hody's men before the Princes get here!

275
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,370
That guy's dangerous!

276
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,820
{\an8}Shooting water

277
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,140
How far is it gonna go?!

278
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,920
What's that?

279
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,500
Huh?

280
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,140
I can hear something...

281
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,670
Hey...

282
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,830
I thought the Uchimizu attack had only the same power as a bullet?

283
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,820
Even if it is because you've
taken so many Energy Steroids, that was amazing -hi!

284
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,060
Your hair's gone all white,
and your body has changed...

285
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,960
How do you feel, Captain?

286
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,190
Never been better.

287
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,040
Soldiers...

288
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,750
Why didn't you wait for us?!

289
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,550
Fukaboshi!  Ryuuboshi!  Manboshi!

290
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,610
Be careful!  The sea beasts and
the fishmen have all taken drugs!

291
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,660
Figures.  Otherwise, I doubt the Neptune Army would have fallen so easily -re-mi-fa!

292
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,050
Wait just a little longer, Father!

293
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,810
Why don't you understand, Hody Jones?!

294
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,410
You are far weaker than anyone else on this island!

295
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,860
The citizens of this island have turned their backs on
a long history of discrimination by the humans.

296
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,260
They let time wash away the deaths of a hero and the Queen even though humans killed them.

297
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,500
They clenched their teeth
and committed themselves to change the future...

298
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,120
by putting down their signatures!

299
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,050
Prince...

300
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,170
Fukaboshi-sama!

301
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,300
Why don't you understand that there's strength in their kindness?!

302
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,970
Kindness?  What good is that nonsense?

303
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,390
Do you want to be betrayed by the humans again?

304
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,140
{\an8}Merman Combat

305
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,780
{\an8}Flying Time Spear

306
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,420
{\an8}Seven Great Treasures

307
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
{\an8}Dragon Palace Gate

308
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,290
Th-They beat the sea beasts!

309
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,460
You fools only want to
hold onto your grudges and take revenge.

310
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,500
The King's head, the home of the citizens, and Ryuuguu Kingdom itself...

311
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,680
We will not let you take any of it!

312
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,910
They're so strong!  I'd expect no less from the three brothers of Ryuuguu Kingdom!

313
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,190
We won't lose.

314
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,450
We have been granted power from the heavens.

315
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,240
Power that will let us create
a real country for Fishmankind.

316
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,460
We will take you down,
and choose a future where we can love the humans!

317
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,800
If you win now then it might be hundreds of years before humans and fishmen can coexist peacefully!

318
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,970
Say what you want.

319
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,560
But in the end, this country...

320
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,600
will belong to the winners, right?

321
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,890
There's something strange about them...

322
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,810
Here they come!

323
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,610
W-What is this?!

324
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,150
Too slow.

325
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,880
Dosun!

326
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,880
Squid!

327
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,120
Hurry, Megalo!

328
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,960
Father... Please be safe...

329
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,770
It's alright.  We'll be fine!
