1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,910
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,790
I left everything in that one place.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

11
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:39,250
{\an5}At the Sea Forest!
Arlong and Hody

12
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Zoro?

13
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,140
Boss!  Boss!  Boss!

14
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,390
How can a human move faster than
a fishman in the water?!

15
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,930
Who is that guy?

16
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,990
Don't let that swordsman get away!

17
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,030
Everyone take your Energy Steroids.

18
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,680
What a nuisance they are!
Exterminate everyone in the Neptune Army!

19
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,470
Damn it.

20
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,530
What's this?  Such an unnatural aura.

21
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,730
Damn.  If they're gonna fight like that then we'll massacre everyone!

22
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,350
Zoro!

23
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,050
The palace will be completely flooded soon.

24
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,680
You should grab on to my body!

25
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,710
They're taking out our best soldiers so easily.

26
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,910
They must be using some sort of sinister power.

27
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,310
Just as I thought,
I must get all the soldiers out of the palace.

28
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,180
Hey!  Use this to make sure you have air -jamon.

29
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,690
Ah, thanks!

30
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,290
Hold onto my body tightly -jamon!

31
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,110
Got it!

32
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,450
We can't delay, we must go now -jamon!

33
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,540
Zoro!  Over here!  Grab hold of the old man!

34
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,990
I wonder if my injured back will hold out.

35
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,130
Listen up, soldiers!
We're gonna carve a path out of here!

36
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,840
Don't stay and fight.  Flee the palace!

37
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,980
Zoro, use this!

38
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,130
Here we go!

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
Neptune's doing something!

40
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,850
Zoro!

41
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,010
Ouch!  Ow, ow, ow, ow...

42
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,380
Men, go now!

43
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,390
Yes, sir!

44
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,040
Ride the current as far as you can!

45
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,250
Damn it, they're running away without fighting!

46
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,690
Boss Hody!  Quickly, take this!

47
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,190
We're out of the castle!  Keep moving!

48
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,320
Go through the connecting channel, all the way to the mainland!

49
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey, old man!
Get it together!  I'm begging you!

50
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,270
Age can be so cruel.

51
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,580
I can't move at all -jamon.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,960
What?!

53
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,300
Your Majesty!

54
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,840
King Neptune!

55
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,930
Oh, Hoe.

56
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,090
You've saved us!

57
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,210
I apologize for my frailty.
I couldn't even move my neck -jamon.

58
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,410
Are you okay?

59
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,560
Thank God, Hoe helped him get out!

60
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,080
Go!

61
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm out of air.

62
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,960
What?

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,820
What's going on?

64
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,510
Your Majesty!

65
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,000
This is terrible!  Hody caught His Majesty!

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,190
Wasn't Hody supposed to be incapacitated?

67
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,540
Minister of the Right!  Let's go back!
At this rate, His Majesty's going to be...

68
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,660
You mustn't -jamon!

69
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,170
You must go on without me,
and bring back Fukaboshi and his brothers!

70
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,790
Don't just stand there!  Obey the King's orders!

71
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,050
Yes, sir!

72
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,420
Boss Hody, is it okay to let them get away?

73
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,820
Yeah it's fine, let them go.

74
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,800
What can a bunch of warriors who'd abandon their king do?

75
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,230
But more importantly,
tie up this foolish king.

76
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,030
Yes, sir!

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,950
I'm sorry, you guys...

78
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,570
but I won't let you get killed!

79
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,470
What's this?

80
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,840
Who knows?  Probably someone's skeleton.

81
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,990
This place is beautiful!

82
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,750
So this is the Sea Forest?

83
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,000
You see, I've always wanted to come here.

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,420
I am truly indebted to you, Luffy-sama.

85
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,980
I hope we can rest and recuperate here.

86
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,690
Mermaid.... Mermaid...

87
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,230
Sanji.

88
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,980
Oh, it's the Sunny!

89
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,650
You're right!  Franky's there, too!

90
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,830
Hey, Franky!  So this is where you've been?

91
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,240
Is that you, Luffy?

92
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,410
Huh?

93
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,330
Well, if you didn't bring a pinup girl with you?!

94
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,590
I'll introduce ya.  This is Wimp.

95
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,890
Oh, Wimp, huh?
Sounds like you need to get your act together.

96
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes, sorry for troubling you.  My name is Shirahoshi.

97
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,540
Franky, are you the only one here?

98
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,400
Actually, Robin was here too,

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,300
but then she went off in search of something.

100
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,870
She went into that huge coral forest.

101
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Huh.

102
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,660
{I completely forgot his spelling in English}Luffy-kun.

103
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,370
Jinbe!

104
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,370
If it isn't Jinbe!

105
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,430
It's been quite a while.

106
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,810
It looks like you're quite a bit stronger.  I can see the difference.

107
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,480
I heard you weren't down here,
so I didn't think I'd be able to see you.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,290
What do you mean?
Didn't you get my message to meet me here?

109
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,240
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about that.

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,410
That's strange.

111
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,580
Boss Jinbe-sama,
it's certainly been quite a while since we last met.

112
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm sorry for failing to keep in touch with you,
Princess Shirahoshi-sam-

113
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,960
Whaaat!

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,510
Princess Shirahoshi!  Why are you here?!

115
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,970
Hey Franky!  I wanna bring
Hachi and Sanji down, so give me a hand.

116
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,570
Huh?

117
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,030
If it ain't the octopus guy!

118
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,820
What happened to ya?

119
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,100
Hachi!  What!

120
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,880
Where did those injuries come from?

121
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,690
More importantly,
why are you on Fishman Island?

122
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,110
Weren't you captured along with Arlong?

123
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,120
Jinbe-san, why are you here?

124
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,650
Franky!  Sanji's next!

125
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,550
Oh no, it's not that bad.

126
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,000
Huh?

127
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,010
Ah, Mermaid Princess!

128
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,270
Before you, I am like an artist with no talent.

129
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,250
For you see, there is no brush
that could properly capture your radiance!

130
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,110
W-Well...

131
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,650
That's... his normal reaction
in the presence of women!  He's all better!

132
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,950
My canvas could never reflect the beauty
that you possess.

133
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,500
Hooray!  Hooray!
Sanji's returned to his normal strange self!

134
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,710
It sure is loud over there... I wonder what's going on?

135
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,670
Why is Princess Shirahoshi here?

136
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,720
Hey!  Who're you?!  Why are you on the Sunny?!

137
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,550
He's Den-chan, the younger brother of Tom,
my carpentry master!

138
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,430
He's fixing the ship's coating.

139
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,680
Is that who he is?

140
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,370
He's the master who's going to
coat your younger brother, huh?

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
Well, that's close enough!

142
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,610
But Princess Shirahoshi-sama,
I understand why you wanted to come here but-

143
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,950
Still?

144
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,370
Even after the beating I gave him.

145
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,640
How many times has it been now?

146
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,790
He's really persistent.

147
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,250
Listen to me, now!
Why'd you bring the Princess here, Luffy-kun?

148
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,670
It's fine!  I'm here, after all!

149
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,950
That's right!

150
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,260
What is she thinking?

151
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,440
So that's the tomb she was talking about?

152
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,790
She's really been going at it for a long time, now.

153
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,820
This is where her mother, Queen Otohime, is resting.

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,590
Vander Decken started his obstinate courtship...

155
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,900
right after the Queen passed away.

156
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,240
Because of this,
the Princess couldn't even attend her mother's funeral,

157
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,970
and she's spent ten years in Koukaku Tower.

158
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,470
She must have so many things she wants to tell her mother.

159
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,410
Luffy!

160
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,910
Luffy-chin!

161
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,250
Nami!  Caimie!

162
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,220
Wait.  Princess Shirahoshi is there, too.

163
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,930
Whaaat!

164
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,250
Nami!  Has the banquet started yet?

165
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,190
Nami-swaaaaaaaan!

166
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,190
He's completely recovered.

167
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,070
Hacchin!  What happened to you?

168
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,350
Caimie.

169
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,110
Are you sure?  Hody did such a thing?

170
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

171
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,310
To think that the situation
at Ryuuguu Palace is so bad.

172
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,370
So what happened to Zoro and the others?

173
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't know.

174
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,340
I thought we'd go back after we found you.

175
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,410
I-I can't...

176
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,010
I can't believe that my father could be captured like that!

177
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,260
Luffy-kun, my apologies.

178
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,220
I didn't want you to get in trouble,
that's why I left a message for you.

179
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,110
But it seems that you've already been caught up in our affairs.

180
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,960
It is important for us to hurry,

181
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,830
but when I met you two years ago the circumstances were different,

182
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,700
and I couldn't tell you this story at that time.

183
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:45,470
I wanted to offer you my most profound gratitude for stopping Arlong's crew in East Blue.

184
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,550
That was you, wasn't it?

185
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,980
Thank you.

186
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,960
Once again, I'd like to give my thanks.

187
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,410
But at the same time, I must apologize.

188
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,640
Jinbe-san.

189
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,210
The one who set Arlong loose on East Blue eleven years ago...

190
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,890
was me.

191
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,050
King Neptune.

192
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't turn back!  Do you want the king's kindness to go to waste?

193
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,370
There's the exit!

194
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,250
Alright!  We managed to get out!

195
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,920
Use the Bubbly Corals!

196
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,400
How can this be?!  Not only did we leave the king in the castle alone...

197
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,260
but the guards were the only ones
who made it out!  What a disgrace!

198
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,640
Stop crying about it!  This was the king's order!

199
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,970
Men!  This is not a retreat!

200
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,480
We will definitely take out the pirates
inside the palace, and rescue the king!

201
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,770
But first, we need to contact
Fukaboshi and the other princes!

202
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,070
As soon as we've gotten in touch with the princes, and got reinforcements from their troops,

203
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,570
we will return to Ryuuguu Palace!

204
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,570
Yes, Sir!

205
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,950
What's the closest city?

206
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,720
Fishverly Hills.

207
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,190
Watch out!

208
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,800
Meanwhile, in the high class area of Fishman Island,

209
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,330
Fishverly Hills.

210
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,730
Run!

211
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,500
Everyone line up!

212
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,770
Hurry it up, unless you wanna die!

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,430
That's... What do you expect us to do?!

214
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,410
Step on it.

215
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,080
What?!

216
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,970
It's a test.

217
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,150
Don't be absurd!

218
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,890
Silence!  This country will soon belong to Captain Hody -hi.

219
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,610
{\an8}Fumi-e: an icon that's desecrated to show non-allegiance

220
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,610
Step on the fumi-e!

221
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,530
Oh no... I couldn't...

222
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,930
Now, step on it!

223
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,330
Northeast, in the Candy Factory City.

224
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,890
C'mon, get to it!

225
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,670
I-I can't.

226
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,900
Forgive me!  I can't step on it!  Not on her face!

227
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,960
Silence!

228
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,220
You're a human-lover if you don't step on her face!

229
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,260
In other words, you're our enemy!

230
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,560
Southeast, in front of the Fish-People Cultural Center.

231
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,570
No way!

232
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,570
Hey!

233
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,560
It should be an easy choice, right?

234
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,430
Either you step on the fumi-e, or you leave the island.

235
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,530
Don't be ridiculous!

236
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,370
Damn it!  Don't we get a say in this?!

237
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,010
Hurry it up.  If you don't like either choice...

238
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,840
I've been told that I may kill you.

239
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,810
At the Marine Shopping Mall in the east.

240
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,030
Leave the country?!  That's nonsense!

241
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,770
This is the only place on the ocean floor that gets sunlight!

242
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,630
We can't live in the humans' world either!

243
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,060
See?  You're aware of the humans' cruel discrimination against us.

244
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,020
What?  What are you doing?

245
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,710
What's going on?!

246
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,600
Humans and fishmen living in harmony is nothing but a foolish fantasy.

247
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
Just obey us, and bow down before King Hody.

248
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,880
We will rule the humans, and change history!

249
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,800
North, in the Waterwheel City.

250
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,100
Dosun!

251
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,350
Come on.  You're next.

252
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,140
Just make it easy on yourself.

253
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,420
I can't!

254
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,060
I will crush anyone...

255
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,440
who refuses to step on the fumi-e -dosun!

256
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,370
It's you!

257
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,570
Don't get in my way, Fukaboshi!

258
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,730
What do you think you're doing?

259
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,920
Forcing the citizens of this country
to step on a picture of my late mother?!

260
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,270
And in the southeast, on Coral Hill,

261
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,610
the place Luffy and the others just left.

262
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,070
What should we do?!

263
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,480
We let Vander Decken escape,

264
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,020
and Princess Shirahoshi was abducted by the pirate with the straw hat right before our eyes!

265
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,220
But the princess said she'd be back by dinner.

266
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,490
You idiot!  He obviously forced her to say that!

267
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,560
Apparently the people from the Fishman District are causing disturbances in several cities.

268
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
What?!

269
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,800
What's happening on this island?!

270
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,150
Young mermaids are disappearing all over the island...

271
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,960
What if the princess ends up
being sold to the Celestial Dragons?!

272
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,800
Hey!  Another young mermaid seems to have disappeared!

273
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,800
How scary!

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,070
This is awful!

275
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,520
That's my doing...

276
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,650
But more importantly, I just saw something amazing!

277
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,860
Big Sized Mermaid!

278
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,430
If a human-sized mermaid
is worth seventy million beli...

279
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,830
Then if I could capture that Mermaid Princess, who is seven or eight times as big...

280
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,310
And then sell her off!

281
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,000
It's such a huge sum, I can hardly even imagine it!

282
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,000
You...

283
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,130
Why, good day to you!

284
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Father.

285
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,360
It is alright, Princess Shirahoshi.

286
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,240
Even if they manage to restrain the king,
they won't get the chance to actually harm him.

287
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,230
Really?

288
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,270
Yes.  I promise I will save the king!

289
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,990
Alright.  Please do, Boss.

290
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,810
But I'd like some time to speak
to Luffy-kun and his friends first.

291
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,270
My dear ladies...

292
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,860
I made tea.

293
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
Thanks.  Leave it there, Sanji-kun.

294
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,360
Also, we're trying to have a serious conversation, so quit goofing around.

295
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,540
Oh Nami-san, I love it when you're strict!

296
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,920
You haven't changed, Sanji-chin.

297
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,220
Delicious.

298
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,780
I didn't make it for you!

299
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,280
So, Jinbe-san...

300
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,630
What did you mean?

301
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
You said you were the one who set Arlong loose on East Blue.

302
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,710
Jinbe-san...

303
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,090
Yes.

304
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,170
I heard about that.

305
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,300
Long ago, when Luffy and I first heard about the Warlord Jinbe...

306
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,440
Yosaku told us that.

307
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,580
In exchange for a place among the Seven Warlords of the Sea...

308
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,730
Jinbe unleashed a terrible guy upon East Blue.

309
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,410
Hmm, did he?

310
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,780
Knowing you, you probably just forgot.

311
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,100


312
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,800
I wonder how Yosaku's doing?

313
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,060
Two years ago, when I read that article
that said you and Jinbe were working together...

314
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,680
It set question marks dancing around inside my head.

315
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,930
I'd always assumed that Jinbe was
the mastermind controlling Arlong from the shadows.

316
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,850
Hey, Jinbe.

317
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,220
If you have some excuse then I'm willing to listen...

318
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,760
but choose your words carefully.

319
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,770
There's no need to hide it.
The hometown of our beautiful navigator Nami-san...

320
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,470
was on the island that Arlong took over.

321
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:28,190
As a result, she's been put through hell.

322
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,410
If what you just said is true...

323
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,370
then I will never forgive you.

324
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,310
Jinbe-san...

325
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,360
Hacchin!

326
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,440
Your wounds will reopen!  You can't move around yet!

327
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,380
It's true!  The scars we left her...

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,340
are so deep that we can never be forgiven, no matter how much we apologize.

329
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm going to travel across the oceans of the world,
using my own navigational skills!

330
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,330
And then I'll draw a map of the entire world,
based on the things I've seen!

331
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,960
Then this map you drew of the island is the first step toward your dream?

332
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,340
Yeah!

333
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,200
I am your adopted mother, after all.

334
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,110
You two are my precious family.

335
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,870
Pirates!  Pirates are coming!

336
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,030
Greetings... you disgusting, pitiful humans.

337
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,390
From now on, this village...

338
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,110
No, this entire island, belongs to me!

339
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,110
One hundred thousand beli for each adult.

340
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,910
Fifty thousand beli for every child.

341
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,630
We will kill anyone who doesn't pay this tax!

342
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,950
Die for your ridiculous love.

343
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,230
Nojiko!  Nami!

344
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,630
I love you.

345
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,390
What's this?  A map?

346
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,350
Don't!

347
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,750
I drew that map!  It's my treasure!

348
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,390
Give it back!

349
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,350
You drew this?

350
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,510
Give it back!

351
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,510
Don't, Nami!

352
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,590
Very impressive.

353
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,830
She will be useful.  Bring her along.

354
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,110
Right.

355
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,310
No!  Let go!  Let go of me!

356
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,590
No!  Don't!

357
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,790
Why should I have to feed a human?

358
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,290
Just shut up and keep drawing maps!

359
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,970
Gather up one hundred million beli,
and bring it here to me.

360
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,010
If you can do that,
I will release your village and set you free.

361
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,450
Thief!  She stole our treasure!

362
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,970
It's just a kid!

363
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,250
I don't care!  Kill her!

364
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,290
Damn it!  Chase her down!

365
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,810
Seventy million more.

366
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,370
If I can get seventy million more beli, I can...

367
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,610
Oh, I'm impressed that you came back.

368
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,330
Heh, not like you had any other choice.

369
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,330
Welcome back, my cartographer.

370
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,530
It sounds like you've suffered a lot.

371
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,890
Don't talk like this doesn't concern you!

372
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,890
Indeed.

373
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,770
Whatever happened to him,
I'm never gonna feel sorry for Arlong.

374
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,290
But, two years ago,

375
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,320
before I came to the Sabaody Archipelago,
I never knew...

376
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,720
that the fishmen, despite their strength,
were discriminated against by humans.

377
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,280
When Caimie was kidnapped
and we chased after her, I doubted my own eyes.

378
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Because I saw the Sabaody Park, and it looked exactly like the Arlong Park that Arlong built.

379
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
We always longed for it.

380
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm not saying this because I want forgiveness, Nami.

381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,640
Arlong-san hated humans...

382
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,040
He held a grudge against them.

383
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,520
We went too far.

384
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
But, ever since we were children...

385
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,240
we longed for the world
that humans lived in, and that's a fact.

386
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,240
Both me, Arlong-san...

387
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,120
and all the others.

388
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,240
Apparently, in the past,
humans and fishmen were divided...

389
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,160
but then Ryuuguu Kingdom became a part
of the World Government two hundred years ago.

390
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,720
In order to form diplomatic ties with the humans...

391
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,000
the king was given a place in the world council.

392
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,080
But humans continued to hate fishmen.

393
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,520
The worst time I've experienced in my life was when the Great Pirate Age began.

394
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,160
I can still remember the fear of seeing human pirates coming and running wild on this island.

395
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,560
I'll never forget it.

396
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,000
Fishman Island was occupied by humans.

397
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,400
The one who saved us was the late old Whitebeard.

398
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,680
The Old Man announced that he was making Fishman Island his turf,

399
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,600
and peace returned to the island.

400
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,800
But it didn't put an end to
the humans' hate of fishmen.

401
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm sure you all saw it too, on Sabaody.

402
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,040
The harsh reality.

403
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,320
It's strange how it goes...

404
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Once someone has gained power, they are terrified of change.

405
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,600
The Government decided that
humans and fishmen should coexist.

406
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,160
Yet the ones who held power and made that decision discriminated against us more than anyone else!

407
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,160
The relationship between humans and fishmen
didn't change at all.

408
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Because of that,
two people rose up here on Fishman Island...

409
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,080
in an attempt to put an end to this despicable history.

410
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,120
The first one was Queen Otohime.

411
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,120
Princess Shirahoshi's mother, who encouraged the islanders to live in peace with humans.

412
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,600
And the other was the hero who freed the slaves...

413
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
Fisher Tiger.

414
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,320
Something Tiger...
I think I've heard about him before.

415
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,440
He proclaimed that he would
cut our ties with the humans...

416
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,510
and he broke a worldwide taboo.  He went into
the Holy Land of Mariejoa and attacked them, alone.

417
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,950
He freed the slaves.

418
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,870
And after that, he brought all
the former fishman slaves together,

419
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,950
and formed the Sun Pirates!

420
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,870
Sun...

421
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,430
Indeed.  I, Arlong, and Hachi.

422
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,750
Naturally, we were all...

423
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,510
members of the Sun Pirates.

424
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:21,070
However, having the fishman pirates out at sea, fiercely fighting against the World Government...

425
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:29,870
made it harder for Queen Otohime,
who was trying to unite humans and fishmen.

426
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,390
Unlike Queen Otohime, who wanted to
endure the present and change the future...

427
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:43,630
Fisher Tiger abandoned such hopes for the future,
and saved fishman slaves who suffered in the present.

428
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,310
No one can say for sure which one was right.

429
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,870
Let me tell you...

430
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,610
about these two great people, who attempted to change the destiny between humans and fishmen.

431
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,010
And about the screams of their souls.

432
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,890
Queen Otohime, who tried to guide the kingdom to a future where humans and fishmen could coexist.

433
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,210
And the hero, Fisher Tiger, who attempted to free the slaves and fight back against the humans.

434
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:23,770
The fates of these two, overlapped, and a great event that would change history began!

435
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:31,250
Fisher Tiger forms the sun Pirates, and has a fateful encounter with a girl who lived through a cruel reality!

436
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,650
Next time, on One Pace:

437
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,090
{\an5}Otohime, Fisher Tiger, and the Sun Pirates!
The Fateful Encounter!
