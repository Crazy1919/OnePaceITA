1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,310
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,850
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,580
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,190
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,340
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,760
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,760
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,300
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,000
What were they for?

10
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,210
In ancient times, there existed in this world the power to destroy everything.

11
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,340
Three ancient weapons named after the gods...

12
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,970
Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon.

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,520
And she is one of those weapons.

14
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,730
Indeed.

15
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,400
It would be awful
if anyone found out about this, right?

16
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,570
I'm sure that all the major influences around the world would want to claim Shirahoshi's power for their own.

17
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,700
Both the Government and the pirates.

18
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,150
An ancient weapon?
The power to destroy the world, you say?!

19
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,340
I thought I'd just say goodbye to this place now that I have all their treasure,

20
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,260
but I've overheard something
pretty amazing here, haven't I?

21
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
I see, so the Mermaid Princess is...

22
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,140
By the way, Luffy.

23
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,830
How much do you know about what's happening in the world?

24
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,830
What's this, all of a sudden?

25
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,440
Judging from that answer,
I guess you don't know anything.

26
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm worried about your lack of interest.

27
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,360
Really?

28
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,320
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
Will you come outside and talk?

30
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
Alright, just wait a second.

31
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,210
I'm bringing the food with me!

32
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,540
What, you guys are here too?

33
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,380
I drank a lot.
I'm recovering from drinking too much booze.

34
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,270
I'm recovering from eating too much food.

35
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,840
Sanji's recovering from seeing too much mermaid.

36
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,220
Mermaid Island... is the greatest...

37
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,830
What?!  Akainu and Aokiji got into a big fight?!

38
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,900
So I was right.
You don't even know about an event that big?

39
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,480
No.  I didn't hear anything during my training.

40
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,510
Rayleigh was pretty strict, huh?

41
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,430
I heard about it!  I did!

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,590
Seriously?!

43
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,770
Immediately after the war two years ago,

44
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,040
Fleet Admiral Sengoku decided to retire.

45
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,730
Sengoku wanted his trusted subordinate, Aokiji,
to become his successor...

46
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,480
but there were many high ranked government officials
who wanted Akainu instead...

47
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,490
so they both became candidates for the position.

48
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,520
Aokiji rarely shows interest in anything...

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,130
but he was strongly opposed
to Akainu becoming Fleet Admiral.

50
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,210
The two disagreed, and the unprecedented quarrel
between two Admirals escalated...

51
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,730
until they finally settled it in a duel on a certain island.

52
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,120
Dead men tell no tales.

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,260
The loser would no longer be around to complain. {He doesn't outright say that the loser will be unable to complain because he's dead, but it's very heavily implied.}

54
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,230
Control of the Navy would
pass into the hands of whoever won the duel.

55
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,760
Their deathmatch lasted for ten days, and became a subject of conversation all over the world.

56
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,060
They were almost equal in terms of power,
but the battle finally reached a conclusion.

57
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,200
The winner was Akainu.
Sakazuki is the new Fleet Admiral of the Navy!

58
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,590
Akainu!

59
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,100
You're mine! {Copy-paste from 487}

60
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,880
Did Aokiji die?

61
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,770
They were both gravely injured...

62
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,390
but I suppose when he saw
his former comrade collapse before him,

63
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,300
even Akainu felt some remorse.

64
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,420
Aokiji refused to serve under Akainu...

65
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,110
so he left the Navy.

66
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,570
What?!

67
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,180
So, Aokiji isn't a marine any more?

68
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,340
Indeed.  Who knows where he is now,
or what he's planning.

69
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,140
In any case, the Navy has lost a valuable asset.

70
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,090
But the Government has a plan to fill that power vacuum...

71
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,860
and it gives the Navy almost unthinkable power.

72
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,160
Listen up, all of you.  A lot of things have happened in the New World over the past two years,

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,970
but there are two changes in particular that you must keep in mind.

74
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
First of all, Navy HQ under Sakazuki's command...

75
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,340
has become an even more powerful force for justice.

76
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,570
The other...

77
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,720
is the rise of the Blackbeard Pirates!

78
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,570
Blackbeard?

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,760
The people we met in Mock Town, right?

80
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,790
The guys who once ravaged my homeland!

81
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,170
Long time no see, Straw Hat! {End copy-paste from 446}

82
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,790
He had been with the Whitebeard Pirates
for quite a while.

83
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,090
He was familiar with their territory, and after the Old Man died...

84
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,620
he went and took it over almost immediately.

85
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,120
And did it by using the very same Gura Gura power
he'd stolen from him.

86
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,070
Among society, he already ranks up with...

87
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,770
Red Hair...

88
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,960
Kaidou...

89
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,420
and Big Mom...

90
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,840
as one of the Four Emperors.

91
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,250
So he just snuck in and took Whitebeard's place.

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,250
What an insufferable guy.

93
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,740
He truly is a damnable man.

94
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,050
Rumor has it that they're out hunting Devil Fruit users.

95
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:28,660
I don't know how they do it, but they can kill Devil Fruit users and take their powers.

96
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,580
Blackbeard and his crew's goal is to
collect even stronger Devil Fruit powers.

97
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Be careful.

98
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm in danger!

99
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
I don't think they need the Hito Hito Fruit.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,420
What?!

101
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,030
Luffy-kun, you have...

102
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,950
a lot of history with Blackbeard... with Teach.

103
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,070
You have to be...

104
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,250
Luffy!

105
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,480
Are you even listening?!

106
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,060
You're the captain, aren't you?!

107
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,210
You should at least pay attention
to the important parts!

108
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh, don't worry about it, Jinbe.  We all heard it.

109
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,350
Huh?  You mean a captain isn't
someone who ignores everything people say?

110
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,770
Being the captain means you're responsible
for the lives of your crewmates, does it not, Luffy?!

111
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,890
Nah, Jinbe, just take it easy.

112
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,740
I like to leave it to chance, after all.

113
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm sure this has been hard on all of you.

114
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Absolutely.

115
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,180
Oh, Caimie!

116
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,910
Come to think of it, I don't see Weak-Hoshi around.

117
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,290
The Princess said she was a little tired
and wanted to rest.  She just went to her room.

118
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,360
Hey, Zoro!

119
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Sanji!

120
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,780
Is it just me...

121
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,160
or is there something like a wild animal in the palace?

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,970
Yeah.

123
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,920
It does feel like something's here.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Somebody!

125
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,150
Please don't do this!

126
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,570
Please just tell me who you are!

127
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,670
Somebody!  Anybody!

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,010
Don't make such a bitter face, Your Highness!

129
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,390
Don't worry, this isn't gonna hurt.

130
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,010
After I stole the treasure, selling mermaids seemed like more trouble than it's worth...

131
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,660
but you're a special case!

132
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,540
I just need you to go to sleep for a little while!

133
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,460
My brother and the others just let me know
that they've arrived here!

134
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,300
Let's go to the New World together!

135
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Hey.

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,490
Come on, let's see a smile.

137
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,600
Licky-licky.  Licky-licky.  Licky-licky.  Leee!

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,250
Hey!

139
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,020
Straw Hat?!

140
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,100
Luffy-sama!

141
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,130
That guy was still here?

142
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,640
Luffy-sama!

143
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,050
I was so terrified!

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,610
You're so damn lucky, Luffy!

145
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,930
I should have kicked him, dammit!

146
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,340
That was so close!  Once again, we are in your debt.

147
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,620
Don't sweat it.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,230
I can't believe that treasure thief was still in the castle.

149
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,070
Usually, not even a single minnow
could find its way into the castle...

150
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,570
but the gate was left open
during the chaos of the battle.

151
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,410
Look!  The tower to the right was cut clean in half!

152
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,870
I'm sure it was the treasure thief
who took advantage of our absence and...

153
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,940
No, it was this guy who cut the tower.

154
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,740
When they were escaping from the cage, he showed off by cutting the bars and the room clean in half.

155
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,360
Let him take the blame, you dumb starfish!

156
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,780
What's with you?!
Lying is the first step to becoming a thief!

157
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,200
Wait a second, Right Minister-chan!

158
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,460
Chan?

159
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,570
What do you mean, treasure thief?!

160
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,420
It's just what it sounds like.
That man stole all the treasure in the palace.

161
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,300
Huh, that guy?

162
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,340
I've got a bad feeling about this...

163
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,950
Those are your country's treasures, right?!  Aren't you gonna go after him?

164
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,970
Compared to the lives of all our citizens, the treasure is completely insignificant.

165
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,900
Like hell it is!

166
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,060
So, if we take it back...

167
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,210
It would be my honor to bestow the treasure
upon our country's saviors.

168
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,590
Really?

169
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,430
Hey you!  Why'd you send him flying?!

170
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,120
Why didn't you just knock him out
and tie him up here?!

171
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,170
Even when she's angry, Nami-san is still-

172
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,310
Go find him, right now!

173
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,110
Your Majesty!

174
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,060
Something's happened to Hody and his crew!  And their handcuffs have come off!

175
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,910
What?!

176
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,330
Humans!  Our malice will not end...

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,250
The time of our revenge will still come.

178
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,970
Bring Straw Hat to me... I will kill him.

179
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,680
Am I drunk?  My joints hurt...{ Btwb: Placed an ellipsis here since it does sound like he trails off. }

180
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,290
I got old on purpose.

181
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,790
First, we will get revenge on the Straw Hats -fosun...

182
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,240
We will bestow judgment upon the humans.

183
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,820
What is all this?!

184
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,040
Is this really Hody's crew?!

185
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,930
Don't think you can keep me in a cage,
you dumb king!

186
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,540
T-These bars...

187
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,920
Captain Hody!

188
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,750
How can this be?!

189
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,560
As I thought, the Energy Steroids you've been using...

190
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,470
were the pills from the legendary Tamate Box, right?!

191
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,440
Tamate Box?

192
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,120
A national treasure passed down
through the generations on Fishman Island -jamon.

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,550
The truth is, ten years ago...

194
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,510
there was an incident when
the contents of the Tamate Box were stolen.

195
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,000
We didn't know who was responsible, and His Majesty decided to keep it secret to avoid panic.

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,730
Now that I think about it,

197
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,730
it happened when you left the army, Hody!

198
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,450
That's right.  I stole them.

199
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,030
You fools.

200
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,210
Even the legends are unclear what those pills do.

201
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,060
Some legends claim that they can
give you the power of a thousand men,

202
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,740
others say that they just make you old.

203
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,250
As far as a national treasure go, they're rather peculiar.

204
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm guessing that they're just a vile drug, and were heavily guarded to prevent the dangerous effects.

205
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,380
You opened a box that should have never been opened,

206
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,760
gained some power,
and became deluded with grandeur -jamon.

207
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,760
Shut up, Neptune!

208
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,870
You'll never be able to
carry out your revenge like this.

209
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,560
Shut up!

210
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,710
We are the destined avengers!

211
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,630
We will definitely slaughter...

212
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,010
both you and the humans!

213
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,770
Now that it's come to this, I pity you.
I'll have to reconsider your punishment.

214
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,770
Fukaboshi, you're a disgrace to our species!

215
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,680
You killed my mother,
but I bear no grudge against you.

216
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,250
So please...  Be quiet now.

217
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,870
We mustn't let our island's children hear you.

218
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,640
Left Minister!

219
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,440
Sir Pekoms and Baron Tamago are at the Candy Factory!

220
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,350
Big Mom's subordinates... are here now?!

221
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,280
We have no candy to offer her this month.

222
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Hody and his crew destroyed the factory,

223
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,620
and everyone wanted to give the candy that wasn't destroyed to the Straw Hats...

224
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,390
so we took it to the banquet!

225
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,840
I don't know if excuses will be enough.

226
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,530
We're dealing with a monster
who's willing to destroy whole countries over candy!

227
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,180
One of the Four Emperors...

228
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,520
Big Mom!

229
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,140
The feast has been properly enjoyed, and has come to a proper close.

230
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,900
What?!  We can have the treasure?!

231
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,250
Amazing!

232
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,710
Well ain't that fortunate?

233
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,740
Will Luffy-sama and the others be alright,
Nami-chin-sama?

234
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,890
Yeah, don't worry about them.

235
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,820
We're making it big
just as we break into the New World!

236
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,080
Is life really that simple?

237
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,150
Hey, Usopp!  Why don't we go look, too?

238
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,730
We really shouldn't.  Upon checking, I found out...

239
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,410
that my bounty is over two hundred million beli!

240
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,110
Huh?  But I'm still only worth fifty.

241
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,110
Hey, look, Zoro and Sanji!

242
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,830
There he is!  That was easy!

243
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,250
So your punch already knocked him out?
How boring.

244
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,830
This is an impressive pile!

245
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,820
Is the shaggy king really going to
give all of this to us?

246
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,970
Awesome!  I'll be able to buy tons of meat with this!

247
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,010
He really had all of this
stored inside that swampy body of his?

248
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,190
Heave-ho!

249
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,190
Alright, back to Ryuuguu Palace!

250
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,530
How?

251
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,870
We'll need a flying fish.

252
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,140
Which way to town, Zoro?

253
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,290
Over there.

254
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,990
Okay then, we go the other way!

255
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,950
Hey!

256
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,370
Now then, Left Minister...

257
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,030
Is it too much to ask
for some sort of leniency this one time?

258
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,480
The factory was unexpectedly attacked by Hody's crew, so...

259
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,430
Your little rebellion has nothing to do with us -gao!

260
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,040
I was planning to take a little taste for myself,
and now I'm starving!

261
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,890
You give us an offering of candy once a month,

262
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,120
and we give you Mama's name to protect you!

263
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,810
Wasn't that the deal?!

264
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,180
We're business partners, so I didn't want to say this...

265
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,330
but you know how terrifying Mama is, don't you?!

266
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,030
Make her mad, and you'll...

267
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,020
be annihilated!

268
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,410
He's so cute when he makes threats.

269
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,680
Pay your protection -gao!

270
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,820
There's a crowd over there!

271
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,430
This is the Candy Factory that Pappagg talked about!

272
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,770
Really?  I hope there are some flying fish here.

273
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,470
This must be where they made
all that delicious candy we had earlier!

274
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,930
Hey, Candy Factory!

275
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,580
Oh, it's Straw Hat Luffy!

276
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,200
Luffy-san!  Is the feast over?

277
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,650
Luffy-kun!  What are you doing here?!

278
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,570
Yeah!  I'm stuffed!

279
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,790
The meat was great too,
but the candy from Fishman Island is just the best!

280
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,370
What?!

281
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,980
Uh... Straw Hat-san...

282
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,510
Don't tell them that!

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,200
Ah!  Mr. Droopy Mustache!  You're here too?!

284
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,820
Did he just say candy?!  Who's this guy?!

285
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,690
Right!  That's Straw Hat Luffy!  No doubt about it.

286
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,000
What's such a famous pirate doing here?

287
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,230
Uh, well...

288
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,380
Hey, kid!  What did you say about the candy?!

289
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,600
No, Sir Pekoms, you see...

290
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Who're you?  You're not a fishman.

291
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,210
Did you come to buy candy?

292
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,820
I just ate until my stomach was about to burst!

293
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,330
What?!

294
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,590
What is the meaning of this?!
He's saying he ate all the candy!

295
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,130
Uh, well, you see... There is a reason for...

296
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,050
Huh?  A talking lion!

297
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,420
Well, whatever.
We've got a similar guy in our crew too.

298
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,770
Pekoms.

299
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,050
Recklessly threatening everyone
won't necessarily help us collect the candy.

300
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,190
Let us find a peaceful solution to this -soir.

301
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,640
The tea party isn't for another four days -bon.

302
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,910
If we set off tomorrow morning, we can still make it -jour.

303
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,140
Another weirdo.  Who are you?

304
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,660
Bon day to you.
I am a soft-boiled member of our pirate crew.

305
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,160
I go by the name of Baron Tamago -soir.

306
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,160
{\an8}Tamago: Egg

307
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,700
Egg?

308
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,810
Please remember my name, at least -s'il vous plait.

309
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,380
Incidentally, my dear fellows...

310
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:03,220
Did you just say something about eating
all the candy this factory produced -c'est si bon?

311
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,410
What is he, a compass?

312
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,100
That's right.  I'd love to eat more if they had any!

313
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,520
And it is precisely because they don't that we are in this quandary -bon.

314
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:23,320
That mark up on the factory is the flag of our boss,
the great pirate Charlotte Linlin -soir.

315
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,650
That flag marks this island
as part of the Emperor Big Mom's territory.

316
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,230
Meaning!  Fishman Island is being protected by Big Mom's name -bon!

317
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,110
She must be nice!  I'd love to meet her!

318
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,080
Big Mom, huh?

319
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,800
Make no mistake.  This is just business!

320
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,100
Ten tons of candy per month.

321
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,050
That is the price they must pay to fly that flag -bon.

322
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Ten tons?!

323
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,320
Indeed.  Mama loves sweets
more than anything else -soir.

324
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,700
Fishman Island candy in particular, is her favorite.

325
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,390
So we will wait until tomorrow morning.

326
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,460
No, no, Baron... Like I was just saying,
all the ovens in the factory are broken...

327
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,160
and it'll take several days to repair them,
so at least give us two weeks to-

328
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,800
No can do -soir.

329
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,720
Hey, Egg!  Why can't you just wait?!

330
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,900
How could one of the Four Emperors be such a small balled bastard?

331
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,720
She is no bastard!
Mama is a great female pirate -vous plait.

332
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,400
She does not have any balls at all -jour.

333
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,940
So she's a Madame?

334
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,970
I love candy... and you too, since you can make it.

335
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,810
So, what happens
if she doesn't get the candy on time?

336
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,190
If that happens...

337
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,650
our agreement will be null and void!

338
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:11,260
And in a few short days, Big Mom will send
valiant warriors to destroy Fishman Island -vous plait!

339
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,490
Destroy Fishman Island?!

340
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,600
What are you, stupid?!
You think I'll let this country fall because of candy?!

341
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,250
We just saved this island!

342
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,730
You seem happy, Mama.

343
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm looking forward to the tea party in four days!

344
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,250
I'll be able to eat that delicious candy from Fishman Island again!

345
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,130
I'm so excited, my stomach acid is just gushing out.

346
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,590
So excited!  So excited!  Fishman Island candy!

347
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,240
You're looking forward to it too?

348
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,930
But of course!  That candy is a masterpiece!

349
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,780
Then... you can look forward to it from inside my gut!

350
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,670
Mama!

351
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,550
I'm back!

352
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,470
Right... So how did it go, Bobbin?

353
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,930
We took care of 'em, then burned it down!

354
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:08,000
Good.  That country's baked sweets were the best!

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,070
I'm sure the burning country must have smelled nice?

356
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,840
It's too bad, but it couldn't be helped.

357
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,720
They failed to deliver the promised sweets, after all.

358
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,830
Got any snacks?

359
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,870
Anyone who won't give me candy must be killed.

360
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,490
I hate people who tell me
they'll give it to me and then don't!

361
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,670
I hate them as much as bitter candy!

362
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,900
Speaking of which...

363
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,050
Apparently Fishman Island might not
be able to deliver the candy for this month.

364
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,200
Pekoms just contacted me.

365
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,500
Should we burn down Fishman Island, too?

366
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,610
The candy from Fishman Island isn't coming?!

367
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,830
Get me the Snail Phone right now!

368
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,100
It must be Mama -gao!

369
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,170
I just explained the situation to her.

370
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,320
A... A message from Big Mom herself?!

371
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,540
Hey, Pekoms!

372
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,420
You answer it -gao!  I don't want her to yell at me!

373
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,880
Hello?!

374
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
Hey!

375
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,840
Whaaaaat?!

376
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,720
Are you Big Mom?!

377
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

378
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,440
You're not Tamago, nor Pekoms.

379
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,400
Who are you?!

380
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,010
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!
The man who will become the Pirate King!

381
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

382
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,430
Luffy-kun!

383
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,160
Straw Hat-san!

384
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,310
Monkey... D?

385
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,400
Ah, Garp's grandson?

386
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,240
Now I remember!

387
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,400
You're that kid who caused a ruckus during the war two years ago, right?

388
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,140
There's no candy here!

389
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,030
I ate all of it!

390
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,630
There really isn't any at all?!
There was supposed to be ten tons of it!

391
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,140
I ate all ten tons!

392
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,130
Straw Hat-san, you don't have to do this!

393
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,630
What is he trying to do?!

394
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,740
What an idiot you are!  Don't lie to me!

395
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,460
You're covering for the fishmen, aren't you?

396
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,610
But it's true that I ate it!

397
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,030
I didn't know it was promised to someone else.

398
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,800
We've got tons of treasure here.

399
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,830
I'll give all of it to you as compensation for the candy!

400
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,230
Treasure?!

401
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,330
Huh?!  As if I could eat treasure!

402
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,020
I want to eat sweet candy!

403
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,440
Hey, wait a second!  Is that all treasure?!

404
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,360
Yup.

405
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,970
Mama, this is Tamago speaking!  Let's think about this calmly!

406
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:33,690
A few days days ago, that brat, Captain Kid, sunk two ships that we were supposed to protect -bon!

407
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:40,070
They lost a lot of money.  To tell the truth, we've been needing a little money to settle that problem -bon!

408
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,490
Just this once, the smart choice would be
to wait another two weeks for the candy,

409
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,130
and accept this treasure
as an apology for their blunder -jour!

410
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,210
As for your sweets, we'll pick up the sweetest and most savory we can find on our way back.

411
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,400
You gotta be kidding me, Tamago!

412
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,440
How dare you say such a disgraceful thing.

413
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,850
What pirate would ever accept a compromise for the things she wants?!

414
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,850
I- I'm soiry!

415
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,200
Although...

416
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,570
this brat who's willing to stand up to me
has piqued my interest.

417
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,720
As you wish, just this once...

418
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,640
I'll change my target from Fishman Island to you!

419
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,830
Monkey D. Luffy...

420
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,290
I'll remember you. { tlc: It's because I remember you. }

421
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,850
Come, to the New World!

422
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,960
Luffy-kun!

423
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,040
Sure.  Just you wait!

424
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,030
I've got something to settle with you now.

425
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,040
Huh?

426
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,760
You're too dangerous to trust!

427
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,630
I'll kick your ass in the New World...

428
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,670
and make Fishman Island my turf!
