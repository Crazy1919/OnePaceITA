1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,360
Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,860
His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,630
All my wealth and treasure?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,270
It can be yours if you want!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,420
Search for it!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,830
I left everything in that one place.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,820
People now set sail in search of romance.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,100
Run!

10
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,880
Huh?!

11
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,270
What is this?!

12
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,900
Everyone is taking evasive action!

13
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,770
{\an5}The General From the Future Land and
The Crisis of Fishman Island's Destruction

14
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,730
They must be afraid of our military strength!

15
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,860
Now then, let's target the enemy commanders while we have the chance!

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,350
Forward!

17
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,470
Hey, Commander Chopper!

18
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,680
The vehicle is trembling!  There must be something wrong!

19
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,590
It's a pitfall!

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,700
Serves you right!

21
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,810
How'd you like that?! { tlc: I didn't hear any line here. }

22
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,190
{\an8}Sure-Kill Daruma Drop

23
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,310
Ow...

24
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,570
I just used my fangs to dig the ground full of holes!

25
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,740
Hey!  What's going on?!

26
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,200
Usopp?!  Chopper?!

27
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,580
Now, I'm gonna drop that idiot on the bike as well...

28
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,020
Oh, crap!

29
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,330
It's a pitfall!

30
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,340
Is he a complete bonehead?!

31
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,560
H-Hey!  Are you alright?!

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,570
Damn you!  This is super-unforgivable!

33
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,720
Everyone out!

34
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,150
Why?!

35
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,070
Hey!  What are you doing, Franky?!

36
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,450
Why'd you throw the tank commander out?!

37
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,900
Because this is a one-man vehicle!

38
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,250
Time to transform!

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,260
{\an8}Hentai: Transform or Pervert

40
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,170
You already are a pervert!

41
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,240
Black Rhino FR-U 4!

42
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,360
Stand by!

43
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,620
A transformation!

44
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm not done yet!

45
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,320
Brachio Tank 5!

46
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,280
Head Change!

47
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,040
Brachio Tank 5!  Black Rhino FR-U 4!

48
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,700
Docking!

49
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,570
What?!  Docking?!

50
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,470
Iron Pirate!

51
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,500
General Franky!

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,170
Alriiiiiight!

53
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,650
What the hell is that?!

54
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,860
Awesome!

55
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,540
Yay!  Yay!

56
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,190
It's the mecha combination of our dreams!

57
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,230
Vegapunk, you genius I never met.

58
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,780
I saw the theoretical design that you had sketched... {Swashy-B: This text shows up a little later than when he started to speak @ about 11:47}

59
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,480
and spent two grueling years of trial and error working on it.

60
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,900
By making use of
the shape-adapting alloy, Wapometal, { tlc: memory-structure alloy }{ def: i'm not in a position to judge the translation merits of the tlc, but i like the sound of shape-adapting better }

61
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,550
I've made it a reality!

62
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,040
D-Don't be fooled by his bluff!

63
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,430
So strong!

64
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,660
Don't be impressed yet!

65
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,100
Have a good look...

66
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,600
at the Sword of the Plunderer!

67
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,610
Fransword!

68
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,730
A sword!

69
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,590
{\an8}Ashimoto: Soles

70
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,920
Attacking from below?!

71
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,500
That's cheap!  It's too dangerous!


72
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,110
Now that you're in the air,
my shoulder cannons will attack you!

73
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,760
Shoulder cannons?!

74
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
You're the one firing them?!

75
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,680
Nevertheless...

76
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,680
Nevertheless...

77
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,140
You're so cool!

78
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,900
Damn!

79
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,970
What a tricky guy!

80
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,690
{\an8}Omomi: Weight

81
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,980
We're being crushed!

82
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,900
You're so cool, General!

83
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,870
How is that cool?!

84
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,030
What is this?

85
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,820
Have I found some weaklings? { def: i made this a question because it ended in -ka .  i love second guessing the translator in a language i don't speak =P }

86
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,630
Weak?  How rude!

87
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,290
I'm just a scaredy cat, that's all!

88
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,380
Be careful of gusts.

89
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,360
Do you understand now?

90
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,290
This is the weather science of Weatheria.

91
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,840
Don't underestimate it!

92
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,030
Eh?  Huh?

93
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,860
Where'd Chopper go?

94
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,030
Get him!

95
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,120
Damn it... I was thrown out of the tank.

96
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,950
Guess I've got no choice but to fight.

97
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,540
But there's no reason to fear!

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,130
I'm not the same weakling that I used to be!

99
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,520
{\an8}Bamboo Javelin-Grove

100
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,030
Heracles'n-sensei!

101
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,180
I spent two years in that forest, fighting for my life.

102
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,980
I couldn't drop my guard for a second!

103
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,440
I won't forget that!

104
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,910
Now it begins!

105
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,910
The second chapter of Usopp the Man's Adventure!

106
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,320
I'll rig the entire plaza with pitfalls!

107
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,780
They can bring robots or whatever they want.

108
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,620
When they're trapped in a hole, it's all over for them!

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,020
What?

110
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,640
I can hear someone else digging through the earth...

111
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,450
Daruma-san went flying!

112
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,250
W-Who are you?!

113
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,190
It's me!

114
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm good at digging through the earth too!

115
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Chopper!

116
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,600
Awesome!  You've learned how to turn into a stag beetle?!

117
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,130
I'm not a beetle!

118
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,330
I improved my transformation points over the past two years.

119
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,120
Now only one of my transformations needs a Rumble Ball.

120
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
I can change into all the other forms whenever I want!

121
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,790
You cheeky coral bastard!

122
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,020
I'll tear you to shreds!

123
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,730
This isn't coral, they're horns!

124
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,790
And I...

125
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,780
am a cheeky monster!

126
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,350
How many did you kill?

127
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,270
Z-Zero...

128
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,320
Kraken!

129
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,710
Well done, I didn't think you had it in you.

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,910
They believed you and you captured Shirahoshi.

131
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Now crush her!

132
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,300
Your brothers still live in the North Pole.

133
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,650
I know exactly where they are.

134
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,790
We could kill them any time we like.

135
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,420
You are legendary creatures...

136
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,480
so even your corpses should fetch a high price,
don't you think?

137
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,430
Are you telling me that's what you want...

138
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,780
Kraken?

139
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,250
Unbelievable... He's been forcing him to obey
by threatening his siblings?

140
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm telling you for the last time!  Crush Shirahoshi!

141
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,020
Surume-sama!  I-I can't breathe!

142
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,450
Surume!

143
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,500
You became his slave... to protect your siblings?

144
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,620
I see, of course you want to protect them.

145
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,070
Are they your younger siblings?  Or older?

146
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,980
Let me protect them too!

147
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,750
Here comes Straw Hat!

148
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,250
Kill him!

149
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,010
You can't -dogon!

150
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,880
Leave it to us -hi!

151
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,020
Straw Hat!

152
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,530
I won't let you get to our captain -hi!

153
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,520
You're mine!

154
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,970
I won't let you...

155
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,340
Get in his way!

156
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,950
Stop Straw Hat!

157
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,390
Huh?  He disappeared!

158
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,290
What?!

159
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,080
Now I'm really fired up!

160
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,480
Oh no!

161
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,610
That is...

162
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,300
the ship of promise...

163
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,050
Noah!

164
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,780
W-Why...

165
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,290
Why is it moving?!

166
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,960
Who'd do this... and how?!

167
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
T-This is terrible!

168
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,010
What is it, Father?

169
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes, this is strange, but why are you so upset?

170
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,780
It's just some old wreckage.  It isn't important.

171
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,770
You're wrong.
We mustn't let anything happen to that ship -jamon!

172
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,400
The ship must not be moved
before its time has come -jamon!

173
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,130
Captain Hody!

174
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,870
He took so many Energy Steroids
that he turned into a monster, but still...

175
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,260
N-No, look!

176
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,050
Straw Hat!

177
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,850
He sure is tough.

178
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,610
Do you have any idea what Fishman Karate can do?!

179
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,490
He took his head right off!

180
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,390
Alright!  And it only took one hit!

181
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,010
That won't work on me...

182
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,430
'cause I'm rubber!

183
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,040
Compared to Jinbe's attacks, that didn't even itch!

184
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,170
That's right!  It's because you rely on fake power!

185
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,310
{\an8}Head Armament

186
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,090
Steel Shell Squadron!

187
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,790
You fool!  Your head's gonna shatter!

188
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,890
{\an8}Bell

189
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,610
Steel lost to his head!

190
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,380
None of them are hitting?!

191
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,830
Does he know where every single one is going?!

192
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,960
You're amazing, Luffy-sama!

193
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,920
That's the Haki of Perception!

194
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,290
Captain Hody!

195
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,670
Luffy-sama... How strong are you?

196
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,720
Straw Hat Luffy is amazing!

197
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,850
So this is the power of a world-famous pirate?

198
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,330
Whaaat?!

199
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,620
T-That's...

200
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,670
the Noah, from the Fishman District!

201
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,230
Why is the Noah above Fishman Island?!

202
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,180
It's clearly falling toward the plaza!

203
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,540
It's going to break the bubble around the island!

204
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,620
Fishman Island will be destroyed without the bubble!

205
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,940
We'll all be washed away!

206
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,080
What's that?!

207
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Noah?!

208
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,780
It's super-huge!

209
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,960
If that ship hits us, the entire island will be crushed!

210
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,220
Who's steering it?!

211
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,750
No, the Noah shouldn't even have the power to move!

212
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,450
What is that?!

213
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,400
It's huge!

214
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,970
I don't know what's happening, but we're doomed!

215
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,430
I wonder, if we're all crushed at the same time...

216
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,550
will the ocean become red?

217
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,430
Don't jinx us by saying such horrible things!

218
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,490
Evacuate!

219
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,310
Flee to the waters outside the island!

220
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,300
E-Everyone...

221
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
What is that?

222
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,140
Owie... I slipped.

223
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,810
You're... Decken's subordinate, Wadatsumi!

224
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,260
Cap'n Vander Decken!

225
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,190
I fell off!

226
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,410
Pwease stop da ship!

227
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,750
I don' wanna die!

228
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,710
Decken?!  What is going on?!

229
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,790
Captain Hody!

230
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you alright?!

231
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,340
Uh, is this... part of the plan?!

232
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,170
It looks like Decken is moving that ship!

233
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,270
Be quiet, you useless worms!

234
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,270
Damn Straw Hat...

235
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,160
Huh?  How is he still standing?

236
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,070
I even attacked him using the Color of Arms.

237
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,750
Decken, is it?  That insane pirate!

238
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,710
This wasn't part of the plan!

239
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,030
Shirahoshi!

240
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,080
Accept... my love!

241
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,440
Cap'n Decken!  What 'bout me?!

242
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,960
Wadatsumi?

243
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,420
It's no longer possible to save you!

244
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,270
You will become a sacrifice for the death
of Shirahoshi, just like the rest of Fishman Island!

245
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,330
No way!

246
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,080
We're done for!  The bubble won't hold!

247
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,210
This is the end!

248
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,580
Hey, where'd Princess Shirahoshi go?

249
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,930
She's gone!

250
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,880
What?  The Princess!  Princess Shirahoshi!

251
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,440
What?  Shirahoshi disappeared?!

252
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
I-Impossible!

253
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm up here!

254
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,850
Princess Shirahoshi!

255
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,890
When did she...

256
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,830
Mermaid Princess?!

257
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,990
Shirahoshi!  What is she doing up there?!

258
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,280
Basically, that ship is flying at Shirahoshi!

259
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,510
The woman I love!

260
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,410
M-My life is your target, is it not?!

261
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,510
If you just want to take my life...

262
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,090
then the people of Ryuuguu Kingdom should not be caught up in it.

263
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,710
Please, leave them alone!

264
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,000
I am right here!

265
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,170
Princess!  Shirahoshi-sama!

266
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,510
So basically, that insane Decken-guy...

267
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,950
was planning to crush the whole island, and us with it.

268
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,120
He betrayed me!

269
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,880
Ah, she's going to sacrifice herself for us!

270
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
Isn't there anything we can do to help her?

271
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,570
Oh, how...

272
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,110
Oh, how completely beautiful you are, Shirahoshi!  Even your heart shines with it!

273
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,130
You're trying to avert this disaster
and save your country all by yourself, Shirahoshi?

274
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,860
Shirahoshi!

275
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,420
Shira... hoshi.

276
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,830
You truly are
worthy of becoming Vander Decken the Ninth's wife!

277
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,980
Die at the height of your beauty, and live on forever in my heart!

278
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,070
Shirahoshi!

279
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,060
Your Highness!

280
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,430
That Weak-hoshi...
Even after I told her to stay close to me!

281
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,190
Straw Hat is...

282
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,190
Captain Hody!

283
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,070
H-Huh?  Hody-san isn't here!

284
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,720
Look up in the sky!  There he is!

285
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,750
Under Noah?!

286
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,750
You're completely insane, Vander Decken.

287
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,550
However, this is a great trump card!

288
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,380
That bastard... How dare he harm Shirahoshi-chan?!

289
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,190
Sanji, wait!

290
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,090
I'll jump up there!  You take care of the plaza!

291
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,590
Got it!

292
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,830
But anyway Luffy, the ship is underwater!

293
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,840
Do you think there's water inside the ship too, Jinbe?

294
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,410
I'm not sure, but Decken is a Devil Fruit user...

295
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,210
so we can assume that there must be air in there somewhere since he can make the ship move.

296
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,020
If you're going to go, take this.

297
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,150
It's a coral that creates a bubble.

298
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,860
Okay!

299
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay, I leave my beloved Shirahoshi-chan to you!

300
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,030
I'm gonna fling you, Luffy!

301
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,890
Do it!
