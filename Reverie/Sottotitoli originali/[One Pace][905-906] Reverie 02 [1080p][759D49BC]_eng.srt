1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,190
{\an8}The Great Pirate Era...

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,940
{\an8}has proven to be a more tumultuous storm than the World Government expected.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,660
{\an8}The figures in the eye of this relentless tempest are...

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,870
{\an8}Monkey D. Luffy...

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
{\an8}and the Straw Hat Pirates!

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,380
{\an8}To confront the furious Great Pirate Era...

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,840
{\an8}fifty world leaders have come
together for the Reverie...

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,930
{\an8}a quadrennial conference that {is about to begin}will commence shortly.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,270
{\an8}Now is a time of great change.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,490
A Beautiful World

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,490
A Beautiful World

12
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,910
{\an8}Navy

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
{\an8}{This is}Here stands Fleet Admiral Sakazuki’s new Navy Headquarters:

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,250
{\an8}New Marineford.

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,300
{\an8}Two years ago, the forces of Navy Headquarters...

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,050
{\an8}triumphed over the Whitebeard Pirates 
during the Summit War.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,180
{\an8}However, the battlefield of Marineford suffered massive devastation.

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,560
{\an8}Though Marineford was long the seat of justice,

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,530
{\an8}the World Government built 
an even more impregnable fortress...

20
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,280
{\an8}to prepare for the rising fury of the Pirate Era.

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,580
{\an8}This {new}latest fort of justice
at the entry to the New World...

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,450
{\an8}is New Marineford.

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,540
{Fujitora is in Mary Geoise?!}Fujitora actually showed his face in Mary Geoise?!

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,380
Y-Yes, sir!

25
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,130
I told him to stay away from all naval bases...

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,510
until he {brings}brought me Straw Hat's and Law’s heads!

27
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,720
I won't hear any lip about how
he forgot what I told him on Dressrosa!

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,730
Oh, scary!

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,310
{How dare he come back! That fool!}How dare he come slinking back! 
That mongrel!

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,440
Y-Yes, sir, we all know what you told him.{..}

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,530
{Then why didn't you send him away?!}Then why didn't you send him packing?!

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,400
Well...

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,620
{he made a perfectly logical argument and...}{H}he had an airtight counterargument, {and we had no response...}and we had no rebuttal.

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,750
This is not a naval base.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,250
That's just a technicality!

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,500
That damned vagabond monk!

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,840
Oh?

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,050
{Isn't it a difficult job?}Difficult job, isn't it,

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,680
Fleet Admiral?

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,640
S-Sengoku-san !

41
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,560
{Shut up}Butt out, you semi-retired has-been!

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,820
Who else has gone to Mary Geoise?!

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,190
A-Admiral Ryokugyu-san !

44
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,280
Ryokugyu, huh?

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,160
Contact him immediately!

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,700
Yes, sir! What should I tell him?!

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,710
That should be obvious!
Tell him to turn Fujitora away if he sees him!

48
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,250
All of you, go!

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,170
Y-Yes, sir!

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,720
{What a bunch of idiots!}Idiots! Every one of them!{I LOVE this change.}

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,180
{Why don't you return to your post too?!}And why aren't you also returning to your post?!

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,600
It's strange, isn't it?
Straw Hat's bounty...

53
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,560
went up to 1.5 billion.

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,020
They say he's the fifth emperor of the sea!

55
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,070
I'm amazed!

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,420
Do you see it? The maelstrom keeps growing.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,800
It was still {insignificant}negligible two years ago.

58
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,720
But now the turbulence of the Great Pirate Era 
has {spread so far}rocked the whole world.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,930
One Piece...

60
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,150
does exist!

61
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
{It was nothing more than a dead man's stupid joke!}It was just a dead man's bad idea {for}of a joke!

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,410
That damn Whitebeard!

63
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,450
Every last one of them has fallen for his nonsense!

64
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,370
They don't know what it means to rebel against us!

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,460
I'll teach them!

66
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,290
{\an8}Despite its new location,

67
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,460
{\an8}New Marineford remains the gatekeeper...{ to...}

68
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,680
{\an8}to the Holy Land of Mary Geoise, 
the home of the Celestial Dragons.

69
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,770
{\an8}The place where the Summit War was fought is now Branch G-1.

70
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,020
{\an8}The two naval bases are situated
on both sides of the Red Line...

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,820
Okay, Shirahoshi.

to be as fair as Pirate Empress Hancock!

2221
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,730

2222
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,690

{\an8}{Sterry is the adopted son of Sabo’s noble parents.}Sterry became nobility 
when he was adopted by Sabo's parents.{Gaijin, using "noble" as an adjective to describe Sabo's parents isn't exactly wrong, as they are nobles, but just saying that someone is "noble" carries a more virtuous meaning outside of any other context. Sabo's parents are anything but virtuous. Hopefully my rearranging of the words here doesn't mess with the original Japanese too much.}

Father{-sama}, I...

3688
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,210
If possible, I want to live {on land}up on the surface!

3689

3704
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,860
We no longer need 
the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

3705
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,450
You're crazy! {I mean it!}For real!

3706

none of the families attending will get bored-fa-mi-re-do !

3792
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,010
We love samba more than anything!
Would you like to dance with us?! Samba!

3793
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,390
I'd be happy to! King of Samba! Mambo!

3794
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,640
Mambo, mambo! Shake, shake!

3795
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,640
Samba, samba! Shake, shake!

3796
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,610
Even Father is enjoying himself. That's a relief.

3797
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,400
U-Um...

3798
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,320
E-{e}Everyone-sama ?

3799
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,200
O, {my}dear princess from under the sea!
{Your beauty is as breathtaking as I've heard!}The rumors do your beauty justice!

3800
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,080
{Would you like to meet my son}Please consider him as a suitor!
He's royalty and single!

3801
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,130
Papan{Nope, definitely there}{Gaijin, is this a typo? I can't hear the "n" sound at the end, but I could be missing it}! {She's not half-bad!}Not bad. Not bad at all!

3802
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,670
U-Um...

3803
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,050
{Princess-sama}Your Royal Highness,
{we also have 
a royal son who is available!}our royal-born son is also available!

3804
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,550
P-Pappy! I like her!

3805
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,090
Um... uh...

3806
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,970
No, {Mermaid Princess}Your Royal Highness!
{Please meet my royal son!}Please consider my royal-born son!

3807
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,060
{We have three handsome royal princes!}Our royal family has three handsome sons!

3808
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,570
Now, which royal suitor do you like?!

3809
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,190
Oh, um... uh...

3810
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,530
Um... well...

3811
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,790
None of you are my type!

3812
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,500
What?! Even though they're royalty?!

3813
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Shirahoshi!

3814
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,500
How dare you! This is humiliating!

3815
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,180
No, {she}my sister was saying "I'm not married, either."
That is, in an undersea dialect...

3816
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,390
Brother Ryuboshi?!

3817
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,640
When this happens, just say "How lovely" 
or "Let's have dinner sometime,"

3818
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,270
and turn them down {softly}gracefully, Shirahoshi!

3819
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,400
{I could never tell a lie…}But then I'd be lying...

3820
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,030
It's just dodging, not lying!

3821
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,990
If you upset someone, it could become
{a diplomatic issue}an international incident-fa-mi-re-do ! Let's go!

3822
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,740
How cute!

3823
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,370
Princess Vivi and Karoo{, }
{t}{The }Kingdom of Arabasta

3824
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,370
Princess Vivi and Karoo{, }
{t}{The }Kingdom of Arabasta

3825
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,370
You're so cute! You're like a fairy!

3826
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,040
That's not a compliment to a warrior!

3827
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,040
Commander Leo{, }
Tonta Corps{ Commander}
 Tontatta Tribe

3828
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,040
Commander Leo{, }
Tonta Corps{ Commander}
 Tontatta Tribe

3829
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Bian

3830
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Bian

3831
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Kabu

3832
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Kabu

3833
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Mansherry

3834
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Mansherry

3835
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,420
Are you okay, Leo?!

3836
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,970
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend!

3837
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,470
What?!

3838
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,800
{Then, that's okay!}In that case, it's fine!

3839
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,640
Oh good! She seems nice!

3840
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,600
You're really quick. I wouldn't have 
noticed you if it weren't for Karoo.

3841
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,480
I showed myself because I heard you say you knew Luffyland.

3842
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,820
We're subordinates of Luffyland's crew!
We're pirates!

3843
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,120
Pirates?!

3844
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,700
So cute!

3845
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,540
{Nice to meet you}It's nice meet you, Leo-san !

3846
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,790
Nice to meet you{,} too!

3847
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,330
I never thought I'd be able to talk
so much about Lucy at the Reverie.

3848
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,090
{But I suppose they're traveling around the world.}But it only makes sense if they're traveling the world.

3849
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Rebecca{, }
A Dressrosan Lady-in-Waiting

3850
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Rebecca{, }
A Dressrosan Lady-in-Waiting

3851
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,760
Did Lucy visit your country, Vivi-san?

3852
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,090
No, I mean, did Luffy?

3853
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,430
That's right! Luffyland!

3854
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,060
Yes.

3855
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,020
My home country, Arabasta,
only exists today...

3856
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,100
thanks to them.

3857
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,230
{\an8}Princess Vivi {of}hails from Arabasta,
the Kingdom of Sand in the Grand Line,

3858
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:17,160
{\an8}{is a friend of the Straw Hats 
that sailed with them in the past.}and years ago became friends with the Straw Hats, 
even sailing with them for some time.

3859
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,000
{All right! At any rate, no matter what happens,
this thing on our left arms...}All right! Anyway, no matter what happens,
our left arms...{Flashback: match with Arabasta 1}

3860
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,540
{is the sign of our friendship!}prove we're definitely crewmates!

3861
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,000
{\an8}In order to take control of the country,
the former warlord...

3862
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,010
{\an8}Sir Crocodile instigated a civil war...

3863
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,300
{\an8}between the Royal Army and the Rebellion.

3864
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,520
Please... stop fighting! {Flashback: check with later Arabasta episodes.}

3865
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,690
Please stop fighting!

3866
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,990
Please don't fight... anymore!!

3867
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,330
Our nightmares... are all over{…}.

3868
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,920
{\an8}Luffy and his crew foiled Crocodile’s plot...

3869
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,580
{\an8}and saved the Kingdom of Arabasta.

3870
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,460
{\an8}However, the Straw Hats didn't get the credit,

3871
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,880
{\an8}{because}as the government reported that
it was the Navy's achievement.

3872
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,970
Since they never want to be seen as heroes{...},

3873
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:26,100
{they've gotten a bad name because of the reputation 
that comes with having a bounty, but...}they {instead }received bounties 
and earned infamy instead of fame.

3874
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,310
I'm sure they haven't changed.

3875
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,520
When I read about Dressrosa,

3876
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,900
I knew that Luffy-san and the others 
had decided to save somebody again!

3877
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,910
That's right!

3878
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,370
To us, Luffy...

3879
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,670
The Straw Hats mean the world to us.

3880
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,800
I miss Lucy.

3881
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,050
Um...

3882
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,390
Were you talking about Luffy-sama just now?

3883
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,060
Oh, the Mermaid Princess!

3884
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,440
Shirahoshi!

3885
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,110
Talking about him 
doesn't {always}mean they know him!

3886
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,730
Luffy-kun is a pirate!
No one can know he's your friend-la-ti-do !{Fun fact, but he's actually saying "la-si-do" here.}

3887
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,570
The Mermaid Princess knows Luffy-san ?

3888
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,320
Hey, did you {just }say Luffy-sama just now?

3889
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,330
Wait, Rebecca! If we heard wrong...

3890
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:26,910
Yes!

3891
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,830
I did! Do you know him?!

3892
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,580
Stop! Everyone knows his name!

3893
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,340
I'm deeply indebted to Luffy-sama.{..}

3894
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,470
So are we!

3895
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,490
Hey, Luffy-san sure eats a lot, doesn't he?

3896
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,160
Uh-huh!
He had an unbelievable appetite on Dressrosa!

3897
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,500
It was the same at Ryugu Palace{, too}.

3898
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,170
They're having fun.

3899
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,590
They really are.

3900
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:22,260
{It is good that those responsible for the future of their countries get along.}It's a good sign when those responsible
for the future of their countries get along.

3901
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,350
{Anyway}Although, it's a strange connection.

3902
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,600
Yes, {we have to thank
Straw Hat and the others.}it's all thanks to Straw Hat and his crew.

3903
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,600
Hey! Aren't you Rebecca from Dressrosa?!

3904
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,360
Oh, I know him!

3905
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,150
It's me, Sai!

3906
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,610
Don Sai{, }
The 13th Don of the Happo Navy

3907
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,610
Don Sai{, }
The 13th Don of the Happo Navy

3908
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,610
I didn't expect to see you again so soon!

3909
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,450
How have you been?!

3910
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,740
I'm doing fine!

3911
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,330
He’s from Kano’s Happo Navy.

3912
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,580
I heard he replaced Chinjao as leader.

3913
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,000
{He is}{So}Yes, he's the new don.

3914
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,170
Sai!

3915
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,380
{Oh}Hey there, Brother! {You're here, too}You came too, Leo!

3916
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,010
I'm a secret bodyguard!

3917
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,140
You're so reliable!

3918
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,600
Right?

3919
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Is he {your}a friend?

3920
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,400
We both swore an oath to Luffyland.

3921
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,850
Leo.

3922
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,530
Up until now I've been working for Kano,

3923
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,990
{but I'm gonna cut ties after I finish my role here as a bodyguard.}but I'm cutting ties 
once I finish up here as a bodyguard.

3924
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,620
This will be my last service for them.

3925
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,910
I'm deeply indebted to Straw Hat
and the others for saving us in Dressrosa.

3926
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,920
The Straw Hat Grand Fleet 
{has}numbers over 5,600 {troops in total.}total troops.

3927
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,050
{The seven of us representatives should be ready to help him at all times.}We seven representatives should
be ready to assist him at a moment's notice.

3928
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,170
Uh-huh.

3929
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,850
The others are preparing too.

3930
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,150
What did you say?!

3931
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,320
You're suddenly leaving
the Standing Kingdom?!

3932
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,070
{\an8}Resignation

3933
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,690
{Give me a reason!}Explain yourself!

3934
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,990
{I have to pay back a great debt!}I owe someone a great debt.

3935
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,280
Barrier!

3936
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,620
Barrier Crash!

3937
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,330
You put up a barrier by crossing your fingers.

3938
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,960
Even children know that!

3939
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,080
W-We surrender!

3940
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,630
We lose!
We'll serve under you, {so give us a break!}so spare us!

3941
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,220
Well then...

3942
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,680
Put this on.

3943
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,260
Wh-What is it?

3944
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,730
Let's all support the Straw Hats{ together}!

3945
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,940
Let's!

3946
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,110
Two unidentified ships are approaching!

3947
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,650
Are they remnants of Doflamingo's forces?

3948
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,030
Cavendish.

3949
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,950
As you may know,

3950
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,790
{I was formerly the prince of Bourgeois.}I'm the former prince of Bourgeois.

3951
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,960
Cavendish-sama !

3952
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,090
But all the women in the country
were crazy about me,

3953
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,180
and not a single one was
willing to marry another man.

3954
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,600
I was expelled from the country
for being too popular.

3955
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,810
So{...},

3956
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,190
we don't need to attack them
since they're not our enemies.

3957
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,610
Straw Hat is now sure to face...

3958
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,450
far more dangerous opponents than Doflamingo.

3959
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,370
We have to become stronger.

3960
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,460
{Yes! I'm training myself with my crew, too!}Yes! My crew and I are training too!

3961
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,420
I hope we can fight together for Luffyland again!

3962
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,750
Yeah!

3963
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,680
Well, well, Princess Vivi!

3964
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,890
Wapol!

3965
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,060
King Wapol{, the}
{The }Evil Kingdom of Black Drum

3966
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,060
King Wapol{, the}
{The }Evil Kingdom of Black Drum

3967
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,390
You hippo!

3968
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,730
Queen Kinderella{, }
{The }Evil Kingdom of Black Drum

3969
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,730
Queen Kinderella{, }
{The }Evil Kingdom of Black Drum

3970
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,690
{Why are you here?!}What are you doing here?!

3971
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,320
It must seem strange, right?
Sure, {I was sent flying...}Straw Hat Luffy...

3972
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,120
{by Straw Hat Luffy, to a distant sea!}sent me flying to a distant sea!

3973
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,830
But now I'm back!

3974
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,120
Do you wanna know how my darling came back?

3975
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,960
Is he Luffy-sama{'s} 's friend too?

3976
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
No. He's an enemy, Shirahoshi!

3977
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,630
{Is old King Cobra "the Uptight" feeling well?}Old King "Straight-laced" Cobra is well, I hope.

3978
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:39,350
{Oh, wait. I just saw him looking ill,
so I'm just being tasteless!}Oh, pardon me. I noticed his failing health; 
how tasteless of me to have asked.

3979
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,640
Oh, {honey}darling!{"Honey" doesn't have the same oozing effect that evilly saying "darling" does.}

3980
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,770
You're the funniest man in the whole universe!

3981
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,240
Wapol!

3982
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,780
{Cut the crap!}Give it a rest!

3983
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,780
I can't believe you became a king again.

3984
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,450
King Dalton
Sakura Kingdom

3985
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,450
King Dalton
Sakura Kingdom

3986
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,450
I pity your new country.

3987
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,540
The World Government must be desperate!

3988
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,000
Dr. Kureha
Sakura Kingdom

3989
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,000
Dr. Kureha
Sakura Kingdom

3990
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,000
I can't believe they'd admit this idiot again!

3991
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,590
Dalton! The old witch hag!
You're still alive?!

3992
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,720
Hmm? {You're curious how I stay young?}Wanna know how I stay young?

3993
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,970
{I didn't ask that!}I wasn't asking!

3994
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,850
Dalton-san ! Dr. Kureha!
It's nice to see you again!

3995
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,770
Hello, Vivi-chan. You {are}look more dignified than ever.

3996
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,560
Are {you}ya happy?

3997
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,150
If I knew that you were
a princess back then,

3998
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,440
I would've charged you {a higher medical fee}more.

3999
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,820
Who are these people?

4000
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,580
I met them when I was traveling
with Luffy-san and the others.

4001
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:49,290
Nami became ill on our way to Arabasta,
so to find her a doctor,

4002
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,050
we {stopped by}made landfall at a winter island.

4003
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,180
{That's where}Back then, Luffy-san helped Dalton-san get rid of Wapol.{-san this and -san that.}

4004
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:06,560
{After that, the citizens chose to make him king and rename the country to the Sakura Kingdom.}Following that, the citizens chose him as their new king
and renamed the country the Sakura Kingdom.

4005
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,310
I see.

4006
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,320
Hey, hey, hey!

4007
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,910
{Dalton! You told me to cut the crap earlier,
even though you're merely my subordinate!}{Dalton-sama}{.}Dolt-on! Earlier, you told me to "give it a rest,"
which is strange to hear coming from a subordinate.

4008
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,740
That was long ago.

4009
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,370
Now...

4010
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,630
we are on equal footing!

4011
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,670
{Honey}Darling!

4012
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,340
Dalton-san !
You have mastered that kingly demeanor!

4013
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,680
What? No...

4014
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,510
Listen up, Dalton! You bastard in shining armor!

4015
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,730
{You can't be naive when running a country!}An honest throne won't help you run your country!

4016
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,520
I'm living proof, since I came back by making...

4017
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,860
a fortune with my Munch Munch Fruit power!

4018
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,900
The higher you climb,
{the more you'll see how dirty this world is!}the wider your view of the corruption around you!

4019
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,110
{I'll teach you! And pay you back...}Consider this both a lesson and payback for–

4020
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,660
By the way, did you read
that article about Luffy-kun?

4021
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,700
Yes, many times over.

4022
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,500
Say, maybe... Dalton-san...

4023
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,920
Do you like Lucy?

4024
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
You like Luffyland, don't you?

4025
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,090
{I really like him...}He's the best.{..}

4026
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,970
This is gonna be fun!

4027
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,180
{\an8}Impel Down, the undersea prison.

4028
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,440

00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,440
Impel Down{, the}

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,190

4031
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,280
{\an8}{Level 6, holds the criminals
who are considered extremely dangerous.}It's where the most dangerous 
of criminals are locked away.

4032
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,860
{\an8}Level 6{...},

4033
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,330
{\an8}Eternal Hell.

4034
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,290
What's with the solitary confinement?

4035
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,250
I'm all by my lonesome here.

4036
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,680
{Don't tell me you're trying
to protect me, Magellan!}Or are you saying this is for my protection, Magellan?!

4037
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,640
Have they come for me? An assassin from above?

4038
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,350
{In order to prevent me from spilling the secret of Mary Geoise,}They'll of course want to silence me
so I don't give away the secret of Mary Geoise.

4039
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,980
{they sent an assassin to silence me?!}Did they send an assassin to keep me quiet?!

4040
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,580
{Why does it matter if it's revealed?
Power is fleeting.}And why should it matter if I tell?
Power is fleeting...

4041
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,700
{Its corruption is never far!}with corruption close on its heels!

4042
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,670
Mary Geoise

4043
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,670
Mary Geoise
