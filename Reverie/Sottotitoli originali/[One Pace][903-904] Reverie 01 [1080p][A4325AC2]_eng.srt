1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,100
{\an8}The Great Pirate Era...

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,230
{\an8}has proven to be a more tumultuous storm 
than the World Government expected.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:18,120
{\an8}The figures in the eye of this relentless tempest are…

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,830
{\an8}Monkey D. Luffy...

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
{\an8}and the Straw Hat Pirates!

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,380
{\an8}To confront the furious Great Pirate Era...

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,430
{\an8}fifty world leaders have come together for the Reverie...

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,930
{\an8}a quadrennial conference that {is about to begin}will commence shortly.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,520
{\an8}Now is a time of great change.

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,660
{New World - At Sea}At Sea in the New World

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,660
{New World - At Sea}At Sea in the New World

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,660
The Fifth Emperor

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,660
The Fifth Emperor

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm hungry!

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,580
What's this?

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,250
Where did you get that?!

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,920
Huh? I just found it in my pocket.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,800
Cool! Is it real?

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,090
What is it?

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,140
{Don't you remember what Germa used to transform?!}Don't you remember?
It's what Germa used {for transformations}to transform!

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,970
{Oh! I remember!}Oh, that's right!

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,390
I'm gonna transform with it!

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,020
Wait! I'll go first!

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,310
Sanji!

25
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,690
I'm gonna get rid of it!

26
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,980
What?!

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,820
Don't throw it away!

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,990
If you do, I'll look for it on the ocean floor!

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,490
That's impossible! You can't swim!

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,540
{It was in my pocket.
If you don't want it just let me keep it!}I found it in my pocket{, so since }.
If you don't want it, let me have it instead!

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,950
No, let me have it! Please!

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,580
No way!

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,170
But I wonder how it ended up
in Luffy-san's pocket.

34
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,590
{It must’ve been Niji!
He did it to spite me.}Has to be Niji's work.
He did it as a dig against me.

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,140
{I don't want my strength
to come from their crappy technology!}If I'm to get stronger, my power
won't come through their brand of science!

36
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,060
Think about it, Sanji!

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,770
{Science is a kind of strength for humans!}{To humans, science }Science is{ power} a noble human power.

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,810
Why do you care so much?!

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,070
If we used the raid suit...

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,370
maybe we could shoot beams!

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,740
Are you guys children?!

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,910
{Franky can do that just fine!
 We don't need more freaks on our crew!}Leave that kind of stuff to Franky!
We've filled the gimmicky shipmate quota.

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,000
No! {I want it}It's mine!

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,170
{What? Are you making fun of science?}What? Were you making light of science?

45
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,130
Nami-swan !

46
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,260
There's no way I'd insult your science!

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,970
My Sorcery Clima-Tact is the fusion of...

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,350
{sky}atmospheric science and Usopp’s {technology}engineering!{Good idea, with some modification}{Gaijin, Viz translates this as atmospheric science and Usopp's craftsmanship.}

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,350
Look!

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,940
{It feels good to stay in that tact!}I just love bein' inside her tact!

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,070
Zeus?! {You're actually following her!}You actually tagged along?!

52
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,900
{I can't believe you chose your appetite over loyalty to Big Mom!}I can't believe food outweighs 
your loyalty to Big Mom!

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,280
I got myself a powerful servant!

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,910
N-Nami-san...

55
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,280
Zeus, remember this.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,500
I've been serving Nami-san
since{way} long before you came along!

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,090
But I{'m the one who lives} get to live in the tact
she {always has on her}keeps under her clothes!{I think this gets the idea across without such a clunky phrasing.}{Gaijin, Viz says "But I get to live in a [tact] that never leaves contact with Nami's body."}

58
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,880
Sanji-san, you're arguing with water vapor.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,550
All right! Let's go!

60
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,970
Why isn't it working?!

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,680
Stop whining!

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,560
I guess it only works on you!

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,270
{Show us!}Yeah! Show us!

64
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,270
Shut up! I'm not part of Germa!

65
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,070
Listen up! "Germa 66!" "Vinsmoke!"

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,650
Those are two names 
I never want to hear again!

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,320
Thank you!

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,620
Please transform!

69
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,620
L-Let go of me, you morons!

70
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,830
Hey, {guys}everybody! 
The newspaper's here!

71
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,040
Is there anything about us?

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,330
Let's see...

73
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,920
A close-up of Luffy!

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,920
What about Jinbe?
Does it {mention}say what happened after we left?!

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,260
{Um}Hmm. Jinbe, Jinbe… {It doesn't seem to mention anything after we left.}
There's not much mentioned after we got away.

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,270
It just says Luffy, Sanji, Jinbe, and Bege
attempted to assassinate Big Mom.

77
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,770
{It says Luffy was the mastermind!}And that Luffy was the mastermind!

78
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,810
Mastermind?!

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,730
Oh, {a wanted poster!}bounty posters!

80
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,360
{\an8}My bounty went up!
It's 330 million belly!

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,950
For real?!

82
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,200
{Hm? What}Wait, what was Moss {Head}Head's at?

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,370
I think Zoro-san's is...

84
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,540
320 million belly!

85
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,700
Yes!

86
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,790
{I beat you, shitty Moss Head!}Beat that, damn Moss Head!

87
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
It's just a number.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,050
They changed "only alive"
back to "dead or alive"!

89
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,140
Huh? What's wrong?

90
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,300
My name...

91
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,940
It says "Vinsmoke Sanji"!

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,520
{I see...}Makes sense.

93
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:03,240

{my bounty increased... because of Germa's reputation!}My bounty only increased because of Germa's infamy!

97
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,320
S-Sanji-san ! Are you okay?!

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,360
Huh! There's an even {more depressing}gloomier aura coming from there!

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,110
Jinbe {}finally joined Luffy-kun's crew!

537
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,530
{\an8}{I can't believe they picked a fight 
with Big Mom together.}It's unbelievable to think the two of them 
picked a fight with Big Mom.

538
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,530

540
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,410
{\an8}I wonder if they escaped on the same ship.

{\an8}{Of course. It says Big Mom was angry in the article.}Of course they did.
{It says in the article }The article says Big Mom was furious.

549
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:07,220
We{'ll have} need to officially declare that {this}our country
is now under the Straw Hats' protection{ now}-jamon !

550
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,890
Father{-sama}! Brothers{-sama}!

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,220

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,890
Princess Shirahoshi

554
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,890
I'll go to the Reverie with you!

555
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,730
{If I don't, Luffy-sama}I have to go, or Luffy-sama 
will call me Wimpyhoshi again!

556
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,320
I've been waiting for you to come around!

557
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,120
All right, let's go!

558
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,700
Okay!

559
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:44,710
{\an8}However, overshadowing the upcoming Reverie and stunning the public {is}was the news that rookie pirate...

560
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,300
{\an8}Straw Hat Luffy threatened Emperor Big Mom, 
whose position {hasn't}hadn't wavered in decades.

561
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,310
{\an8}The article {states}stated the following:

562
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,020
{\an8}"A {}reliable source has confirmed 
that Straw Hat Luffy...

563
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,190
{\an8}has already taken command of seven other powerful pirate crews.

564
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,440
{\an8}{Thus he is now in command of 5,000 subordinates.}{As a result, this}This move makes him
the commander of 5,000 subordinates.

565
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,410
{\an8}{Also noteworthy, Straw Hat considers Ace and Sabo, 
the Revolutionary Army's No. 2...}Of note, both Ace {and Sabo,
the Revolutionary Army's }{Number 2}
and the Revolutionary Army's number two, Sabo,

566
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,950
{\an8}{to be}are considered his sworn brothers.

567
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,540
{\an8}{His extraordinary charisma and leadership convinced the evil army Germa 66....}He convinced the evil army Germa 66,

568
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,330
{\an8}the Sun Pirates, and the Fire Tank Pirates
to follow him...

569
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,460
{\an8}without hesitation,
all due to his leadership and charisma.

570
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,340
{\an8}His guileful strategy resulted
in the destruction of the queen's castle.

571
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,010
{\an8}His might brought down two of her commanders, worth 800 million and {a}one billion respectively.

572
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,810
{\an8}Therefore, it is natural to consider {this a victory for }Straw Hat Luffy{} the victor!"

573
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,020
{\an8}And so, the article concludes with a proclamation:

574
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,940
{\an8}"The fifth emperor has emerged!"

575
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,490
What's {with}all this "fifth emperor" {crap}garbage?!

576
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,620

{While on route to the Reverie...}En route to the Reverie,

582
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,930
the ship from Lulucia
 was ambushed by pirates!

583
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,310
The king was unharmed,
but Princess Comane has been kidnapped.

584
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,930
{Where was the naval escort?!}What was the naval escort doing?!

585

Oh, okay.

That's our boss for you!

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,260
Everyone, once we reach the Holy Land,
you must not talk about this.

600
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,350
What? Why not?

601
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,720
We may be indebted to him,

602
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,390
but the World Government
and the Navy see him differently.

603
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,520
You're right! He's a pirate!

604
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,690
Exactly. And he's now gaining 
an extraordinarily dangerous reputation.

605
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,740
He's really something.
Oh yeah! I've got to show Viola-san !

606

Let's do that!

607
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,290
{It's no mistake... Those ships are from 
the Kingdoms of Dressrosa and Prodence!}No mistaking it. Those ships belong
to the Kingdoms of Dressrosa and Prodence!

608
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,250
{There's no naval escort either!}And no naval escort!

609
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,010
Oh! I-I see Princess Viola!

610
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,430
She's as gorgeous as they say.

611
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,840
{Is the girl with her also
a royal family member?}Is that other girl a member 
of the royal family?

612
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,850
{If we kidnap them too,
 I think they'll pay any ransom!}We'll get to name our price
if we kidnap the both of 'em too.

613
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,100
Right, Princess Comane?

614
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,400
{Contact}Just call Papa already!
He'll pay you as much as you want!

615
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,320
This is why I like royal families!

616
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,120
{You're gonna have to wait a little .
{We're greedy}Just hold out a bit longer.
We're pretty damn greedy.

617

{But they}Anyway, they won't see us coming...

618
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,620
since we're hidden underwater!

619
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,870
Sink 'em!

It's impossible to guard against a torpedo!

622
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,240
What{ happened}?!

623
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,280
An ambush?!

624
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,450
Ready the cannons!

625
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,370
Yes, sir!

Don't! There's no need!

You're safe now!

That's impossible!

635
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,350
We're gonna sink!

636

How did you get here?

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,000
I had to go on ahead of my ship.

{Pirates were just targeting this ship from underwater.}Just now, pirates were targeting you from underwater.

What? From the Rocky Port Incident?

660
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,190
{That incident was masterminded by }Trafalgar Law, one of the Worst Generation,
played a pivotal role in that incident.{It sounds like he's just stating a fact, but how's this work for you?}{Gaijin, is there a softer way for the king to say this? It's a bit strange to see him hating on Law hardcore like this after he and Luffy returned the kingdom to him.}

661
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,610
You're the hero who protected the citizens.

662

686

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,800
Th-That's because...

695
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,850
Come on. Let's talk!

696
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,850

697
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,680
Oh, Luffyland is in this article here too!

So you do like him!

700
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,990
Damn.

701
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Having my bounty increase
because of Germa's reputation...

702
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,200
is so depressing.

703
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,710
Hey, are you all right?

704
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,420
Do your wounds hurt?

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,920
N-No.

My bounty went down!

708
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,060
Look... it's 150 million belly!

709
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,020
What?!

710
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,860
Really?! I thought it just increased to 500 million recently!

711
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,980
{150}One hundred fifty million is
lower than your bounty two years ago!

712
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,860
{Is that possible}How is that even possible?! 
Did you do something wrong?!

713
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,450
{Wouldn't it have gotten bigger?}Wouldn't that make it bigger?

714
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,700
Oh, that's right.

715
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,910
It's not so bad. 
Fewer people will come after us.

716
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:46,170
Nami-san ! Luffy is our captain!
This could harm our {reputation}whole image!

717
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,340

To hell with the Navy!

729
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,130
Their king's gone to the Reverie.
All their {able}best soldiers {are accompanying}went away with him!

730
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,060
{A defenseless country is the perfect prey for pirates!}A defenseless country is jus' 
beggin' pirates to raid it!

731
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,890
