1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,060
{\an8}The Great Pirate Era...

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,190
{\an8}has proven to be a more tumultuous storm than the World Government expected.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,120
{\an8}The figures in the eye of this relentless tempest are...

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,830
{\an8}Monkey D. Luffy...

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,120
{\an8}and the Straw Hat Pirates!

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,380
{\an8}To confront the furious Great Pirate Era...

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,840
{\an8}fifty world leaders have come
together for the Reverie...

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,930
{\an8}a quadrennial conference that {is about to begin}will commence shortly.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,610
{\an8}Now is a time of great change.

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,290
The Empty Throne

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,290
The Empty Throne

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,210
Kaido-sama !

13
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,720
What is it?!
Don't bother me when I'm drinking!

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,180
No! I didn't mean to!

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,310
The thing is...

16
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,940
Whole Cake Island

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,940
Whole Cake Island

18
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,110
What do you want?!

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,320
It's about Straw Hat.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,540
He's on his way to you.

21
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,910
{So what?}What are you getting at?

22
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,210
Listen, keep your hands off him!

23
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,630
I'm coming to Wano to claim Straw Hat's head myself.

24
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,340
Is this some kind of {a }joke?! I refuse!

25
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,090
I have no business with you.

26
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,390
{I've got to take Straw Hat out, or I'll lose face!}If I don't personally squash Straw Hat, 
{my reputation will suffer}I'll become a laughingstock.{Zenef: I like the original line "I'll lose face" but it's much shorter than the spoken line.}

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,230
Besides, he has something that I want back!

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,940
I don't care!

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,900
You still owe me big time, {right}don't you?

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,530
Owe you?

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,160
{You remember, don't you?}Don't tell me you've forgotten.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,370
That was a long time ago!

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,240
{But...}{No matter!}Even so, it was a {lifetime}lifelong debt.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,050
{I'm the one who's got a grudge against that Straw Hat brat!}I'm the one who'll get even 
with that Straw Hat rookie!

35
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,720
So I'm the one who'll kill him!

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,430
{If you come, I'll kill you too, Linlin!}Show your face, and I'll kill you too, Linlin!

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,220
I'd like to see you try.{I didn't call to get your permission, I'm just giving you fair warning.}

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,730
I'm not asking your permission;
this is merely a courtesy call.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,690
{Get it}Got that? Straw Hat's head is mine!

40
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,990
{Let's try and get along... like we used to!}So let's play nice... for old times' sake!

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,410
{Navy Headquarters, }New Marineford

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,410
{Navy Headquarters, }New Marineford

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,530
Big Mom is on the move!

44
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,410
It {appears that}seems she's contacted Kaido!

45
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,750
They're using an unsecured channel!

46
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,840
{They don't care about being wiretapped}Don't they care if we overhear?!
Are they trying to provoke us?

47
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,920
{Let's try and get along...}So let's play nice...

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,390
{What could oppose both 
Emperor Big Mom and Emperor Kaido?}What force could possibly oppose 
Emperor Big Mom and Emperor Kaido?

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,260
{The admirals}Admirals? The Seven Warlords?

50
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,730
{Do you want me to head out, Sakazuki?}Should I head out, Sakazuki?

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,480
Wait, Borsalino.

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,320
{We don't know the military capability of Wano.}We have zero intel on {the military might of Wano}Wano's military capacity.

53
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,200
{The samurai, huh?}Their samurai, you mean?

54
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,200
Seriously?! Garp-chan ?!

55
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,200
The Red Port

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,200
The Red Port

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,750
{Aren't Kaido and Big Mom going after your grandson?!}Don't Kaido and Big Mom each have 
a bone to pick with your grandson?!

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,380
{Straw Hat Luffy!}With Straw Hat Luffy?!

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,670
{That's hilarious!}What a riot!

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,180
{This isn't a joke!}You realize this isn't a joke, right?

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,140
{Are you just going to allow two of the emperors to team up?}You're saying you'd just let two emperors team up?

62
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,140
Vice Admiral Gion "Momousagi"
Navy Headquarters

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,140
Vice Admiral Gion "Momousagi"
Navy Headquarters

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,390
{Well, it's not like we can do anything anyway;
it's the Reverie!}It's not as if we can do anything right now. 
Not during the Reverie anyway.

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Most of our manpower has been 
assigned to protect {the royals}royalty!

66
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,190
But if nothing is done...

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,820
Pardon me, ma'am,

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,070
but this is Big Mom we're {talking}talkin' about.

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,410
{She must have known that the Navy couldn't spare any marines...}She must've known the Navy ain't gonna spare a soul,

70
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,030
Vice Admiral Tokikake "Chaton"
Navy Headquarters

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,030
Vice Admiral Tokikake "Chaton"
Navy Headquarters

72
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,030
{because of the Reverie!}what with the Reverie!

73
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,990
You're right, but...

74
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,540
What did Mister Sakazuki say?

75
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,960
He said, "Wano is a not a member country,
so it's outside our jurisdiction."

76
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,630
{Just as I'd expect!}Figured as much!

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,550
Best not to get involved for now!

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,300
But Garp-kun,

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,100
if Big Mom and Kaido are up to something again,

80
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,390
Rear Admiral Hina
{Rear Admiral, }Navy Headquarters

81
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,390
Rear Admiral Hina
{Rear Admiral, }Navy Headquarters

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,390
we shouldn't take it lightly.

83
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,390
After all,

84
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,310
{you became known as the hero of the Navy because of them...}they're the reason you're 
known as the "{h}Hero of the Navy."

85
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,280
{The "Rocks", huh?}Rocks, huh?

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,030
{Hina, you're quite young.
Where did you hear about this?}Hina, I'd've guessed you'd be 
too young to hear about that.

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,250
{Before Roger, it was definitely their era!}Before Roger, that era belonged to them !

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,420
But that was 40 years ago.
The past is in the past.

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,380
{Even though}Though they lost their captain,
{they're still gaining influence.}their influence only grows.

90
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,090
Hina's worried.

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,180
No point worrying!

92
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,970
{True, they would be a threat if they returned,
but things never turn out how you'd expect anyway...}True, they'd be a threat if they returned,
but the future always finds ways to surprise us!

93
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,400
{Your grandson's bounty is also a real problem.}But seriously, that bounty on your grandson's
a real nuisance, ain't it?

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,150
{I mean, it jumped to 1.5 billion belly.}It recently jumped to 1.5 billion belly, didn't it?

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
Why are you smiling? Hina's confused.

96
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
{He's still just a fledgling.}And he's still just getting started...

97
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,540
Pangaea Castle

98
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,540
Pangaea Castle

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,540
You may enter, King Sterry of Goa.

100
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,860
So this is the center of the world!

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,620
– Now, swear your oath.{..}
– What?

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,880
C-Can I sit there?!

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,210
Don't joke about such things!{Is that supposed to be a joke?!}

104
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,170
Tch!

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,340
No one is allowed to sit upon that throne.

106
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,590
It is the Empty Throne.

107
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,430
It symbolizes equality between the {rulers of nations.}nations' leaders.

108
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,970
The oath affirms that no ruler
will seek dominion over the rest.

109
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,390
The 20 weapons {that protect the throne...}that stand sentinel over the throne...

110
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,570
were placed there 800 years ago to represent 
the oaths of the First Twenty, {who created the world.}the world's creators.

111
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,110
It is located at the very center of the world.

112
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,660
Its vacancy is evidence of peace.

113
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:23,210
{The greatest authority in the world remains with the Five Elders, the highest-ranking Celestial Dragons.}{While}As the Five Elders, the {highest-ranking}Celestial Dragons' leadership, remain the greatest authority in the world,{Not the greatest sentence structure here...}

114
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,710
{There is no one ruler of the world.}their division of {leadership}power symbolizes how there is no one ruler over all.

115
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,850
Now, swear your oath, King Sterry.

116
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,810
If I sit there, I'll be king of the world!

117
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,560
King Sterry?

118
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,320
I wanna sit there!

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,490
What are you...?!

123
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,950
Please stop!

124
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,960
I caught one-{eh}ee !

Saint Charlos

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,830
I caught a giant mermaid-{eh}ee !

128
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,710
Shirahoshi!

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,220
Father{-}{sama}...

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,640
{How can we forgive such an outrage}Do you expect us to overlook 
such disrespect, Father{-}{sama}?!

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,060
Come on! Calm down!

132
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,520
What are you doing?! Please stop!

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,900
That's right! Chain her up!

134
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,190
Shirahoshi!

135
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,360
{Wait}Hold it! What are you doing,
Princess of Arabasta?!{Open to ideas, but what he's saying is fairly straightforward}{Gaijin, this sounds a bit stiff. Can we take any liberties with this one?}

136
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,780
Shirahoshi-chan !

137
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,120
Stop, Rebecca! He's a Celestial Dragon!

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,330
So what?! Let go of me!

139
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,330
{They have no perspective}They lack common sense!
If you anger them, they'll destroy Dressrosa!

140
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,890
That bastard{...}!

141
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,220
Don't do it, Leo!

142
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,180
Shirahoshi{...}!

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,650
Whoa, come on!

144
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,740
No one interfere!{Hard to say, but the manga seems to have him thinking it. His mouth doesn't look like it's speaking.}{Do you think he's actually saying this, or do we leave this in the Thoughts style?}

145
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,240
Come on!

146
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,290
{Do it}Capture it, Slave #3!

147
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll make it my pet-{eh}ee !

148
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,470
{I can't just stand here!
How dare he do that to our boss' friend!}No standin' around!
He's gonna pay for doin' this to our boss' friend!

149
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,600
Leo!

150
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,480
Damn! {I have no choice!}There's no other way!

151
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,230
I'm coming for you, Mermaid Princess!

152
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,400
– Don't do it, Kanese soldier!
– Somebody, stop him!

153
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,610
Let me go!

But I am indebted to the Ryugu Kingdom

F-Father{-}{sama} !

323
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,680
Oh, look at you!

324
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,220
My dearest son!

325
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,690
Huh?

326
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,560
Where did the queen dowager go?

327
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,400
Damn that Mjosgard! I'll make him pay for this!

328
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,610
He's always been a strange man:

329
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,780
a Celestial Dragon who doesn't own a single slave!

330
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,080
Just like Homing who descended
to the lower realm 30 years ago!

331
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,750
The Donquixote family {must be crazy}is full of lunatics-{eh}ee !

332
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,090
Father{-}{sama}, that's...

333
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,140
Warlord Bartholomew Kuma
(Former Revolutionary Officer and Former King of Sorbet)

334
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,140
Warlord Bartholomew Kuma
(Former Revolutionary Officer and Former King of Sorbet)

335
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,140
the invincible slave, Kuma!

336
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,850
That's right!

337
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,560
{My turn to rent him finally came}I finally got to rent him out-{eh}ee !

338
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,900
{\an8}Bartholomew Kuma, known as “the Tyrant,”

339
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,280
{\an8}was once a universally feared pirate.

340
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,900
{\an8}Few have had as checkered a life as his.

341
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,240
{\an8}Kuma, one of the Seven Warlords,

342
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,200
{\an8}{received a special assignment from the World Government...}took on a special mission from the World Government
to eliminate the Straw Hats.

343
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,630
{\an8}{Thus he suddenly emerged
in front of Luffy and the others...}He reached Thriller Bark just as Luffy
and the others pulled through their arduous battle. {right after their hard-fought battle on Thriller Bark.}

344
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,810
{36}Thirty-Six-Pound Phoenix!

345
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,110
{Is that your ability?}So that's your ability?{Pepperjack, more flashbacks for you!}

346
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,070
I have the power to repel things.

347
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,740
I ate the Paw Paw Fruit 
and became a {paw paw}paw pad man.

348
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,330
Are you truly willing to die for that man?

349
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,790
Right now, it's the only way
to save my crewmates!

350
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,840
My {ambition}dream means nothing
if I can't protect my own captain.

351
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,720
{Luffy is gonna be king of the pirates!}Luffy will be king of the pirates!

352
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,560
He has good friends.

353
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,820
I should have expected no less
from your son, Dragon.

354
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,660
{\an8}{Even though Kuma is a warlord,
he disobeyed the government's orders...}Despite Kuma's status as a warlord,
he disobeyed the government's orders,

355
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,660
{\an8}and for some unknown reason,
{spared the Straw Hats' lives.}he spared the Straw Hats' lives.

356
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,550
This is so exciting-{eh}ee !
Father{-}{sama} finally got to rent the invincible slave Kuma!

357
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,510
It's {convenient}advantageous to have
a warlord as a slave-{eh}ee !

358
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,390
You can hit him!

359
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,050
You could even stab him!

360
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,140
Yet he doesn't ever scream.
He's a top-class slave-{eh}ee !

361
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,360
Nice, Father{-}{sama} ! I want one too-{eh}ee !

362
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,990
Ow, ow, ow{...}! I'm gonna die-{eh}ee.{..}

363
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,950
{You must remain calm}Please stay still, Charlos-sama !

364
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,450
Ow, ow, ow{...}! {I really got a thrashing}He did a number on me-{eh}ee !

365
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,960
Oh, poor Charlos!

366
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Let's get the world's greatest doctor
to look at you-{eh}ee !

367
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,130
I didn't expect {to}I'd see him {this}so soon!

368
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,020
{Captain of the Bonney PiratesJewelry Bonney, a Pirate of the Worst Generation}Captain Jewelry Bonney

370
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,020
My infiltration was a success.

371
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,820
I'll never forgive them!

372
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,820
{Ever!}Not ever!

373
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,290
Damn!

374
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,170
{Don't get mad, Sabo...}Don't get in a tizzy, Sabo!

375
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,250
Beneath the Land of the Gods{ - }, Home of the Celestial Dragons

376
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,250
Beneath the Land of the Gods{ - }, Home of the Celestial Dragons

377
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,250
You boys {are so scary}can all be so scary!

378
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,630
{It's impossible not to get mad!}I can't help but get mad!

379
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,220
Our {friend}comrade is going through hell!

380
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,600
Our gentle Kuma!

381
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,850
{It's unforgivable...}It's unthinkable{...}!

382
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,940
Calm down.

383
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,570
We get it. We all feel the same way.

384
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,150
We won't leave Kuma-san to this fate!

385
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,320
{That's one of the reasons we came here...}After all, he's one of the reasons we came here.

386
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,580
Having said that, even if we set him free,
he'll never return to his old self.

387
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,500
{Still}Let's not forget, Kuma-chan is a prime example
of the World Government's oppression!

388
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,170
Since Kuma-san {was formerly a king}is the former king
of a member nation,

389
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,840
they wanted to make 
an example out of him as a warning.

390
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,060
{To show that no matter how tough you are}A warning that no matter your strength or resolve,
this is how you end up if you disobey the gods!

391
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,150
The Celestial Dragons have CP-0
and Navy Headquarters {on their side.}in their corner.

392
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,520
If we fail and get caught{...}–

393
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,360
No. Failure is not an option.

394
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,820
We either succeed...

395
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,280
or we die!

396
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,250

{\an8}It's finally time for the Reverie!

399
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,670
Pangaea Castle

400
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,670
Pangaea Castle

401
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,670
{\an8}The world is divided into four oceans...

00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:06,640
EAST BLUE

403
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:06,640

409
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:06,640
WEST BLUE

NEW WORLD

411

413
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:06,640
MARY GEOISE

414
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,090
{\an8}by {a}the continental wall{ - the Red Line...}, the Red Line...

415
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,930
{\an8}and the deadly seas of the Grand Line and the New World,

416
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,640
{\an8}{where Luffy and his crew are adventuring.}which is where Luffy and his crew are adventuring.

417
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,100
{\an8}The World Government is a truly massive organization.

418
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,020
{\an8}Most countries in the world are members: 
{A total of 170 nations}170 nations total!

419
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:24,160
{\an8}Of those, 50 monarchs are chosen as representatives to assemble in the Holy Land every four years.

420
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,880
W-Where's my seat?!

421
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,090
– Finally.
– Yeah.

422
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,520
How's your country been?
You said it was ravaged by pirates four years ago?

423
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,980
Thanks to Fleet Admiral Sakazuki,
they were sent to Impel Down.

424
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,280
Speaking of pirates, there is one name I'm hearing often lately. I think it's...

425
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,400
Straw Hat Luffy, right?

426
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:08,200
He attempted to assassinate Big Mom,
and rumor has it that he's going after Kaido next.

427
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Kaido?! {Does that mean Wano
will be in turmoil next?}Does that mean 
Wano is next in line for disaster?

428
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,590
Wano is not affiliated with the World Government,
{so it's already practically lawless.}which effectively makes it a lawless land.

429
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,590
{We don't know if it even operates as a country.}We don't even know if it operates as a country.

430
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,010
Is there nothing we can do?!

431
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,640
Sending the Navy would cost money.

432
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,440
Trouble seems to follow this 
Straw Hat Luffy, wherever he goes.

433
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,070
You got that right!{!}

434
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,320
What's so funny, Prodence?

435
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Luffy-kun...

436
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,250
The position of chairman always rotates.

437
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,870
Who is it this time?

438
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,380
{It's me!}I am!

439
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,630
{It's a pleasure, everyone.}Everyone, it will be my honor.

440
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,340
Ballywood, huh?

441
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,050
Sounds good.

442
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,430
{I think you'll run things efficiently.}This should run smoothly, then.

443
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,220
Even if we have a full seven days,
we have so much to address.

444
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,770
{\an8}This is the great conference 
that determines the order of the world.

445
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,850
{\an8}It is known as...

446
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,860
Well then... my fellow monarchs...

447
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,280
let us carefully discuss 
the future of this beautiful world!

448
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,960
{\an8}the Reverie!

449
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,840
{It seems like the conference has begun...}And so the conference begins.{..}

450
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,720
Apparently, King Cobra of Arabasta
is requesting an audience with us.

451
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,890
The Nefertari family...

452
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,640
was the only family of the First Twenty,
who stayed in the lower realm 800 years ago.

453
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,480
In a sense, they're traitors.
Has he noticed something?

454
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,530
Let's hope he doesn't make things complicated.

455
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,660
You {can}could say the same
about the {Big Mom and Kaido situation}situation with Big Mom and Kaido.

456
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,540
It's been two years since the Summit War.
 {Yet}And yet{...}, this maelstrom will not cease.

457
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,880
{The balance of the world can not be maintained forever.}This world's equilibrium 
cannot be maintained indefinitely.

458
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,670
{It seems like a great cleansing is in order.}The time has come for a great cleansing.

459
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,560
{Pangaea Castle - }The Chamber of Flowers
Pangaea Castle

460
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,560
{Pangaea Castle - }The Chamber of Flowers
Pangaea Castle

461
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
Imu-sama.

462
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,980
{They have arrived.}The {Elder Stars}Five Elders have arrived.

463
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,580
Have you discovered another light 
to be erased from history?

464
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,250
{Has the decision been made?}Is it decided, then?

465
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,180
If so, you need only give us the name!
