We're fallen angels,

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
we'll fire arrows into your dreams.

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
What color shall we add

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,390

00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes.

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,780
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth.

23

Surreal fallen angels,

{\an5}The Circling Bounties and
The Duel on Banaro Island!

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,640
Speaking of the judiciary island Enies Lobby,

27
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,640
After causing a disturbance on the entranceway of the World Government,

28
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,600
Both the marines and pirates won't be able to remain silent.

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,150
Right now, the strawhat pirates' name is resounding in the whole world.

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,130
Along with this poster.

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,250
Sanji is the best!

Isn't it amazing, customers?!

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
It's just like the real thing!

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,070
This is the home of the 77 million belly bounty Black Leg Sanji!

37
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,240
Welcome to the Floating Restaurant Baratie!

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Today we party!

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
For the most expensive guy in the east!

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,020
300 million bounty!

44
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,380
A toast for our Luffy!

45
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,730
Be silent!

46
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,610
Show some manners! Manners!

47
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,200
Cheers!

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
Hey!

49
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,350
Geez...

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,940
No one listens to what the mayor says.

51
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,590
Seems like he's having fun.

52
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,340
He's even got this cute pet.

53
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,280
These must be Luffy's friends.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,230
You call these criminals friends?!

55
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,130
An enemy to the whole world came from our village!

56
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,680
I've never heard of a pirate declaring war on the World Government!

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,500
That's true...

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,700
What does that Garp think he's doing?!

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,650
Letting his own grandson cause such a terrible incident.

60
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,870
What's wrong with those three guys...

61
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,720
I wonder if Dadan knows about this...

62
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,580
Cheers!

63
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,180
I told you to be quiet!

Sogeking, the King of the Snipers...

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,940
You're right!

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,130
There's no doubt about it!

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,370
This is Usopp-san!

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,000
Right?!

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,110
This nose is the Captain's, right?!

72
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,200
The villagers don't believe us!

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,020
He's worth 30 million!

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,250
But we knew Kaya-san would recognize him!

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,830
Nobody knows the awesomeness of the Captain!

76
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,450
Captain is a man who turns all lies into truth!

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,740
This mask is so cool!

78
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,160
Let's make some clay replicas!

79
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,970
Where are you going Kaya-san?

80
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,210
I'm gonna continue my medical studies.

81
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,330
I have to become one fine doctor!

82
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,560
So even if Usopp-san comes back injured, I can cure all of his wounds!

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,740
I'm jealous of the Captain...

84
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,100
We'll kick his ass if he makes Kaya-san sad.

Shimotsuki Village       Zoro's Hometown

87
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,950
{\an8}Sensei! Sensei!

88
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,860
{\an8}Is it true that the Pirate Hunter Zoro once studied at this dojo?!

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, it's true.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,840
But I forbid you to look up to him!

91
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,880
Why?! He's so cool!

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,270
Please show us how to be pirates too!

93
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,250
I didn't teach him how to become a pirate.

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,430
Really?!

95
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,090
Don't lie, sensei!

96
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,010
My, my, what a terrible elder they have chosen.

97
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,010
I also wanna become such an amazing swordsman!

98
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,990
I was surprised about the events on Judiciary Island, but...

99
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,840
Me too!

100
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,490
Zoro-kun, it seems you have no regrets.

101
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,280
No matter what kind of person you become,

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,560
It's fine a long as you treasure your way of the sword.

Here are the oranges.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,990
What, you brought them again, Nojiko?!

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,640
Even though I told you I'll buy them in the store.

109
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,700
Well, just accept them, don't be so modest.

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,710
You know that you're like a father to Nami and I.

111
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,970
If you say so.

112
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,020
What're you doing?

113
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,610
Well...

114
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,410
I'm trying to use the Den Den Mushi to call the Marine headquarters to complain

115
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,100
But I'm not getting a single response!

116
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,480
Complain?

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,270
That's right!

118
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,260
Do they really think they can distribute this improper poster to the entire world?!

119
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,020
Instead of bounty hunters, lovestruck suitors will gather to go after her! Unacceptable!

120
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,360
But you liked that picture, right?

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Since you enlarged it.

122
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,270
Well, it's fine, besides...

123
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,070
They're keeping the promise they made to you...

124
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,990
If by any chance you take away Nami's smile,

125
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,980
I'll personally go and kill you!

126
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,060
That's the evidence.

127
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
Well, that's true but...

128
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,200
That's the pirates problem!

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,100
Then, would you prefer an ugly photo?

130
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,710
No! That's unacceptable!

131
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,670
The Grand Line

Doctor Kureha.

134
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,810
Dolton, why did you call me?

135
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,780
I'm a very busy person!

136
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,580
I'm very sorry.

137
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,380
I just had to show you this.

138
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,830
What do you want? The secret to my youth?

139
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,730
Anyway Dolton, why don't you go live in the castle as king?

140
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,000
I can lend you a room.

141
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,680
No, thank you, I'm already used to living in this village.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Besides, I like eating chestnuts.

143
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,470
It's the Straw Hat kid and the others...

144
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,720
Wanted posters came out after the recent incident.

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,890
Chopper.

146
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,270
I think they made a mistake about the amount.

147
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,390
It's fine since I got to see his face.

148
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,050
That's right...

149
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,590
This is the best news I've gotten in a while.

150
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,330
The Grand Line

151
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,330
White soil Island Baltigo.

152
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,330
{\an8}The rebel army has succeded at the South Blue St. Urea!

153
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,710
One more kingdom has fallen...

154
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,140
They did it!

155
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,730
With this, the other day news about North Blue...

156
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,530
Don't be glad about a victory!

157
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,650
This is war.

158
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,890
I-I'm sorry...

159
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,820
And this is?

160
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,470
It's Straw Hat Luffy.

161
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,700
The one who took down Crocodile at Arabasta.

162
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,020
After the events at Enies Lobby, the government couldn't keep hiding his big group of pirates.

163
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,980
The crew's total bounty is 667 million and 50 belly.

164
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,820
Their Captain is the marine Garp's...

165
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,560
Where are you going?

166
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,830
To get some fresh air.

167
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,950
Live according to your thoughts, Luffy.

168
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,600
There are times when the era suddenly determines everything...

169
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,290
The World's Most Wanted Man

170
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,290
The Revolutionary

171
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,290
Dragon

172
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,290
Monkey D. Dragon

173
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,110
Question the world!

174
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,720
The day we meet will come.

175
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,900
Oh! Ace!

176
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,620
We go back three days before the bounties of the Strawhat crew surprised the whole world.

177
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,100
An event occurred on a certain island...

178
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,580
This is the Grand Line, Banaro Island.

179
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,880
Commander.

180
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,210
Knock it off! Commander is a word only those respectful of that person are allowed to say.

181
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,750
Stop mocking.

182
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,880
So you're the famous Fire Fist Ace...

183
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,730
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,810
Nice to meet you.

185
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,730
It seems now you've become quite a Captain, right?

186
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,890
Captain of the Blackbeard pirates, Marshall D. Teach.

187
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,770
What's wrong, Ace?!

188
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,390
It's been a long time!

189
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,410
How did you know I was here?

190
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,300
Teach, stop asking useless questions.

191
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,770
You took a man's life.

192
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,080
You must have a comprehension of the current situation.

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
Isn't that right?

194
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,500
Yeah, I know.

195
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,100
Then, let me say just one thing.

196
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,880
Ace, will you join my crew?!

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,370
Rule the world with me!

198
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,090
I've already planned every single thing.

199
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,120
Whitebeard's time is over already.

200
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,060
It is I who'll become the Pirate King!

201
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,490
First, I'll go to Water Seven from here to kill Straw Hat Luffy and hand him over to the government.

202
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,730
Luffy...?!

203
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,650
What did you say...?

204
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,060
Oh, You know him?

205
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,660
I won't let you lay a finger on him.

206
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,240
He's my little brother!

207
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,500
And, of course I'm not gonna join....

208
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,000
...your crew.

209
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,300
Seems like we have a guy without manners here.

210
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,410
Fire Gun!

211
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,140
Flame Commandment...

212
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Fire Pillar!

213
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,190
Auger, Burgess.

214
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,280
You stay out of this!

215
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,500
You're still no match for that man!

216
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,580
Step back!

217
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,280
Sorry.

218
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,400
Fire Fist!

219
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,700
Captain!

220
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,460
Captain!

221
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,160
Captain.

222
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,620
Lay it off, you guys!

223
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,740
Stay back!

224
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,930
I understand, Ace.

225
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,150
You want to kill me, right?

226
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,940
That's right, the murder of a crewmate is a big crime.

227
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,320
It's true I killed the 4th Division Commander Thatch!

228
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
I had no choice!

229
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,750
He had the devil fruit I wanted.

230
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,540
The ship's rule was that the guy who finds it gets to eat it.

231
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,130
I memorized all devil fruit shapes from a book, so...

232
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,130
I immediately knew that was the one I was looking for.

233
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:30,100
I stayed all those decades on Whitebeard’s ship thinking it would raise the chance to run into that fruit.

234
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,100
If I had run out of luck, I'd have given up on it, but...

235
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,440
That fruit came into my friend's possession!

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,150
And after killing Thatch... you stole it.

237
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,150
Well, it was just the spur of the moment.

238
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,430
This ability has chosen me, Ace!

239
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,170
With this, I have become the strongest man, Ace!

240
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,930
Look!

241
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,700
It's unique even among logia!

242
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,410
Ace, your body is fire, right?

243
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,940
I am...

244
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,110
Darkness!

245
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,430
Look! It's that black smoke from before!

246
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,700
Those pirates are still in town!

247
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,390
They're still up to something!

248
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,610
At this rate, the town will be destroyed!

249
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,860
Don't get near them!

250
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,510
Just run!

251
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,920
Darkness?

252
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,370
That's right, Commander Ace.

253
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,250
I can't get killed by you!

254
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,590
Out of all the devil fruits recorded in history, the one with this power is known as the most evil of them all!

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
A logia, the Darkness Fruit.

256
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,050
I've become a man of darkness!

257
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,320
I'll give you a taste of its power right now!

258
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,980
Do as you like.

259
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
What're you doing?! Hurry up!

260
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,850
The Captain is rampaging!

261
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,030
Hurry up and take cover!

262
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,130
Even we might get involved!

263
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,560
Stand up!

264
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,440
Something is crawling on the ground.

265
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
It's that thing that comes out of his body.

266
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
So scary!

267
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,030
It's like a black hole on the ground!

268
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,860
Looks like we could get sucked in!

269
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
Hurry up and escape!

270
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,710
Find shelter!

271
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,240
Take refuge in the forest!

272
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,880
Run to the coast!

273
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,870
Darkness is gravity.

274
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,550
The power to drag in everything...

275
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,640
and to keep all light from escaping,

276
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,210
infinite gravity.

277
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,140
Even so, it doesn't seem to be reaching me.

278
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,270
I'm not going after you yet...

279
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,790
Just stand there and take a look at the town.

280
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,100
Black Hole!

281
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,430
The town is... being swallowed into the ground!

282
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,560
Why?!

283
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,440
W-What's going on?!

284
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,690
The gravity of darkness condenses every object with its infinite power.

285
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,980
Crushing them!

286
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,250
Am I dreaming?

287
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,250
Our town has...

288
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,050
Has it vanished?

289
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,600
Right now I'll show you...

290
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,400
What became of it!

291
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Liberation!

292
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,720
The town has...

293
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,260
Turned into just a pile of wood.

294
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,240
You get it now, Ace?!

295
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,040
This is the power I've gained!

296
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,380
Firefly...

297
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,950
Fiery Doll!

298
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,810
Hot!

299
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
I understand pretty well the greatness of the power of darkness.

300
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,200
But, this is quite strange...

301
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,350
If you're a logia, you should be able to dodge an attack such as this.

302
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,140
I already told you...

303
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,410
Darkness drags in everything.

304
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,090
Bullets, blades, strikes, fire and even lightning.

305
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,550
I can't dodge attacks like the rest of you do.

306
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,920
My body absorbs much more pain than a normal human.

307
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,970
But, in exchange for that risk there's one more thing I'm capable of absorbing!

308
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,210
Dark Vortex!

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
The gravity of darkness can accurately absorb the "entity" of a devil fruit user!

310
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,580
Gravity?!

311
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,090
And thus, my body can...!

312
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,100
How is it?

313
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,420
Have you figured it out yet, Ace?

314
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,880
No way...!

315
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,840
It's been a while since someone actually hit you, right?

316
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,010
Ace.

317
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,010
You understood the moment I grabbed you.

318
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,090
The other thing my darkness can absorb is...

319
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,760
Devil fruit powers!

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,940
In other words, by being touched, those with devil fruit abilities are unable to use their ability!

321
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,170
Logia, Zoan, Paramecia....

322
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,690
All those overconfident devil fruit users in the world...

323
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,610
I've obtained the ability to expose their weakness!

324
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,700
So it's fine if I don't get caught.

325
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,330
I just proved to you that you can't get away from the gravity of darkness!

326
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,490
Dark Vortex!

327
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,380
St. Elmo's Fire!

328
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,800
Ace...!

329
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,280
Damn!

330
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,370
A flame lance?!

331
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,460
He almost broke my neck!

332
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,260
Quite a troublesome ability he has.

333
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,180
Cross Fire!

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,460
Another banana rock is being destroyed...

335
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,010
What's going on?

336
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,050
This isn't humane.

337
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,680
Not only this town...

338
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,150
The whole island will get...!

339
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,210
I always thought that devil fruit users relied too much on their abilities,

340
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,150
and if they happened to lose them, they would become rather fragile, but...

341
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,820
As expected of a Commander on Whitebeard's ship...

342
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,250
His basic combat abilities are also quite fearsome.

343
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,750
Well then, today once again...

344
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,670
Fate has separated our ways.

345
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,610
Everything is useless before darkness.

346
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,010
Even that strength of yours.

347
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,220
However, it would be a shame to waste that power.

348
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,160
Ace! Join my crew!

349
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,010
If I surrender my power to you, then there was no point in me being a man.

350
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,620
I definitely won't live with regrets.

351
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,380
Got that, idiot?

352
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,390
How long can you keep living like that in this world...

353
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,790
It's a shame, Ace.

354
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,750
Die by the darkness!

355
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,370
Great Flame Commandment...!!

356
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,310
Flame Emperor!!!

357
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,800
The sun or the darkness.

358
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,280
There can only be one winner!

359
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,850
I'll make Whitebeard...

360
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,290
The King.

361
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,310
The Grand Line Banaro Island duel...

362
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
The fight between those two pirates,

363
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,600
Will be remembered as the trigger for a big event that has yet to come.
