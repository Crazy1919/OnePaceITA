We're fallen angels,

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,310
we'll fire arrows into your dreams.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
What color shall we add

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,390

Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes.

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,740
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth.

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,700
Surreal fallen angels,

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,580
singing from our hearts.

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,430
You're my grandson, so I'm not gonna capture you here.

26
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,670
As for the Marines, I'll give 'em some excuse so don't worry.

27
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,640
Instead of an excuse, let's just say they got away.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,860
Anyway, I'm more of an escort than anything.

29
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,800
Take these two and have a good long chat.

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm going back.

31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,020
Okay, bye.

32
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,920
That was too quick!

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Care more you fool!

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,540
I'm your Grandpa you haven't seen in a long time!

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,890
What do you mean?

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,950
The only thing you've done is hit me!

37
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,510
Even then, I still wanna be loved by my Grandson you idiot!

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,320
That selfishness is definitely a family trait.

39
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:23,330
{\an5}The Extent of the Grand Line and
The 600,000,000 Crew!

40
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,770
But man, that's a pretty wild Grandpa he's got.

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,530
That part about Dragon really surprised me.

42
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,030
It seems there isn't a single average person in their family.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
Where's Luffy?

44
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,070
He's out front talking with Coby.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,500
You alright with that?

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,160
You're friends right?

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,660
It's nostalgic but...

48
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,120
The one who saved Coby was Luffy.

49
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,130
Nami is gone too, ever since she heard what the marines had to say...

50
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,080
Maybe she's being shy.

51
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,320
She went to the pool with Kokoro-san.

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,570
The pool?

53
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,460
The Galley-La Company's employee pool, out back.

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,890
Nami-san in a swimsuit?

55
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,020
I'll go take her something to drink!

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,010
So, you guys went over that mountain to enter the Grand Line too right?

57
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,260
Uh, no.

58
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,140
We didn't pass over Reverse Mountain.

59
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,450
At headquarters, they have ships that are able to move through the calm belt-

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,970
What!? That's unfair!

61
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,740
Of course, they aren't 100% perfect though.

62
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,510
But how!?

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,240
There are Sea Kings there that are bigger than battleships!

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,460
They really messed us up!

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,720
The truth is, the undersides of the ship are covered in a rock known as sea-stone.

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,970
So what about it?

67
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,670
So you see,

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,810
Sea-stone puts out the same kind of energy as the sea,

69
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,160
So to all the fish in the ocean the ship seems-

70
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,650
The sea's energy?

71
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,920
So that's it!

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,750
That way even if they move through the creatures' homes

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,160
The Sea Kings won't even notice the ship's presence!

74
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,770
That way even if they didn't take the entrance at Reverse Mountain,

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,910
They could still enter the Grand Line at will.

76
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,670
As expected of the Marine scientists.

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,370
I got some good information.

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,660
Big sis, big sis!

79
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,140
Aren't you gonna swim?

80
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,490
Hey!

81
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,460
Be quiet for a second Chimney!

82
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,180
This is a rare chance!

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,940
Pirate big sis's so selfish!

84
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm spying right now!

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,740
Is that something you're supposed to yell?

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,540
The person responsible for this groundbreaking research is most certainly the marine's scientist...

87
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,270
Dr. Vegapunk.

88
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,890
He's amazing.

89
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,570
Indeed, he truly is amazing.

90
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,550
Straw Hat, that devil fruit you ate,

91
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,510
He's the one who identified the power it contained.

92
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,260
And he invented the new technology which allows objects to consume devil fruits.

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,140
And that's just in the last few years!

94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,900
Dr. Vegapunk...

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,850
Hmm, he seems pretty amazing.

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,130
Indeed, this world is full of amazing people!

97
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,850
If I hadn't met Luffy-san back then, I wonder what a small world I would live in.

98
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,360
You made me aware of this sea.

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,700
That day, if you hadn't come bursting out from that barrel...

100
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,620
I would certainly still be stuck at work on Alvida's ship.

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,150
That's right!

102
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,090
You were on Alvida's ship weren't you?

103
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,250
Wasn't that hilarious?

104
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
The reason why you got on that ship in the first place!

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,010
What now?

106
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,590
I haven't heard this story.

107
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,650
We're truly grateful.

108
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,010
That's why we want to try and repay Vice-Admiral Garp by-

109
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,260
No way.

110
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,090
I wanna show him what it's like in our shoes.

111
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, that sounds good you evil-idiot!

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,780
What was that?!

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,940
What? Are you really going back already?

114
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,250
Eat with us! Eat!

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,100
We're really enemies...

116
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,180
We can't act friendly together.

117
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,710
Luffy-san!

118
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,680
Do you know what the second half of the Grand Line is known as?

119
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,150
Further beyond the Red Line, the sea becomes more vast.

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,600
That final sea, people call it by one more name...

121
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,370
The New World.

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,540
The New World.

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,950
The sea where those who wish to usher in a new era gather!

124
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,280
The man who controlled that sea was...

125
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,830
The Pirate King!

126
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,250
Luffy-san!

127
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,440
We will certainly meet again there!

128
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,490
And next time I'll capture you!

129
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,610
I'll become even stronger!

130
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,360
One day, in the Navy, I'll...

131
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,510
I'll...

132
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,570
Become a Navy Admiral!

133
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:36,950
No...

134
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,340
S-Sorry.

135
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,160
Sorry, I just got carried away.

136
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,790
I'm embarrassed, just saying I want to become that.

137
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,800
I've just felt kind of inspired since we found you and-

138
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,390
Coby!

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,570
You're gonna fight me, right?

140
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,630
Then of course you'll become that strong!

141
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,380
What else?

142
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,850
B-But an admiral?

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,380
Next time we meet, we'll be even stronger.

144
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,980
Even more amazing!

145
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,910
Why?

146
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,670
It's just a wavering dream I blurted out but...

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,880
Why is he able to believe me wholeheartedly?

148
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,900
What's this?

149
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,760
Are you still a crybaby, Coby?

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,910
That I was able to meet you two again today...

151
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm truly grateful!

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,820
It truly will be a challenge to go after these two!

153
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,770
We're going to keep becoming even stronger!

154
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,040
And in the New World we'll meet again!

155
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,100
Let's go!

156
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,130
Uh, hey!

157
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,130
You two better prepare yourselves!

158
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,980
We've got the guts to surpass you!

159
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,760
Hey, wait up!

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,310
Alright!

161
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,920
No one can stop us now!

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,520
What're you saying?

163
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,510
You've lost your mind!

164
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,480
Luffy, you've made yourself another unbelieveable opponent, haven't you?

165
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,110
Coby's a capable guy. I just knew that.

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,070
Nami-san!

167
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,080
The water-water meat is done!

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,330
Okay!

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,950
Grandma, you're amazing!

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,840
It sure smells good!

171
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,480
Doesn't it?

172
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,730
Now, say 'aaaah'.

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,330
Delicious!

174
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,440
Delicious!

175
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,550
Water-water meat barbeque!

176
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,000
Sogeking!

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,730
When did you-

178
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,490
Alright, eat as much as you like!

179
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,700
Why are you crying?

180
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,950
Shut up!

181
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,450
The smoke just got in my eyes is all.

182
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,020
How is it, Robin-chwan~?

183
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,810
Different from the stocked foods isn't it?

184
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,460
Yes, it's delicious.

185
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,670
Oh, it's them!

186
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,120
Straw Hat-san!

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,380
Have you finally woken up?

188
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,230
Oh, the Franky family!

189
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,340
Come and eat!

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,010
It's a barbeque!

191
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,840
My favorite!

192
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,030
Hey, there's a ton of us, we need to get more meat!

193
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,310
It's Sodom and Gomorrah!

194
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,950
I'm starving.

195
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,030
Me too.

196
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,730
The giants! Heey!

197
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,760
Straw Hat!

198
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,200
So you were awake?!

199
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,400
The Galley-La Company!

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,190
What are you doing at the pool...

201
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,760
Why you shameless girl!

202
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,490
This is a pool, you know.

203
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,200
Gaah, something smells good.

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,920
Iceburg-san!

205
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,670
I absolutely can't let you see this, this woman is some kind of pervert!

206
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,130
Hold on there!

207
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,000
We can't take a break when building a ship.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,810
That's right! So we're gonna take that moment right now!

209
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,310
You're got room for me too right?

210
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,600
Right? Right?

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,060
We were waiting on you Brother!

212
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,240
Alright, let's begin!

213
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,790
The Number One: Sogeking!

214
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,240
I'll sing!

215
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,160
Alright! It's a party!

216
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,560
{\an8}On the Island of Snipers,

217
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,250
{\an8}I was born.

218
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,220
Listen from there, Nico Robin.

219
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,800
It can't be...

220
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,720
Aokiji?

221
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,260
Why didn't you escape like always?

222
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,810
You should have been able to escape from CP9 if you were alone.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
That's because this time was different.

224
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,810
To just let them be killed,

225
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,360
I couldn't do that.

226
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,700
The giant that fought for Ohara
20 years ago, Jaguar D. Saul...

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,890
He was my close friend.

228
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:39,940
That day I respected his wishes, and spared your life.

229
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Therefore I feel I have a responsibility to watch how your life turns out.

230
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,650
But after twenty years without a place of your own,

231
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,850
I felt it was to risky to let such a dangerous bomb continue to roam freely.

232
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,690
Truly, I felt that you finally had to die.

233
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,940
This time, I wanted to finally finish off with what had happened at Ohara.

234
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,570
Of course, there was no way I could have expected the CP9 to be defeated.

235
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,170
Have you finally found your place?

236
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,030
Yes.

237
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,540
What Saul told you, whether it was wrong or right...

238
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,980
From here on, will you show me that answer?

239
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,340
I intend to.

240
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,730
In that case, live strong.

241
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,860
Ohara is not yet forgotten.

242
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,810
Aokiji!

243
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,640
Hey, Robin!

244
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,970
Look over here!

245
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,600
Robin! Over here!

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,060
Robin!

247
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,350
How much meat can you eat?

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,150
That's the greatest Luffy!

249
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,100
Seriously, try and have some manners.

250
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,190
You were just stuffing yourself a second ago.

251
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,120
You wanna try?

252
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,000
As if!

253
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, Robin!

254
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,050
Hey, over here.

255
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,420
Maybe I should try too?

256
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,930
Yeah, do it Robin!

257
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,690
Please stop, Robin-chwan!

258
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,940
She hasn't done anything yet...

259
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,220
Five Elders!

260
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,320
Five Elders, something terrible has happened!

261
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
What is it?

262
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,300
At the New World, the fleet we sent a few days ago was defeated.

263
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,880
Emperor "Red Hair" Shanks and Emperor "Whitebeard" Edward Newgate,

264
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,720
Have finally made direct contact!

265
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,850
What?

266
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,260
Old man!

267
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,350
Old man!

268
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,850
Red Hair wants to have a meeting with you.

269
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,820
Sure, show him in.

270
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,780
But the brat has better got some good booze with him.

271
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,910
Is it true the whole fleet was defeated?

272
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,960
Yeah, it is said.

273
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,820
Have Red Hair and Whitebeard come in contact?

274
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,580
Attention!

275
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,260
Listen up!

276
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,290
I don't know what will happen from here on.

277
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,600
Stay on strict guard and await orders!

278
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,300
Yessir!

279
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
Cease the course!

280
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,310
Rise the sails!

281
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,410
Captain!

282
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,910
We're receiving Red Hair.

283
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,530
Here he comes... Red Hair.

284
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,960
You weaklings better stay back.

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,820
You won't handle it.

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,420
What does that mean?

287
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,480
Nevermind that, just go inside.

288
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,130
What's wrong?

289
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,540
What's happening?

290
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,060
It's already too late.

291
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,740
Don't panic, they're just unconscious.

292
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,220
If you're half-prepared, you won't be able to hold your senses before that man.

293
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,120
As always...

294
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,620
What an insane Haki.

295
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,620
{\an8}Haki: Ambition

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,100
Excuse me.

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,810
I had to be a little threat since it's an enemy ship.

298
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,220
Just seeing your face makes the wound given by that bastard ache again.

299
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,270
I've brought some healing water, I've got no intention to fight.

300
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,900
There's something I want to talk with you about.

301
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,080
And that comes from the one who just showed off their Haki?

302
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,620
You idiot.

303
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Hey! Red Hair!

304
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,750
Bastard, look at what you did!

305
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,450
Oh! If it isn't the first division commander, Marco?

306
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,210
Won't you join my crew?

307
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,420
Shut up!

308
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,170
Old man, should we...?

309
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,380
Yeah, doesn't look like he wants a fight.

310
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,970
Leave us alone.

311
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,020
West Blue liquor, this won't do.

312
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,490
From all of the seas I've been in, there's no liquor that surpasses this water's skin healing properties.

313
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,540
It's liquor from my hometown.

314
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,110
Please, drink it.

315
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,420
Not bad...

316
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,370
Roger,

317
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,110
Garp,

318
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,480
Sengoku...

319
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Only a few of those who knew the seas back then remain.

320
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,550
It's been 22 years, it's only natural.

321
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,020
You've also climbed the ladder...

322
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,940
You were just an apprentice on Gol D. Roger's ship.

323
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,500
You were pretty good on Roger's ship,

324
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,670
With that weird faced partner of yours.

325
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,210
Here we come, Whitebeard!

326
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,120
I hope you're prepared!

327
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,380
I'll rip off that beard of yours!

328
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,430
Who're you calling red nose?!

329
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,470
He was always with you.

330
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,420
Has that funny red nose died?

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
Buggy?

332
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
That takes me back...

333
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,820
The day of the captain's execution, we went our separate ways in Loguetown.

334
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,320
Come with me, Buggy!

335
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Like I'm gonna be your subordinate, idiot!

336
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,910
I heard rumors that he's still a pirate.

337
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,970
It seems like it was just yesterday to me.

338
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,880
There are just a few of the ones who became legends.

339
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,670
The daily duels between you and Hawk-Eyes still sound new in my ears.

340
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:40,420
When a man like you return from East Blue with a lost arm, anyone would be surprised.

341
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,190
What kind of enemy did you give it to?

342
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,890
That left arm of yours.

343
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,680
This...

344
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,570
I wouldn't have taken you with me anyway.

345
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,990
As if you could ever become a pirate.

346
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,050
I will!

347
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,990
Someday I will find crewmates who will beat to this crew.

348
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,440
I'll find the greatest treasure in the world.

349
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,200
And I'll definitely become the Pirate King!

350
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,710
I made a bet...

351
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,250
...on the New Age.

352
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,390
Well, if it was worth it, then fine.

353
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,340
Whitebeard.

354
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,780
I've been through numerous battles, and received many wounds, but...

355
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,100
Right now, the one that aches...

356
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,940
...is this wound.

357
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,440
This one isn't one I got from an adventure, nor received from Hawk-Eyes.

358
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,070
The one who gave me this, was one of yours...

359
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,940
Blackbeard, Teach!

360
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,490
It's not like I was being careless.

361
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,000
Do you see what I'm trying to say?

362
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,950
Whitebeard.

363
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,760
He was quietly waiting for a chance.

364
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,040
He didn't take the title of commander to be renowned.

365
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,070
He wanted to conceal himself.

366
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,450
Up until now he remained hidden under the shadow of the name of Whitebeard.

367
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,580
And in order to gain power, he made his move.

368
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,400
In the end, he aims to get to the top,

369
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,770
With his own will.

370
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,990
He might even come to steal your title.

371
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,910
What do you want me to do?

372
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,920
That's the main question.

373
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,500
Please stop Ace!

374
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,970
Even though he's young, your 2nd division crew commander is a man of trust.

375
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,170
Ace is strong, I know that.

376
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,890
But, that fame and trust can twist things.

377
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,070
This isn't the time for those two to fight yet!

378
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,690
Leave your hands off Blackbeard Teach.

379
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,160
That's my only request.

380
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,790
The old man is laughing.

381
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,330
That's like the way of talking of that funny nose.

382
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:28,270
His crime is... something that should never be done on a pirate ship, murder of another crewmate!

383
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,030
He broke the iron rule.

384
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,510
Since the time he got on my ship, no matter how stupid he was, he became my son.

385
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,690
Where does the soul of a murdered son go to?

386
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,220
I have to show that man that you can't cross this world without morals!

387
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,690
It's my responsibility to show Teach of his foolishness!

388
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,790
Have you got it, moron?

389
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,340
You're a hundred years too soon to instruct me!

390
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,100
No one could have stopped this...

391
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,810
The rampaging point of this age!

392
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,140
Not enough to scare me!

393
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,350
I am Whitebeard!

394
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,130
That red haired bastard! What's he doing to the old man?!

395
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,530
Just take it easy.

396
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,880
He isn't the type of man that does stupid things.

397
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,570
But, it seems something went wrong in the conversation.

398
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,140
Take a look in the sky.

399
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,490
The clouds...

400
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,720
No, the sky has been split in two!

401
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,810
Brother, isn't that Iceburg?

402
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,080
Isn't it?

403
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,850
You're really going at it, Franky.

404
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,590
Hey, why did you come?

405
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,120
Gaah, what about it?

406
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,890
Can't I give you a hand?

407
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,300
Bastard, did you come to interfere with my plan?

408
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,360
You've been doing nothing but dismantling; aren't your skills dulled?

409
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,500
Show me your blueprints.

410
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,730
All of Tom's Workers are present...

411
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,930
Even if we have to build a ship in this empty place.

412
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,930
This is for the Straw Hats!

413
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,680
Should we give you a hand?!

414
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,890
Taking care of such a rushed job alone has gotta be rough.

415
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,350
Is it okay that you do it here instead of in town?

416
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,860
If we're building a replacement for that burnt ship,

417
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,820
All of the employees had to come and lend a hand, no matter what.

418
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,330
You guys!

419
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,160
Every single one of you...!

420
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,670
Such good guys they are.

421
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,530
They are.

422
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,090
You better not slack off!

423
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,630
Alright! Let's show them what the 1st Dock is capable of!

424
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,920
Hey!

425
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,930
Look!

426
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,180
It's today's newspaper!

427
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,240
It shows the events at Enies Lobby.

428
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,370
I-It finally came!

429
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,100
Hey! What's written about it?

430
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,810
It's an article that could decide our fates!

431
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,490
Well... that...

432
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,080
T-That...

433
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,110
About us...

434
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,610
There's nothing recorded.

435
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,720
R-Really?!

436
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,140
Not at all?

437
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,210
There's no mistake!

438
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,910
And we were preparing for a permanent fugitive life!

439
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,830
Thank God!

440
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,740
What an unexpected thing to do.

441
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,530
Hey, take a look!

442
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,700
It's an article about Straw Hat!

443
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,210
It seems he took down the judiciary island.

444
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,720
With this, his bounty will definitely rise!

445
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,640
Enies Lobby is famous for having the sea train running all the way from Water Seven.

446
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,660
It's not far from here.

447
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,010
We might get the chance to meet him again.

448
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,030
To be within our firing range...

449
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,840
How pitiful... an unlucky bunch they are...

450
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,480
Let's go, Captain!

451
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,600
Of course we're going!

452
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,920
Well then, prepare to leave!

453
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,830
Don't get delayed!

454
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,710
Hey!

455
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
Wait a minute, Teach.

456
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,420
I've been looking for you.

457
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,550
What does this mean?

458
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,970
After all the trouble the Franky Family caused.

459
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,650
Could it be that your grandpa didn't want to involve ordinary people and didn't report them?

460
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,250
No... such a thing...

461
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,810
I think not.

462
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,250
It is surely Aokiji's doing...

463
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,460
What an unpredictable man.

464
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,220
No matter what, I'm glad.

465
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:36,800
It's fine for us, but for them to become fugitives would be quite unfortunate.

466
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,020
And in their place, it says some awful things about what we did.

467
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,180
"Declaration of War on the World Government".

468
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,100
They even blame us for burning the island.

469
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,350
With this our bounties will rise.

470
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,740
W-Will I also get a bounty on my head?!

471
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,120
Well, that's very probable, but...

472
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,530
The most badass will be me.

473
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,190
"A Big Star Appears".

474
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,120
What're you getting excited for?!

475
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,700
Franky is building us a ship?!

476
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,210
Oh yeah, you were asleep, right?

477
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,020
Yay, this is great!

478
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,580
How about that? He's a good guy after all!

479
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,890
What kind of ship will it be? I'm looking forward to it!

480
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,310
He was a nice guy, a nice guy...

481
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,310
Then let's use the rest of the money to buy supplies.

482
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,420
Hey, do you think the ship will be huge?

483
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,060
Well since we got here I was wishing for more wide areas.

484
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,230
Where is the 100 million beli that was here?

485
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,780
Oh, that was spent during the party, buying meat and booze.

486
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Spent...?

487
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,680
Our money?!

488
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,780
Wasn't it for our party?

489
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,450
Almost nothing remains!

490
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,700
Well, of course!

491
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,920
Almost everyone in town stayed at that party to the very end.

492
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,540
It sure was fun!

493
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,220
Well, since we'll get our ship, it doesn't matter anymore.

494
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,460
And I thought of getting some wonderful furniture for the ship...

495
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,940
Let's go to the canal to look for some.

496
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,930
Hey, Robin, since I'm out to play, can you lend me some money?

497
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,770
I can't take it anymore!

498
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,260
You're not getting anything!

499
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,780
Understood!

500
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,910
Usopp?

501
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,470
What's that?

502
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,570
Luffy, you want me to come back now?

503
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,530
Geez, it can't be helped.

504
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,770
If I'm not there, you can't do anything.

505
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,810
Alright, since you insist, I'll come back to the crew.

506
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,770
Maybe it's best if I say it this way.

507
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,620
This is the 23rd pattern...

508
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,000
Hey, Chopper, we're having nice weather today.

509
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,230
Let's go fishing!

510
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,550
Hey, Luffy, what about you?

511
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,370
This one is also good.

512
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,320
The "act as if nothing ever happened" strategy.

513
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,010
Or...

514
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,950
I've decided to go to Elbaf!

515
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,370
What? Please don't go!

516
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,440
I was kidding.

517
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
I can understand your feelings.

518
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,850
Will you be coming back, Usopp?!

519
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,940
Of course, idiot!

520
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,200
Geez, you guys sure love me!

521
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
What is he doing?

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,030
That idiot.

523
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,100
Iceburg, you seem tired, how about some sleep?

524
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,170
That would be you!

525
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,930
I'm beaten...

526
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,420
My body...is hot...

527
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,760
I'm still alive...

528
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,810
At this rate... I will die...

529
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,750
No one's here.

530
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,700
An abandoned scrapped ship.

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,670
Scrap...

532
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,660
Iron pieces...

533
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,670
A place which calms me down...

534
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,090
First, if I don't do something about this unmoving body...

535
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,600
The log is set.

536
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,260
The log pose is pointing to the next island.

537
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,990
Then, all that's left is to get on the ship.

538
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,110
It'll be fun!

539
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,440
That's right, since it's going to be a surprise, he told us not to go and see it.

540
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,950
You guys, if you follow that log, do you know where you will arrive?

541
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,830
No, where?

542
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,250
It seems to be pointing down a little.

543
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,330
That's right.

544
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,680
The next island is...

545
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,040
The bottom of the sea paradise,

546
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,380
Fish-man Island.

547
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,260
F-F-F-Fish-man Island?! At last?!

548
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,180
Eh?! What's wrong, Sanji?!

549
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,960
Fish-man Island?

550
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
How complicated...

551
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,150
Oh yeah, because of what happened in your village...

552
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,860
But, that fish-man was a pirate, right?

553
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,530
That's correct, you really did understand it, right, idiot?

554
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,620
Even though you're stupid.

555
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,800
Fish-man Island is a famous landmark on the Grand Line!

556
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,270
The world's most beautiful mermaids draw arcs in the sea.

557
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,950
A dream kingdom where you can coexist with the fishes.

558
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,850
Is that so?!

559
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,420
Amazing!

560
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,070
But, can't we dream?

561
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,400
That's what we pirates do!

562
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
There are young ones too!

563
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,780
However, getting to the paradise isn't that simple.

564
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,740
I'm worried about this "bottom of the sea" concept, though...

565
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,580
We'll know once we go there.

566
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,020
The problem isn't there.

567
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,000
Take a look at the most recent newspaper front page.

568
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,550
What's this...?

569
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,750
"Once again this month, 14 ships have disappeared."

570
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,950
What does this mean?

571
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,220
That triangular zone is...

572
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,470
The Florian Triangle.

573
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,210
It's an area you're forced to pass through to get to the paradise.

574
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,730
Every year over 100 ships disappear in that sea for unknown reasons...

575
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,720
Then, much later, the ships are found without any of the sailors.

576
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,440
There are eyewitness reports of a ghost ship carrying those deceased ones who sailed in that sea.

577
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,480
Ghosts appear?! That's scary!

578
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,410
Will we see living skeletons?!

579
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,290
What're you imagining?

580
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,290
No!

581
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,640
I definitely don't want to encounter or see them!

582
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,610
Such an awful ship!

583
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,480
What could happen in that sea?

584
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,230
Who knows...

585
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,780
Anything could happen there.

586
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,080
Those who enter that sea never come back, that's why I don't know...

587
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,530
It's a foggy, deep, dark sea...

588
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,760
Be careful...

589
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:54,070
Anyway, before entering that extremely disastrous, dangerous sea, you better be firmly prepared.

590
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,070
Ghost ships that are mere shadows of what were once merchant ships or pirate ships...

591
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,830
Are indispensable parts of the legends of treasure ships.

592
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,960
Let's search for the ghost ships!

593
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,460
Leave it to me!

594
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,960
Eh?! I don't want to!

595
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,580
I intend to stock up with lots of provisions in case we have an accident, so don't worry.

596
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,290
A treasure ship?

597
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,430
There might be swords as well.

598
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,220
Pirate bros!

599
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,330
Straw Hat!

600
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,860
You need something?

601
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,530
Brother Franky told us to come and call for everyone!

602
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,620
The dream ship is complete!

603
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,120
It looks great!

604
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,320
Is it complete already?!

605
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,890
That was fast!

606
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,400
The five top-notch shipwrights stayed up all night building it!

607
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,460
Building it!

608
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,170
Alright! Then let's go!

609
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:50,840
Yeah!

610
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,340
Straw Hat-san!

611
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,640
Straw Hat-san!

612
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,640
The Franky family!

613
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,530
What's wrong with you guys?

614
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,750
You're out of breath.

615
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,380
To be honest, we just heard about it!

616
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,780
Did you see the wanted posters?!

617
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,020
Wanted posters?

618
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,780
You have been given an incredible bounty, Straw Hat-san!

619
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,150
Also, everyone else has one as well!

620
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,710
Me too?!

621
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,270
Alright!

622
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,530
Me too?!

623
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,830
Me too?!

624
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,290
Instead of talking, see it for yourselves.

625
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,040
All seven of you now have bounties!

626
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,710
Straw Hat Luffy
 Bounty 300,000,000 beli.

627
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,180
It went up!

628
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,650
Pirate Hunter Zoro 
 Bounty 120,000,000 beli.

629
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,560
Burglar Cat Nami 
 Bounty 16,000,000 beli.

630
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,240
No wa-

631
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,900
Cotton Candy Lover Chopper (Pet)
 Bounty 50 beli.

632
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,650
Fifty...?

633
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,160
The Devil's Child Nico Robin 
 Bounty 80,000,000 beli.

634
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,750
Who's that...?

635
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,720
Black Leg Sanji (Attempt to take a photo failed)
Bounty 77,000,000 beli.

636
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,930
There's also one for Sogeking.

637
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:26,190
Y-You have my sympathies and I'm sure you have many things to say to each other but,

638
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,440
Please wait.

639
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,810
What we're requesting, is this.

640
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,980
Please look at this.

641
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,020
Franky!

642
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,990
Cyborg Franky
 Bounty 44,000,000 beli.

643
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,120
This is terrible, Brother has a bounty on his head!

644
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,630
It's terrible!

645
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,250
That's right.

646
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,760
We somehow managed to avoid this, but Brother couldn't...

647
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,300
Brother's life will be in danger if he stays in Water Seven.

648
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,210
If he gets caught this time, we won't have the power to save him!

649
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,230
Surely, Brother must be worried about us and doesn't want to leave the island.

650
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,900
That's why we all came to talk with you...!

651
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,750
Straw Hat-san, I beg of you!

652
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,660
Even if it is against his own will, take Brother out to the sea!

653
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,360
That man was the child of a pirate to begin with!
