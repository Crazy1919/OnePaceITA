We're fallen angels,

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
we'll fire arrows into your dreams.

00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,440

Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes.

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,780
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth.

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,700
Surreal fallen angels,

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,570
singing from our hearts.

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Usopp is coming back?!

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,910
Yeah.

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,970
He was at the coast practicing.

28
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,260
Really?!

29
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,640
So, that's how it is.

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,770
Then, I'm going to get him back right away!

31
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,100
You really seem unaffected.

32
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,550
Usopp is coming back!

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,610
Wait up you guys!

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,060
I won't forgive anyone who tries to bring him back here.

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,990
Why?!

36
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,870
No matter what happens, it isn't you who should behave modestly, Luffy.

37
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,960
I won't accept him until he comes and begs.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,450
Zoro!

39
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,440
Hey! Why're you being so...

40
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,440
What are you up to?!

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,320
Shut up!

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,170
No matter how Luffy and Usopp felt when they started to quarrel...

43
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,300
No matter who was right...!

44
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,680
After demanding a man to man duel,

45
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,180
You gotta devote yourself to the outcome of the battle!

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,610
And, after losing,

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,950
he left on his own accord.

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
Listen everyone!

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,860
Even though he's an idiot, he has the title of Captain.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,620
The crew would be better without someone who doesn't show respect for this guy.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,080
A crew that loses the respect for their captain, is sure to collapse.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,610
Listen!

53
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,900
You can act easy going as you usually do but,

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,800
If even for an instant, the guy who is my leader let others step over him,

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,730
Next time, it is me who will leave this crew.

56
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,980
Eh?! That won't settle down this conversation!

57
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,980
If that idiot wants to come back, it's fine.

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,600
However, if he doesn't make a distinction of the current matters,

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,850
and is acting for self-interest,

60
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,240
then I definitely won't forgive him!

61
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,460
If so, it's better for you to leave Usopp on this island!

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,600
Wait up, Zoro.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,620
It is true that he made some mistakes but,

64
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,690
If you just tell him what you just said when he gets back...

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,440
Is leaving the crew such an easy thing to do?!

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
No...

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,460
But...

68
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,890
Nami-san.

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,990
It is unfortunate but,

70
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,720
just this once, what he's saying is right.

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,470
We also can't keep trusting a guy who started such a thing on a whim.

72
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,550
It's simple...

73
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,950
If Usopp's first thing to say is a deep apology, fine.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,540
If it isn't...

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Then, there's no place for him to go back to.

76
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,130
What we're doing isn't a childish pirates game!

77
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,000
See ya, Usopp.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,190
I've had fun until now.

79
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,690
You're right...

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,670
We did separate once.

81
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,420
There are still many days left until the ship is ready.

82
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,700
We'll wait for him quietly.

83
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:57,920
{\an5}The Astonishing Thousand Sunny and
Usopp's Tearful Apology!

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,460
Vice-admiral Garp!

85
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,360
We've found the Strawhat crew's location!

86
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,670
They're at the southeast coast!

87
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,710
Currently, they're on the scrap island making arrangements to depart!

88
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,310
We'll go after them immediately!

89
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,840
Everyone get on the ship!

90
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,550
Yes!

91
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,240
Vice-Admiral Garp, this is quite embarassing after such an emotive farewell with Luffy-san and the others.

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,300
If you've any complaints, tell them to Sengoku!

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,210
He's the one who sent us here after getting angry!

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,350
He's so full of himself...

95
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,820
You were the one who said "Because he's my grandson" in the Den-Den Mushi after all.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,740
You keep your mouth shut! Amateur.

97
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,230
A-Admiral, is it really okay for you to stay like this?

98
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,720
It's troublesome to go back on my bike...

99
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,630
Well, I'll just keep my hands off this.

100
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,420
I don't think that's a good idea since we're going to battle and all.

101
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,220
Alright! I'm going back to my friends!

102
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,370
The ship must be complete already.

103
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,230
Everyone must be waiting for me!

104
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,770
All what's left is to go back to the crew in the most natural way.

105
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,420
What, after all they're my pals.

106
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,570
I have 100 pattern strategies after all.

107
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,020
As expected this is the best one I have for my "first thing to say" speech.

108
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,080
Since you're all crying out and begging, I'll be glad to come back as Vice-Captain!

109
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,370
Thank you, Vice-Captain Usopp!

110
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,520
Anything you say are words that pleases me to come back!

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,220
As expected of me!

112
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,970
Truly a man who can raise the ones who are down!

113
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,160
Everyone's love for me will increase more and more after this adversity!

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,860
We'll live happily!

115
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,810
Alright! Hurry up!

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,770
This is a sad farewell!

117
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,490
Water Metropolis Water Seven!

118
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,990
We're off!

119
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,590
Brother!

120
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,620
The Franky Family is immortal!

121
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,740
Hey! Luffy!

122
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,120
Luffy!

123
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,620
Are you really sure of this, Straw Hat?

124
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,500
We're still waiting for one more person.

125
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,690
I've waited...

126
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:16,730
Ever since I heard everything about it from Sanji in that Galley-la room.

127
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,140
We waited for him the entire time in that place, but he didn't come.

128
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,850
This is the answer.

129
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,350
I think he also will be pleased with this.

130
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,030
It's not like he quit being a pirate, so we might run into him on the coming seas.

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,870
Damn it! The Navy found us already!

132
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,620
Grandpa?!

133
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,160
It's Vice-Admiral Garp's warship!

134
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,250
Brother! Don't look back, escape!

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,210
Hey Luffy! Can you hear me?!

136
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,530
Grandpa here! Grandpa here!

137
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,590
Answer if you can hear me!

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,940
Hey Grandpa! What's wrong with you?!

139
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,580
Didn't you say you weren't going to capture us here?!

140
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,040
Well, a lot of things happened!

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,830
I'm sorry but you're gonna die in this sea!

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,340
There's no apology I can give you but,

143
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,400
I'll take care of you by myself!

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,690
Hand me the cannonball.

145
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,660
Y-Yes.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
What's he trying to do?

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,030
Fist...

148
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,530
Meteor!

149
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,110
H-He just shot a cannonball at us with his bare hands!

150
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,030
That flew much faster than with a normal cannon!

151
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,720
As if it were a baseball pitch!

152
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,310
My power has decreased lately.

153
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,870
We have no choice! We'll have to escape!

154
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,190
The new ship might get blown up!

155
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,370
Bring 1000 more cannonballs!

156
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,610
Yes!

157
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,100
This is bad!

158
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,820
This time many more are coming!

159
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,800
The Fist Meteor Shower?!

160
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,810
Yeah.

161
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,870
There's no ship that can withstand that when he uses it!

162
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,460
Well then, shall we begin, kiddies.

163
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,290
Full speed ahead!

164
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,410
We'll smash those cannonballs!

165
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,090
Got it!

166
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,470
Damn it! Is he really not coming?!

167
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,350
What is he doing?

168
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,600
He's here!

169
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,030
Usopp came!

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,750
Hey, everyone! Usopp came!

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,020
Really?

172
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,980
Yeah!

173
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,760
Move! Move!

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,690
Please move!

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,010
Move a little please!

176
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,790
Hey, Nose-Bro!

177
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,540
What're you doing here?!

178
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,810
What's going on?!

179
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,990
The marines haven't come, so why's the ship leaving?!

180
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,800
I was pretty sure you were on it!

181
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,110
What're you guys doing?!

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,930
The great me is still here!

183
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,350
Why?

184
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,330
Why?

185
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,280
Why?!

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,770
Even after the quarrel I was fighting alongside you all the time!

187
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,860
There's no way you have forgotten...

188
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,200
That the king of snipers under all those activities, Sogeking, is me!

189
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,710
Did you forget about me just because I changed my appearance?!

190
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,800
Wait!

191
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,090
Hey! The stairs are broken, be careful!

192
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
What's wrong? Hey!

193
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:48,060
Hey guys! Be at ease, I'm coming back right away!

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,540
You idiots!

195
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,650
Stop already!

196
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,790
Rubber...

197
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,140
Balloon!

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,000
Usopp came, Luffy!

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Usopp is here!

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,530
Protect the ship!

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,050
Hey! Be happy, it's me!

202
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,530
Chopper, we're having nice weather today.

203
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,960
Let's go fishing!

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
I guess that's out of the question.

205
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,580
By the way, I have some good news!

206
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,570
When I get back I'm willing to take the position of Vice-Captain!

207
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,000
How is that? Hey!

208
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,960
Hey! Luffy! Everyone!

209
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,060
I understand!

210
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,560
You're so happy that you can't stop crying, right?!

211
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,270
That's it, right?!

212
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,210
Luffy.

213
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,390
I must not stay with you,

214
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,320
I brought you nothing but trouble after all.

215
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,910
You guys, don't tell me you actually believed that joke back then?!

216
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,960
We've known each other for a long time now.

217
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,070
There's no way I can be serious about such a thing!

218
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,580
We argued quite a lot, but we're still friends!

219
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,920
Let's leave the past behind!

220
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,930
Hey! Say something!

221
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,270
Stop messing around everyone!

222
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,650
Luffy, Usopp is calling for us!

223
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,700
I don't hear him.

224
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,180
Zoro!

225
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,290
I can't hear anything!

226
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,160
Liar! You can hear him!

227
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,830
Stop joking.

228
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,040
What's going on...

229
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,950
Do you really mean to leave without me?

230
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I see... good enough.

231
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,880
If that's how you want it,

232
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,790
I have only one more thing to tell you...

233
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,520
Wherever I'm headed from now on...

234
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,760
is none of your business.

235
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm leaving this crew!

236
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,490
I'm sorry!

237
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,360
I'm sorry for my stubbornness!

238
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,210
I was wrong!

239
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,710
Usopp!

240
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,440
Even though I was stubborn until now...!

241
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,720
Even though I said I was leaving the crew...!

242
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,180
I want to change all that, but I can't!

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,890
I can't, so I beg of you!

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,280
Please take me back with you guys!

245
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,730
Just one more time...!

246
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,160
Let me be your crewmate!

247
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
Luffy...

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,350
You idiot!

249
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,720
Hurry up and grab on!

250
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,230
You're the idiot!

251
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,190
You two guys are pitiful.

252
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,240
We are finally complete!

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,830
Let's hurry up and get outta this bombardment to go for more adventures, men!

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,200
Do your best, town heroes!

255
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,550
They'll be crushed before they can get away!

256
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,300
Hey! You shouldn't be cheering them on!

257
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,220
Don't give up! Straw Hats!

258
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,790
Run! Run! Run!

259
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,660
Brother!

260
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,220
What the...?

261
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,140
W-What's going on?!

262
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,490
They're furling the sails?

263
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,670
Have they given up?

264
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,870
Given up?

265
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,860
It's not that, but...

266
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,310
What're you up to, Luffy?

267
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,140
Hurry up! Furl the sails!

268
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,850
Hey! Are you really sure about this, Franky?

269
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,360
Idiot! You gotta trust this ship!

270
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,750
That's right! You gotta trust, idiot!

271
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,590
Idiot! Moron!

272
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,120
Usopp, just a while ago you were...

273
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,130
Well... it's okay...

274
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,270
Help out, you guys!

275
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,810
A name?!

276
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,780
At a time like this?!

277
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,860
That's right, a ship without a name won't be any good at sailing.

278
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,490
Well, it's gotta be Lion-like.

279
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,420
Alright!

280
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,700
I just thought of an awesome name for it!

281
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,310
The Bear!

282
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,970
The Polar Bear Lion!

283
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,640
That's such a weird name for a ship!

284
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Then, The Tiger Wolf Lion!

285
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,400
Stop that animal enumeration!

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,490
It's like some sort of curse!

287
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,960
Squid! Octopus! Chimpanzee!

288
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,410
Without Lion on it?!

289
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,990
Well, Lion is good for a ship.

290
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,050
Even though, the guys from Galley-La didn't get it.

291
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,160
This big head should do fine.

292
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,370
Yeah, it's a nice sunflower!

293
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,020
That's not it, idiots!

294
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,570
Well, I don't blame you for your mistake...

295
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,940
But, this is the ship the future Pirate King will ride.

296
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,410
That's what you were hoping for, right Franky?

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,550
That's right.

298
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,390
One appropriate for sailing the seas like a wild beast and reaching the summit!

299
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,760
A wonderful sun indeed.

300
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,320
That's not it, idiot!

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,490
A strong ship as bright as the sun that can cheerfully overcome 1000 seas...

302
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,900
Something fit for those words.

303
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,090
I told you no, Idiot-burg!

304
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,180
How does this name for the ship sound, Franky?

305
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,380
The Pirate Ship...

306
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,160
Thousand Sunny!

307
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,920
That's so cool!

308
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,760
That's much better than the Dango Gorilla Lion name I just thought of!

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,150
Are you playing Scrabble?!

310
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,820
That's even better than the Lionel Master name I thought of.

311
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,200
Better than my Being of Darkness...

312
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,170
And my Monsieur Sunflower.

313
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,140
Have you all lost your minds?!

314
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,330
A ship that can sail a thousand seas sounds nice...

315
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,020
So does the sunny part.

316
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,630
Wait up you guys!

317
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,330
This is only the beginning.

318
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,910
The certain name for it is one I prepared!

319
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,560
Listen!

320
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,010
This ship's name will be...!

321
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,640
Let's go with the Old Man Iceburg name, I like it!

322
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,650
The New Battle Franky Lion Gang Champion!

323
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,850
Thousand Sunny, is a good name.

324
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,850
Lion Gang Champion!

325
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,700
Agreed!

326
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,120
It's a pleasure, Sunny!

327
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,770
Now that the name is decided, our trip is finally underway.

328
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,080
You're right.

329
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,860
Hey, Franky!

330
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,880
What're you complaining about over there?!

331
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,900
Hurry up and shake off this so called secret weapon!

332
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,230
Yeah, make haste!

333
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,070
The warship has almost caught up with us!

334
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,640
I know! Shut up!

335
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,090
Take one last look at this beautiful Water Metropolis.

336
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,600
In moments, you won't even be able to see this island's shadow!

337
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,860
I see.

338
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,130
Grandpa!

339
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,580
Also, Coby and...!

340
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm glad I had the chance to see you after a long time!

341
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,560
Say my name!

342
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,880
What are you talking about, Luffy?!

343
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,020
There're still many cannonballs left!

344
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,070
Fist...

345
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,310
Meteor!

346
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,760
It's no use!

347
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,740
From now own, we'll be serious about escaping!

348
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,450
Let's meet again someday!

349
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,490
Luffy-san is so cool!

350
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,450
Bastard!

351
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,950
You're the son of my son and yet you dare understimate me, Luffy!

352
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,290
V-Vice-admiral Garp, please calm down!

353
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,410
Old Man Ice!

354
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,740
We got the name for the ship!

355
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,000
Thanks for such a great name!

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone! Thanks for everything!

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,890
We're going now!

358
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,390
Sounds like he's saying something!

359
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,300
I can't hear him.

360
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,350
It seems those who are pirates can't set off quietly.

361
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,300
Well, here we go!

362
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,940
The giant air cannon strengthened with the treasure wood Adam!

363
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,950
The Miracle Emergency Acceleration Device!

364
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,790
If you dare underestimate me...!

365
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,810
R-Run! Luffy-san!

366
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,700
You'll get killed!

367
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,050
Franky, hurry up!

368
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,330
You'll get hurt!

369
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,140
We're dead!

370
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,410
Coup de...

371
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,410
{\an8}French: Shot

372
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,520
Burst!

373
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,540
The ship...!

374
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,280
Got away flying!

375
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,490
They made it...

376
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,210
Awesome!

377
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,830
I remember this sensation!

378
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,540
Merry.

379
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,450
It uses three barrels of cola, but it can send us flying 1 km away.

380
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,450
There's not a single thing the Going Merry you were riding could do that this ship can't!

381
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,920
It's better in many ways!

382
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,580
However, that ship's brave soul lives in The Thousand Sunny!

383
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,710
If it gets damaged, I'll fix it up as good as new!

384
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,010
Anything related to the ship's maintenance and weapons, you can leave them to me!

385
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,680
Starting today, this is your ship!

386
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,210
Geez...

387
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,790
They got away...

388
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,470
As expected from my grandson.

389
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,270
He decided not to come with us after all.

390
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,820
It seems so.

391
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,750
However, the King of Snipers promised that everyone will visit Elbaf someday.

392
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,790
I'm looking forward to it.

393
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,510
We can wait patiently; a Giant's lifespan is 300 years after all.

394
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,290
That was some work!

395
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,790
Indeed.

396
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,490
Well, time to go back to headquarters.

397
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,470
We're definitely coming too!

398
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,400
There's still much work to be done!

399
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,740
Let's go back to the station.

400
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,200
Chimney, Gonbe.

401
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,520
Well then...

402
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,190
What would Brother do?

403
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,720
No idea.

404
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,510
We just did as Brother said.

405
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,960
We'll starve to death.

406
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,740
Iceburg!

407
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
I thought this would happen...

408
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,650
W-What do you want?!

409
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,840
Why did you come here?!

410
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,490
If you're looking for a job, I can give you one.

411
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,160
Send one guy per day to the Galley-La office.

412
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,950
A-Are you sure, Ice...?!

413
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,670
No!

414
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,850
Brother!

415
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,840
New Brother!

416
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,890
Stop that.

417
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,630
In the Grand Line

418
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,630
on an Island somewhere

419
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,360
Commodore Smoker!

420
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,630
Good work!

421
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,900
You say this pirate was worth 50 million?

422
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
Too easy...

423
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,510
What's happening to the army standards?

424
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,080
Geez...

425
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,640
Day after day is the same...

426
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,210
Smoker-san!

427
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,250
Ensign Tashigi!

428
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,120
Have you seen the wanted posters?!

429
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,980
The Straw Hats...

430
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,980
Who are you talking to?

431
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,570
I-I'm sorry.

432
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,420
Wear your glasses, idiot!

433
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,420
The Grand Line

434
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,420
Sand Kingdom Alabasta

435
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,420
W-What...?!

436
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,080
Nico Robin?!

437
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,590
What is Miss All Sunday doing in Luffy-kun's crew?!

438
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,730
She's indeed one mysterious woman but...

439
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,670
If this reaches Vivi-sama's ears, she'll be really sad.

440
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,520
Oh? That? I knew, but...

441
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,400
It's no big deal.

442
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
No big deal?!

443
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,330
We thought you'd be the most shocked about this!

444
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,230
You won't understand what Luffy-san is thinking even if you were very close to him.

445
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,000
It's no use thinking about it.

446
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,260
However, I can believe in everything they do.

447
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,480
He's the man who's gonna be the Pirate King.

448
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,660
He's on a different scale than us.

449
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,000
What tolerance!

450
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,550
You sure have grown up, Vivi-sama!

451
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,650
Hey, why're you crying?

452
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,230
A marine is a marine...

453
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,820
As long as the Navy is an organization, there's a limit to doing what I want.

454
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,160
The most essential thing now is rank.

455
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:06,120
After the events at Enies Lobby, all the pirates in the world will start ceding the way to the Straw Hats.

456
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,970
Yes.

457
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,520
I swear upon my pride...

458
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,250
I'll definitely crush them in the New World!

459
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,630
Everybody!

460
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,470
Ready?!

461
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,070
Yeah!

462
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,830
Then, for the return of Robin and Usopp,

463
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,090
And for our new crewmates, Franky and...

464
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,740
The pirate ship Thousand Sunny!

465
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,800
Cheers!

466
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,450
Cheers!

467
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,420
Let's go! Our next step is Fish-man Island!
