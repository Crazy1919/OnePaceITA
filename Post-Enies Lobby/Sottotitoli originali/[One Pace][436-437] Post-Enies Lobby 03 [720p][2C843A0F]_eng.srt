We're fallen angels,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,400
we'll fire arrows into your dreams.

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,440
into the cobalt blue?

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes.

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,780
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth.

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,740
Surreal fallen angels,

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,560

Franky Departs!

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,560
You guys, have you made up your minds about Usopp?

27
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,770
This is a matter of pride...

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,180
I know that.

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,980
How long are you gonna stay depressed?

30
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,090
Shut up!

31
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,250
Why am I the only one with a drawn picture?!

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,380
That's an amazing amount for the first time.

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,780
Which part of this picture looks like me?!

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,150
It looks exactly like you...

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,150
Which part of this is me?!

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,620
∆ □ x ∑ ≠ € җ Ө ☼

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,160
I can't understand your words...

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,470
I'll be the laughingstock of the whole world's ladies...

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,340
I was tricked...

40
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,430
He said he was the town's magazine reporter.

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,470
The picture turned out cute though...

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,890
I also got a bounty after all...

43
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,770
I'm also a pirate!

44
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,860
I fought like a true man!

45
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,130
I gotta object to these 50 belly!

46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,390
Well, try harder next time!

47
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,060
Hurry up!

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,110
Don't forget anything!

49
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,480
As soon as we get the ship and Franky, we depart!

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,980
Luffy, Sanji isn't moving.

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,440
Just forget about that curly guy.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,660
Are you leaving already, pirate guys?

53
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,490
Exceptions among exceptions, aren't they?

54
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,870
For them all to have bounties in such a small crew is...

55
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,630
The total bounty is over 600 million.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,420
By the way...

57
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,200
This man called Black Leg...

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
Why is there no photo of him?

59
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,090
That...

60
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,220
I certainly took it, but...

61
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,480
When I looked at the developed film, I was surprised...

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,270
This is the picture...

63
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,810
It turned out weird...!

64
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,270
Did you take off...

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,590
the lens cap?

66
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,170
Brother!

67
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,240
We called them here!

68
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,450
Brother, where are you?!

69
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,340
They came?

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,410
Oh! There's something huge over there!

71
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,520
Is that it?!

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,420
Hey! We came, Franky!

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,780
Please give us the ship!

74
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,340
Oh! Old man Ice!

75
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
You came...

76
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,350
Unfortunately, Franky isn't around...

77
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,990
However, the ship is complete.

78
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,580
I'll show it to you in his place.

79
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,170
This ship is amazing.

80
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,400
My eyes were shocked when I saw the amazing blueprints; it's one that can sail over any sea.

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,800
With this ship, sailing to the end of the world won't be a dream.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,580
Hurry and show it to us!

83
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,660
Please!

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,910
That was a message from Franky, Straw Hat.

85
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,500
If you're going to become the Pirate King someday...

86
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,200
You have to ride this king of beasts!

87
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,320
Amazing!

88
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
Is this...?

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,370
I see.

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh! So huge and cool!

91
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,770
It could break out of so many places!

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,140
Oh! Are you really gonna give us this?!

93
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,820
It's double the size of Merry!

94
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,630
What a big sail!

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,440
Is it a sloop?!

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,700
Show me the kitchen! The kitchen!

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,810
A splendid ship!

98
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,980
I wonder what kind of big flower is that on the ship's bow.

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,950
Well, I was sure it was a lion.

100
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,120
The inside is also awesome!

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,870
It's a lawn deck!

102
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,830
Feels so good!

103
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,510
A slide!

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,710
You can also do gardening.

105
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,420
Nice for relaxing.

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
Where's the kitchen?

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,400
It must really have mobility with that huge gaff sail!

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,590
It's called a brigantine sail.

109
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,120
A sloop is a ship that can sail beyond people's imaginations.

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
It lives and dies by the order of the navigator.

111
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,690
I'll make my skills roar! I'll do my best!

112
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,710
I also want to take a look.

113
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,300
It has the refrigerator with a lock that I saw in my dreams!

114
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,240
Even a gigantic oven!

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,790
Franky, thank you!

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,160
This ship is the best!

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,850
Hey, old man Ice.

118
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,340
Where's Franky?

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,540
I want to thank him.

120
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,170
It seems he doesn't want to see you.

121
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,050
You want to invite him as your shipwright, right?

122
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,960
Yeah.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,410
You got it right.

124
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,220
I've decided he will be my shipwright!

125
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,810
That might be the problem.

126
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,410
He doesn't want to?

127
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,710
The opposite.

128
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,410
If he was invited face to face he wouldn't be able to refuse.

129
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,070
That's why he went to hide.

130
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,940
Well, perhaps his true feelings are to go with you guys out at sea.

131
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,050
You must know pretty well how much he cares for this dream ship he's giving to you.

132
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh! There's an aquarium in this place?!

133
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,530
An aquarium? Amazing!

134
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,790
Franky really has a liking for you all from the bottom of his heart.

135
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,120
But he's always thought of it as his duty, staying on this island.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Duty?

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,750
Indeed, if you ask me, it's just a stupid obsession.

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,720
If you really want him to go with you...

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,180
The only method to choose is...

140
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,400
to use force to get him.

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,350
That's the only method for his release.

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,980
By force?

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,820
I want him to go, but...

144
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,700
Is that really okay?!

145
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,490
Brother! Why did you come back?

146
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,360
Do I need a reason?

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the Franky House!

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,660
It's my house!

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,580
But...

150
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,710
Are you sure of what you're saying, Brother?!

151
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,160
Doesn't Brother want to go with
Straw Hat-san and the others?!

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
What a stupid thing to say...

153
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,420
Of course not...!

154
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,650
Hey look!

155
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,430
With skills like yours you can't even build a house.

156
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,390
We just came from asking
Straw Hat-san and the others,

157
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,670
To take Brother out to the sea!

158
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,190
Idiot!

159
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,190
Mind your own business!

160
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,610
But that guy has already decided to take you as his shipwright!

161
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,240
Why do I have to become a pirate?!

162
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,200
You'd know if you could see it!

163
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,580
This is the first time we've seen Brother build a ship, but...

164
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,650
We were amazed you could make such a happy face.

165
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
I've never seen Brother have so much fun.

166
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,360
Brother.

167
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,720
You knew the Straw Hats were looking for a shipwright, right?

168
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,890
That's why you ran away, right?!

169
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,180
Look at this, Brother!

170
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,540
A wanted poster!

171
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,360
As I thought, it came out.

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,030
It's no use staying with us anymore!

173
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,450
We don't want to be a burden to you!

174
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,820
Stop being so cocky!

175
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,540
What about the marines?!

176
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,660
I'm the one who picked you up from these backstreets when you were dying!

177
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,170
If I'm not here you probably can't probably survive by yourselves...

178
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,390
I got his pants!

179
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390
Pants?

180
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,890
Why the pants...?

181
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,300
I see!

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,980
Don't give them back!

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,670
Keep passing the pants!

184
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,720
Don't give them back no matter what!

185
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,470
Give back my pants, damn it!

186
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,000
Those are my best!

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,980
Scatter!

188
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,900
Let's go!

189
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,240
Fine then!

190
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,840
He's coming after us!

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,770
You know that even you all can't do anything against me!

192
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,690
Even if it's just one of you!

193
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,560
Deliver them to Straw Hat-san!

194
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,990
Get them to the scrap island!

195
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,670
Strong Right!

196
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,420
Run!

197
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,390
To southeast!

198
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,520
What's with all the ruckus?!

199
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,940
A pervert...!

200
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,650
Franky is rampaging!

201
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,790
Again?!

202
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,390
No! The town could be destroyed!

203
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,520
Wait, damn it!

204
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,360
Hey! That guy isn't wearing anything!

205
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,000
Ah! Look at the...!

206
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,620
Get the kids inside the houses!

207
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,040
Don't let them see the pervert!

208
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,240
Strong Right!

209
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,700
He's committing a crime, arrest him!

210
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,920
D-Deliver the pants!

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,990
Get on the cornetfish!

212
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,390
Alright! Go!

213
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,900
The backstreets has become a battlefield!

214
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,150
Damn, my leg is...!

215
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,690
It's no use!

216
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,180
Is this it?

217
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,650
Hey! Pass them over here!

218
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,410
Throw them here!

219
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,360
Straw Hat-san!

220
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,270
Straw Hat!

221
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Definitely received them!

222
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,510
You...!

223
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,550
Straw Hat!

224
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,220
Did you like the ship?!

225
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Yeah!

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
I've never seen such an amazing ship before!

227
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,230
Thanks!

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,240
Pervert! Get out of here!

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,260
Give him the death penalty!

230
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,230
Perverted bastard!

231
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,240
Of course!

232
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,510
It includes my super designs!

233
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,910
It's the answer to all of your requests!

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,490
Did you see the Soldier Dock System I invented?!

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,340
Not yet!

236
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,840
It'll surely be the one you'll like the most!

237
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,680
What about the fish pond?

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,630
I saw it!

239
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,580
If you put the fish you've caught in the fish pond, you can see them in the large aquarium in the room below.

240
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,380
It's an aquarium observation room!

241
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,880
Everyone should have a meal there once.

242
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,190
You can always eat fresh fish!

243
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,470
I'm looking forward to it!

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,160
That ship, for me and also for you is...

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,770
The supreme dream ship!

246
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,560
You bastard...!

247
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,740
Give back my pants!

248
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,080
Chopper!

249
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,370
Right!

250
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,380
H-Here he comes!

251
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,000
We're counting on you Roronoa-san and the other guy!

252
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,090
Leave it to us!

253
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,550
Get in there!

254
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,060
Target; Scrap Island!

255
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,520
What're you trying to do?!

256
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,620
The Franky Family special product!

257
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,810
The Shoot Anything Cannon!

258
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,950
Hey, hey you!

259
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,490
Stop joking aroun...!

260
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,960
Instead of his pants, he went there first!

261
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,660
Grab on, Chopper!

262
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,670
Rubber...

263
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,880
Rocket!

264
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,540
That's something accursed!

265
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,840
Idiot! It's just the pervert!

266
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,760


267
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,290
B-Brother!

268
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,680
What's with this situation?!

269
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,800
Franky!

270
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,480
Thanks for the ship!

271
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
It's the best ship!

272
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,740
We'll treasure it!

273
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,180
Yeah!

274
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,200
I pray for you to have a safe trip.

275
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,870
If you want these pants back,

276
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,830
You'll have to become our crewmate!

277
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,650
Put on your pants!

278
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,520
Pervert!

279
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,030
He destroyed the city again!

280
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,650
Get out of here, pervert!

281
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,490
You idiot!

282
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,030
Give back my pants, Straw Hat.

283
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,790
Then, join our crew.

284
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't be stupid!

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,420
Don't think just because you got my pants, you can make me your crewmate!

286
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:55,570
What

287
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:55,570
kind

288
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,570
of

289
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:55,570
man

290
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,570
is

291
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,570
that

292
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,570
who,

293
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,570
even

294
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,570
naked

295
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,570
faces

296
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,570
straight

297
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,570
the

298
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,570
countless

299
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,570
waves

300
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,570
as

301
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,570
it

302
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,570
would

303
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,570
be

304
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,570
a

305
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,570
lion

306
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,140
He decided to pose with his lower half exposed!

307
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,770
Don't look!

308
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,970
It's the worst!

309
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,240
He's the worst!

310
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,880
I took him lightly!

311
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,180
How determinated!

312
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,150
He's a man inside a man!

313
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,240
He's just a pervert!

314
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,850
If I might get a little rough...

315
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,200
Can I give a hand?

316
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,170
Dos Fleur!

317
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,170
{\an8}Two Flowers

318
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,280
Grab!

319
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,060
Eh?! Wait a sec, Robin!

320
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,910
They have been grabbed! Ouch!

321
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,910
They'll be smashed, Robin!

322
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,840
They'll be torn off!

323
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,210
They'll be taken off!

324
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,670
Just like an orange!

325
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,930
Hey, Robin!

326
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,430
I want him to be still a man when he becomes our crewmate!

327
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,830
Don't take them!

328
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,590
It hurts just by looking!

329
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,610
What's going on?

330
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,480
Franky is taking damage!

331
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,730
What? It's like a scream when a chicken's head is being tied up!

332
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,720
I feel bad for him.

333
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,900
Even though he's a pervert.

334
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,120
Just like when a treasure is in front of a pirate and he doesn't want to let go.

335
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,710
If I don't receive a good reason,

336
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm not letting you go.

337
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,740
T-That's why...!

338
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,940
I told you I can't leave this island...

339
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm grateful to you guys...

340
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,530
But that's something impossible for me to do.

341
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,700
I want to go with you but...

342
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,640
There are still things I must do here.

343
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,280
That's why I gave you the ship.

344
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,570
I quit being a shipwright to begin with.

345
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,220
That's why, that one is the only ship I'll ever build again.

346
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,270
I had only one wish...

347
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,570
And that is.. the dream ship over there!

348
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,520
Wait, Franky...

349
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,370
That still hasn't become the dream ship you talked about.

350
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,650
Dream ship?

351
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,670
That's right!

352
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,090
That ship won't be one that will be completed just with the blueprints.

353
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,700
It'll sail many seas!

354
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,050
Overcome many battles and difficulties...

355
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,650
And when it reaches the end of the sea...

356
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,270
That's when it'll be called a dream ship!

357
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,570
Then, someday, when I complete that awesome ship,

358
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll board it and become its shipwright!

359
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm looking forward to see that fateful day!

360
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,010
By then the ship might be all worn out but,

361
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,500
Surely, it'll shine much more than any other ship out there!

362
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,180
How is it? Amazing, isn't it, Tom-san?

363
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,880
Yes, it's amazing.

364
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,350
And if you get on it and take care of it...

365
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,660
You will have surpassed me!

366
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,960
It's that pirate blood of yours.

367
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,510
Dumb-Franky, do you really think you can surpass Tom-san?

368
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,310
What was that?!

369
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,870
Bastard! What're you doing?!

370
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,450
Damn Dumb-Franky!

371
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,710
What, if you're a man do it with a bang!

372
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,270
The things I wanted to do have changed!

373
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,730
The things you wanted?

374
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,060
You're wrong.

375
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,210
You now, have done everything you had to do in this island.

376
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,410
Atonement!

377
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,870
That day...

378
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,880
You blamed yourself and regretted the capture of Tom-san.

379
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,810
But Tom-san has already forgiven you.

380
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,900
Showing you a new path.

381
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,600
You collected thugs from the backstreets,

382
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,580
Made a name for yourselves as bounty hunters,

383
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,780
Protected this island from plunderers,

384
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,550
You protected everything Tom-san loved in this Water Metropolis,

385
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,490
Everything to atone for your guilt.

386
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,210
You might not see it from that point of view.

387
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,940
Of course I don't...

388
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,870
I didn't intend that in the least.

389
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,900
You stopped making those ships you liked, to keep living.

390
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,930
Do you plan to keep doing that from here on?

391
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,050
Even though Tom-san has already forgiven you,

392
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,160
Even though I have already forgiven you,

393
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,030
It won't change anything, right?

394
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,640
It's time...

395
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,660
To forgive yourself, Franky!

396
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,790
Live for your dream now!

397
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,550
What...?!

398
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,560
A bag?

399
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,220
It's the luggage for your trip, Brother!

400
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,280
Move it, you!

401
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,310
Ah! The Franky Family!

402
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,620
Brother!

403
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,490
Brother!

404
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,950
Those guys...!

405
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,670
Brother, please forgive us for everything!

406
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,040
We're really sorry!

407
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,730
Really sorry!

408
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,230
We're prepared to take any punishment.

409
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,010
We're idiots, so...!

410
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,630
This was all we could plan!

411
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,650
What were you planning?!

412
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,030
A way to steal my pants?!

413
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,800
A way to turn me into a pirate?!

414
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,610
Don't butt in!

415
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,080
This is my life!

416
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,560
I'll decide everything!

417
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,620
Does the way you, my followers, are making me walk delight you?!

418
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,230
It's shameful!

419
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,050
If you thought this through,

420
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,930
You shouldn't have in the first place!

421
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,670
There's no excuse but...

422
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,390
Is it bad if we care for you a little?

423
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,430
For the one who picked us up when were just plunderers...

424
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,030
Is it bad if we care for your happiness?!

425
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,360
Who's the idiot?

426
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,640
You guys...

427
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,490
B-Brother...

428
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,520
Hey! Robin!

429
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,680
Please don't overdo it! I beg of you!

430
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,230
He'll turn into a woman!

431
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,700
He's crying!

432
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,440
Damn it, Nico Robin!

433
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,080
I won't forgive you!

434
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,320
It hurts so much that I can't stop crying!

435
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,200
Robin!

436
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,590
Have you stopped?

437
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,140
All I did, was just start this.

438
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,690
He sure is clever.

439
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,060
Blaming the pain for those tears.

440
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,570
Just start it?

441
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,610
Damn!

442
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,870
I can't stop crying!

443
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,890
Brother!

444
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,130
Are you okay?!

445
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,550
There's no way I could be okay!

446
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,040
It seems you haven't noticed...

447
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,970
What's with this speedo guy?

448
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,260
You shouldn't show up in these backstreets.

449
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,730
Zambai!

450
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:22,640
This time, the backstreets of Water Seven will be controlled by Franky!

451
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,690
It's a pleasure!

452
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,650
Y-Yes!

453
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,300
Brother!

454
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,120
Ah! This is good!

455
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,170
We should come again.

456
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,550
It's a bro who goes outside in a speedo.

457
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,130
Would you like to have a drink with us?

458
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,840
We'll show you the way to the bar.

459
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,100
W-What're you doing?!

460
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,370
Let go of us!

461
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,480
Little girls shouldn't drink sake during daytime!

462
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,740
I happen to know a nice store where we can drink some good cola.

463
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,160
How about it?

464
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,450
Would you like to?

465
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,400
Brother! Brother!

466
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,330
Food... please...

467
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,840
All the guys who haven't eaten, follow me!

468
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,280
Rampage all you want!

469
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,720
It's the raising of the Franky Family!

470
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:55,110
Franky! Franky! Franky!

471
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,830
You...

472
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,690
If I'm not here, how can you survive...?

473
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,080
Brother...

474
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,760
We'll test our strength with new tasks in Water Seven...!

475
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,130
And show we can definitely succeed!

476
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,470
Please be at ease!

477
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,730
Brother, don't cry!

478
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,100
Brother!

479
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,920
Even if Brother goes far away...

480
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,490
We will always be your followers!

481
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,060
Brother!

482
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,550
I can't stop crying...!

483
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,140
Hurry!

484
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,370
This is bad!

485
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,870
Luffy!

486
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,810
Zoro, Sanji.

487
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,790
We're in big trouble!

488
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,310
Your grandpa came back, Luffy!

489
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,510
He's at the opposite coast making arrangements to attack and is looking for us!

490
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,400
Huh?! Why?!

491
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,470
Didn't he decide not to capture us?!

492
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,570
How should we know?!

493
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,350
Hurry up and prepare to leave!

494
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,390
Franky! Bastard, you're not wearing your pants yet?!

495
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,210
Here you go!

496
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,980
Well then, get on, Franky.

497
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,530
On my ship.

498
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,480
Stop talking so cocky!

499
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,760
The only repairs you amateurs are capable of, are cheap ones.

500
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,850
If there isn't one shipwright in this splendid ship...

501
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,410
I would pity the ship.

502
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,810
It can't be helped.

503
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,370
I'll give you a hand!

504
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,650
Your ship's shipwright...

505
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,090
Will be the great Franky!

506
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,550
Alright! A new crewmate!

507
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,100
Alright!

508
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Brother!

509
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,980
Don't cry...!

510
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,330
Don't cry!

511
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,270
Straw Hat-san is a man of trust!

512
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,940
Tom-san...

513
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,670
I'm... leaving this island...

514
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,810
I was nothing but a troublesome student, however...

515
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,560
Did you hear, the news from scrap island?!

516
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,110
Tom's Workers finished the sea train, you say?!

517
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,740
Thank you for looking after me!

518
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,060
Galley-La head shipwrights.

519
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,020
Iceburg, I'm counting on you!

520
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,990
You were also a troublesome student...

521
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,620
Old lady Kokoro...

522
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,950
Little ones...

523
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,460
Yokozuna...

524
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,710
Pervert!

525
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,650
Lively townspeople...

526
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,240
Where are you going?!

527
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,410
You'll come back, right?!

528
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,280
My little sisters...

529
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,820
Sodom.

530
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,840
Gomorrah.

531
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,780
And...

532
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,800
My beloved followers!

533
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,080
I'll be leaving for a while!

534
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,300
Put on your pants.
