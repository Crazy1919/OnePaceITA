We're fallen angels,

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,430
we'll fire arrows into your dreams.

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,610
What color shall we add

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,450
into the cobalt blue?

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,550
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes.

Let's raise our wings, full of warmth.

Please make sure you have all your belongings.

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,500
Forget the money. Just take it with you!

30
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,090
This sucks...

31
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,760
But man... this year's Aqua Laguna was powerful.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,960
It doesn't seem like we'll be able to repair this ourselves...

33
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,090
T-That's...

34
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,960
Paulie from Dock 1.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,410
What's he doing here in the back streets?

36
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,910
Paulie-san!

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,490
Move! Get outta here, you're in the way!

38
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,490
I'll leave this area to you, Dock 3.

39
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,690
Alright!

40
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,810
Dock 5, you take the area starting from the house next to the old rail line.

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,680
Yeah!

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,460
We still have our jobs to do, so I want this town fully repaired in one month!

43
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,230
Yeah!

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,690
At any rate!

45
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,910
Got it!

46
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,780
Amazing! They're so dependable.

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,030
That's the Galley-La Company for you!

48
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,050
North Coast: Franky House Ruins.

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,730
Whew... rebuilding just seems harder and harder.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,810
Cause we're used to breaking things down right?

51
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,340
Camping again huh?

52
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,660
All right.

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,300
Sodom, and you too Gomorah,

54
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,290
You guys rest up for now.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,710
The Reindeer said that Gomorah's eyesight should return if he lets them rest.

56
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,510
Really? That's great.

57
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,480
The Shipyard: Dock 1.

58
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,870
{\an8}Let us meet the Pirates!

59
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,480
{\an8}We want to apologize for accusing them of the assassination!

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,160
No way, the Pirates aren't meeting anyone.

61
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,580
At least let us thank whoever it was who saved Iceberg-san's life!

62
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,080
Water 7 News! Can we get a comment from the heroes who saved the mayor?

63
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,300
Give it up, it's impossible right now.

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,500
Then a picture at least!

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,490
I told you no!

66
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,130
If you need a replacement secretary for Kalifa, let me do it!

67
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,390
I'll help with anything!

68
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,600
Amazing! What inhuman strength!

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,330
Is this alright?

70
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,820
Yeah, thank you!

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,830
What else would you expect from a giant?!

72
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,000
If it's stuff like this then ask us anytime!

73
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,330
Oh yea, Sniper King?

74
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,050
Are you alright here?

75
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,280
If our bosses' fight isn't over, then there's no way we can go to that island.

76
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,700
We'll help this island out a bit, and then take our time and return to Elbaf.

77
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,070
If you want to, we'll take you along with us.

78
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,030
I...

79
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,580
Galley-La Company's Main Office.
The Remains of Iceberg's House.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,210
Temporary Headquarters.

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,210
{\an8}I see, so you burned the blueprints...

82
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,730
It's for the best.

83
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,680
You've gained the World Government's resentment as well.

84
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,940
Yeah, I guess.

85
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,570
So, what have you been drawing all this time?

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,710
This time when Aqua Laguna came...

87
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,090
The ground was quaking with anxiety...

88
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,380
That the day when this entire island will be swallowed into the sea is nearby.

89
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,500
So, what'll you do?

90
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,020
I'm going to make this island float on the sea.

91
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,140
What!? Make Water Seven... a ship?!

92
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,260
C-Can that even be done?!

93
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,690
Did you forget?

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,680
The back of the man who could make the impossible possible.

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,400
We were always watching him.

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,360
If you're a man...

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,750
Do it with a "Don".

98
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,330
That's how he was.

99
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,450
Hello?

100
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,110
Oh, is that you, Brother?

101
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,390
Let me tell you. It finally came. We're where it arrived off the sea train.

102
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,650
Your 200 million beli item.

103
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,110
It's finally here...

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,640
Temporary Headquarters.
Special Pirates' Room,
Including Kitchen, Bath and Toilet.

105
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm comin' in guys.

106
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,870
Granny Kokoro!

107
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,460
Yo, comin' in!

108
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,650
And you guys too.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,640
You, just wait outside.

110
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,600
It seems you all finally woke up.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,990
To sleep for two days, you must have been really worn out.

112
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,100
I guess that's expected.

113
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,860
Oh, the Pirate King sure seems to be feeling good.

114
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,370
Oh? You're mistaken.

115
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,870
About what?

116
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,490
After the fight he collapsed, but he was still dying to eat.

117
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,640
He seems to have invented a technique to eat while sleeping.

118
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,340
He's sleeping?!

119
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,850
Amazing, Pirate bro!

120
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,060
He's a pretty skilled guy.

121
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,860
Oh yea, the Log Pose should be set again after 2 or 3 days!

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,870
What happened here?!

123
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,000
Even if the Log is set, we can't move forward anymore...

124
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,760
The 100 Million beli we worked so hard for to buy us a new ship...

125
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,230
Our clothes... our furniture... Bellemere-san's orange trees... all of it...

126
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,730
Aqua Laguna carried it all away...

127
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,650
We can't go anywhere anymore...

128
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,590
We left all of it at the inn in the back streets.

129
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,780
Oh, so that's what the visitors out front are for.

130
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,040
Visitors?

131
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,260
My Orange Trees!

132
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,840
I thought they'd never come back!

133
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Thank goodness!

134
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,370
Actually, while we thought you were responsible for Iceburg's assassination,

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,590
Thank goodness!

136
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,890
Your stuff crossed our minds, so we seized it all.

137
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,510
Sorry about that.

138
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,480
It's alright! Thank you!

139
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,980
Well, that's good.

140
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,300
Hey, we're coming in.

141
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,180
We're back.

142
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,200
Oh, Chopper.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,530
And Robin-chwan~!

144
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,060
That was heavy wasn't it? Now please, right this way...

145
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,870
Thank you.

146
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,700
I went and checked on the Franky Family's wounds,

147
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,330
and I didn't let Robin out of my sight!

148
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,820
Good work!

149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,170
I already told you I'm not going anywhere.

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,850
You promise?

151
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,190
I promise.

152
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,120
Look you two, my orange trees were okay.

153
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
All our money and stuff is back!

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,260
Really?

155
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,020
Now we can continue our voyage!

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,280
Yay! That's great!

157
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,100
Feeling super you guys?! Everybody...

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Not everybody is around... Well, whatever...

159
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,200
Franky, what are you up to all of a sudden?

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,980
Listen!

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,180
I have something important to tell you.

162
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,150
There's an island, constantly at war...

163
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,980
What's this out of nowhere?

164
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,610
You just come in and start talking, if it's not an apology then we're not listening.

165
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,850
Shut up! Be quiet and listen.

166
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,680
Since the war started, if a person were to try living on that island under that rain of shells.

167
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,630
The people would die, the town would die. They'd be cremated with their ruins.

168
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,100
There was something still standing, a sturdy tree.

169
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,890
No matter what happened, it wouldn't fall.

170
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,620
People gathered near the tree and built a city... and a country.

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,070
There are only a few in the world.

172
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,790
The name of that strongest tree is...

173
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,990
The Treasure Wood Adam.

174
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,960
A tree?

175
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,840
A tree? What about it?

176
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,430
In our routes, having even a piece of that tree show up is extremely rare.

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,400
I wanted it but...

178
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
It's an item that costs 200 million.

179
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,280
I couldn't get my hands on it.

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,080
And what appeared before me but a group of pirates carrying a ton of money, you guys.

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,710
Why you! You used our money to buy something like that, didn't you?!

182
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,380
Just let me finish!

183
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,940
A long time ago, I decided I would never build a ship again.

184
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,860
But before long, to catch up to a man I admired, and to reach my own goal,

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,490
I drew up the blueprints for a ship...

186
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,090
My dream is to use that treasure wood and just one last time...

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,030
Make a ship, able to sail any sea. I'm going to make a Dream Ship.

188
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,700
I already have the wood, and the blueprints. With this I can make it.

189
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,120
So, when it's done...

190
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,920
Would you all sail in the ship I created?!

191
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,820
Then...?

192
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,690
So, you mean you'll give us that ship!?

193
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,270
Yeah.

194
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,090
If people who I like are sailing it.

195
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,810
That's what will make me happiest.

196
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,580
It's something I was only able to make because of your "investment" after all.

197
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:25,670
The only ship that ever sailed around the world,
Gold Roger's Oro Jackson, was made from this wood.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,620
I'll definitely...

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,470
Show you an amazing ship.

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,740
Can't be helped, you and Tom-san are the same after all.

201
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,100
Just like a carpenter...

202
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,700
That's true, now...

203
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:54,620
Now I can understand how Tom-san felt when he died with his pride.

204
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,830
You're really a good guy! We'll take it! Thank you Franky!

205
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,360
Onto the next island!

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,610
This is great! Luffy! We've got a ship!

207
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,630
This is bad, we were found out this quickly, and Luffy's still sleeping!

208
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,340
I have to let them know fast!

209
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,510
What?!

210
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,220
It's them... they're here to capture the pirates.

211
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Even though they're the heroes who saved Iceburg's life.

212
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,900
Hey, look over there!

213
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,150
That's Vice-Admiral Garp's warship from Headquarters.

214
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,170
Did you say Garp?

215
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,590
Isn't he the legendary marine who cornered Gold Roger countless times?

216
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,580
Why is such an amazing marine...

217
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,680
This is bad for the pirates.

218
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,860
The... sea?

219
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,730
Crap, was it the other direction?

220
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,060
W-Wait a second officers. There's no one but our president back-

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,150
Stop blathering! There should be pirates back here.

222
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,480
We said there aren't!

223
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,730
W-Wait you can't!

224
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,800
Wait, over there the Straw Ha-

225
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,980
Idiot!

226
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,570
You two, wait here.

227
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,250
Yessir!

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,710
What the...?

229
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,260
Who is it?

230
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,280
Are you the Straw Hat Pirates?

231
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,240
There're some men here who want to meet Monkey D. Luffy.

232
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,200
The Navy?!

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,880
Wake up!

234
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,350
Luffy!

235
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,100
It hurts! It hurts!

236
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,110
"It hurts"? What are you saying? That was a punch. For it to hurt a rubber man-

237
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,240
There's no defense against a fist of love.

238
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,830
I heard you've been acting pretty recklessly...

239
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,750
Luffy.

240
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,330
G- G- G-

241
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,230
Grandpa?!

242
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,640
Now Luffy,

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,730
Don't you think you owe me an apology?

244
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,730
Marine HQ Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
"Garp The Fist"

245
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,740
Garp... isn't that the name of that marine hero!?

246
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,250
Luffy, is your grandpa really...?

247
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,330
He is, don't try fighting him.

248
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,290
I was almost killed by grandpa tons of times in the past.

249
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,060
Come on now, don't start speaking ill of me.

250
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,450
When I tossed you into that bottomless ravine,

251
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,540
And left you alone in the jungle at night,

252
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,830
And tied you to balloons and sent you flying into the sky,

253
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,980
All of it was to make you into a strong man!

254
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,320
I think I've just seen part of what gave Luffy his endless will to live...

255
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,790
In the end I left you with a close friend to continue your training with Ace.

256
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,560
And while you were out of my sight this has happened...

257
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,400
I did all that to forge you into a strong marine!!!

258
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,650
I always told you that I wanted to be a pirate didn't I!?

259
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,450
You were corrupted by that "Red Hair"!

260
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,030
It's nonsense!

261
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,480
I- I owe my life to Shanks!

262
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,880
Don't insult him!

263
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,930
Do you mean to tell your own Grandpa what to do?!

264
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,790
I'm sorry!

265
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,470
Emergency! Luffy was caught by the Navy!

266
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,310
Luffy!

267
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,230
This is bad, if we try to fight they'll jump right on top of us!

268
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,190
They fell asleep?!

269
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,750
So, what do we do now?

270
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,910
I've never been in a situation like this!

271
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,210
Uh oh, I fell asleep...

272
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,220
Wake up Luffy!

273
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,440
Is that how you act towards someone scolding you?!

274
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,490
First of all, where do you get off speaking like that to your grandpa?!

275
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,330
Oh whatever, just do what you want...

276
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,610
So Luffy's Grandpa is a Headquarters Marine?!

277
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,550
This is getting crazy.

278
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,140
I-I-It huuuuurts...

279
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,410
Do you even know what level of Pirate that "Red Hair" you keep going on about is!?

280
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,630
Shanks? And the guys?

281
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,660
Are Shanks and everybody doing alright? Where are they!?

282
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,370
Whether they're fine or not...

283
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,730
With as many pirates out there now as there are stars,

284
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,140
Like Whitebeard, he is one of the four great pirates!

285
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,240
Those who rule over the latter half of the Grand Line as if they were emperors.

286
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,290
We call them the Four Emperors!

287
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:20,210
In order to reign in these four men, Marine HQ and the Seven Warlords of the Sea were assembled.

288
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,920
These three great powers form a delicate balance that keeps peace around the world from crumbling.

289
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,780
I don't really get it, but if he's fine then okay.

290
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,010
Man, this brings back memories...

291
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,710
What is his connection with Red Hair?

292
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,790
Luffy said that he asked him to take care of that straw hat for him.

293
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,790
I didn't know he was such an amazing person.

294
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,140
It's over here, Zoro-san!

295
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,380
Damn, the marines are already here!

296
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,850
Please go on ahead.

297
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,770
We're really...

298
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,390
We're really sorry we tried to mug you!

299
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,230
Don't worry about it. Thanks for showing me the way.

300
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,850
Later.

301
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,580
Oh? What is going on?

302
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,730
It's the bounty head, the pirate hunter Zoro.

303
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,890
Oh? Luffy's crewmate right?

304
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,050
He seems to be pretty tough.

305
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,060
Heh, you two, try and stop him!

306
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,310
Yessir!

307
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,870
Kukuri knives huh? You're using something pretty unusual.

308
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,920
Oh, Zoro wait! There's no reason to fi-

309
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,370
What the...! Why you!

310
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,130
Shave!

311
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,680
That technique...

312
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,190
Sergeant Major!

313
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,030
Sergeant!

314
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,790
Really, you're no match at all.

315
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,550
You're as strong as I thought. Just what I'd expect.

316
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,960
I've lost.

317
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,010
Luffy-san, Zoro-san.

318
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,710
It's been a while.

319
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,970
Do you know who I am?

320
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,430
Who?

321
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,900
It's me, Coby!

322
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,410
Don't you remember?

323
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,700
Coby?

324
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,050
Coby?!

325
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,590
Coby is my friend but... but the Coby I knew was a lot smaller.

326
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,790
I'm that Coby!

327
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,100
That same cry-baby good-for-nothing Coby.

328
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,560
Are you serious?!

329
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,110
That Coby... why is he on the Grand Line?

330
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,710
I'm still not used to being a commissioned officer but,

331
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,990
When I heard the two of you were nearby, I couldn't resist coming to see you.

332
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,470
{\an8}It's because of you two that we've become who we are!

333
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,470
Marine HQ Sergeant Major
Coby

334
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,510
Marine HQ Sergeant
Helmeppo

335
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,510
Well, I'll give you that much.

336
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,370
A lot has happened... right now we're being trained by Vice Admiral Garp at headquarters.

337
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,030
So that's what happened?

338
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,150
But man, there's a limit to how fast you should grow up, you surprised me.

339
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,990
You were a bit rounder back then too.

340
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,500
You must be pretty tired after the incident, sorry to disturb you.

341
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,260
It's fine. It's been a while, so let's make it a party!

342
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,630
Wait a second! You guys!

343
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,100
You didn't recognize me at all did you?!

344
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,220
Who're you?

345
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,990
It's me! M-E!

346
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,520
No idea, who are you?

347
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,300
The answer is...

348
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,070
Helmeppo.

349
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,880
Captain Morgan's son, Helmeppo.

350
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,140
I'm the man who almost drove you to the death penalty, Roronoa Zoro!

351
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,150
Really now, stop joking around.

352
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,150
We can't have you bullying people now.

353
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,410
You seem cheerful for a corpse, Roronoa Zoro.

354
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,110
Stop!

355
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm that idiot who rode on his father's fame!

356
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,630
Oh? That was you?

357
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,540
Hey!

358
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,220
Oh yeah, there was a guy like that... that was you?

359
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,360
I knew it... I still can't forgive these guys, Coby!

360
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,190
It can't be avoided Helmeppo-san, you can't dodge your past.

361
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,040
That was it?

362
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,120
That was it.

363
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,490
Now then, you guys.

364
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,160
Sir!

365
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,130
Fix this wall.

366
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,340
But you did that yourself...

367
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,840
If you want us to fix it, then why did you even break it?

368
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,410
Entering that way is cooler.

369
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,100
Please don't break things for a reason like that!

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,140
Fine, if you want us to fix it, then you need to help too.

371
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,850
Alright.

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,490
Your grandpa is pretty famous isn't he?

373
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,450
I guess, I don't know much about what he does though.

374
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,880
By the way Luffy, I heard you met your old man.

375
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,630
Huh? Dad?

376
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,550
What do you mean by dad?

377
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,560
Do I have a dad?

378
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,160
What's that? So he didn't introduce himself then?

379
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,860
I heard he saw you off at Loguetown!

380
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,300
Luffy's father was in that town?

381
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,580
What is my dad like?

382
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,850
I wonder what Luffy's father is like...

383
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,320
The name of your father is...

384
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,510
Monkey D. Dragon.

385
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,720
He's a revolutionary.

386
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,090
Dragon?

387
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,260
The revolutionary Dragon had a son!?

388
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,890
Luffy-san is that Dragon's kid...

389
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,000
That means... that Dragon is Vice-Admiral Garp's kid...

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,500
What the hell is up with this family?

391
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,680
This is the first time I've heard Dragon's full name!

392
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,430
Hey guys, why is everyone so...

393
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Idiot! You don't know who Dragon is!?

394
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,310
Your father is a completely outrageous man!

395
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,400
Hey, Robin...

396
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,160
How should I explain this...

397
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,040
Pirates wouldn't usually try by themselves to disrupt the government or marines...

398
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,000
But there is currently a power that is trying to directly oppose the World Government.

399
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,600
That would be the Revolutionary Army. And the man at it's center would be Dragon.

400
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,060
Right now throughout the world this ideology is being spread.

401
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,960
Encouraging countries to overthrow their monarchies.

402
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,940
Countless countries have already fallen.

403
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,160
As expected, the World Government was upset,

404
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,790
And has labeled the puppet master Dragon the most dangerous criminal in the world,

405
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,920
They have been constantly pursuing him but...

406
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,380
They couldn't find even a trace of where he had come from.

407
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,760
He was a mysterious man...

408
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,720
And yet...

409
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,390
And yet...?

410
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,020
I probably shouldn't have said all that.

411
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,530
So...

412
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,160
Forget all that!
