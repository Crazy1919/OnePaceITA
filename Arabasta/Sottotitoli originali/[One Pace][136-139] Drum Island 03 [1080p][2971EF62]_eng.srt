Begin the operation.

2658
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,220
Scalpel!

2659
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,800
Needle!

2660
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,760
Tin.

2661
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,680
Hammer.

2662
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,970
Wow... I really thought I'd die!

2663
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,230
{Just like what happened now, -OG}Exactly my point!{Z}

bereft of doctors... Wapol!{Z}

2666

{Wapol? It's Wapol-sama,
my retainer Dalton. -OG}Wapol? That's King Wapol to you,
Dalton, my retainer.{Evo, from notes}

2667
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,410
{He's right! You don't
have right to blather!}Hear, hear!
You don't have the right to blather!{Evo, from notes}

2668
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,410
{The three of us, you included,
were Wapol-sama's top brass. -OG}The three of us, you included,
were King Wapol's top brass.{Evo, from notes}

We were his loyal hands, remember?

2670
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,040
It is true that when you
were making people suffer,

2671
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,340
{all I could do was just watch -OG}all I could do was watch,
{Evo, from notes}{even though I was by your
side as one of your to brass. -OG}even though I was right there, by you.{Evo}

2672
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,090
I have to take responsibility for that.

2673
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,470
Wapol...
let us leave this country together.

2674
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,260
{We must not stay in this land any longer. -OG}We must not stay
in this land any longer.{Evo, from notes}

2675
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,520
Dalton-san!
You didn't do anything wrong!

2676
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
That's right!

2677
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,020
You're the only one in the government
who fought for the citizens!

2678
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,280
{Even when it almost killed you! -OG}Even at your own risk!{Evo}

2679
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,740
Humph! You should've died
as Drum's captain of the Royal Guard!

2680
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,200
{I'm surprised that you survived in
this country without any doctors. -OG}I'm surprised that you survived
in this country with no doctors.{Evo}

2681
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,330
Drum is acknowledged internationally
as a country with advanced medicine.

2682
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,460
But who would know...
that there were actually

2683
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,210
only twenty doctors who worked
in the research facility of the king's castle,

2684
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,180
and all the other doctors were exiled?

2685
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,640
That's right! Those who become
sick can beg for their lives.

2686
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,100
If I feel like it,
I might lend them the Issie 20.

2687
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,110
If they don't wanna die,
all they have to do is obey me, the king!

2688
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,070
With that, my rule is absolute.
That's the government of this country!

2689
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,820
{You can't call that a government! -OG}You cannot call that a government!{Evo}

2690
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,160
Humph! You sure speak
your mind, don't you?

2691
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,210
Kill him! Kill your ex-captain!

2692
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,710
As I figured,
you do not get what I'm saying...

2693
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,340
{You're the son of the previous
king who was good to me. -OG}{You're the son of the previous

2694
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,260
I was hoping that you would
come to your senses some day,

2695
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,890
{but it seems like that
was wishful thinking! -OG}{but it seems not!-Evo}but it seems I was deluding myself!{Evo, from notes}

2698
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,690
Don't flinch! Fire!

2699
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,560
We can't hit him!

2700
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
He's dodging them!

2701
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,780
{I'll show no mercy even though
you're my ex-subordinates! -OG}I'll show no mercy,
even to my ex-subordinates!{Evo}

2702
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,580

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,250
{He's strong! How powerful! -OG}Incredible! What power...!{Evo, from notes}

{I've had enough with you all. - OG}I have had it up to here with you all!{Z}

2706
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,100
A country where the king
is the first to run off

2707

{when the country is in crisis
should just die out! -OG}during a time of crisis

fighting against the two of us.{Evo, from notes}

2709
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,890
Just give up.

2710
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,360
Dalton-san!

2711
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,870
Dalton-san!

2712
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,360
We've come to assist you!

{That's unfortunate for you. -OG}{How unfortunate for you.}{Evo, from notes}to your ultimate misfortune.

Don't...!

2718
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,380
Your weak point is...

2719
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,140
– Why...
– ...did you shield us...?

2720
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,060

An earthquake?

Huh?

2729
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,640

Twenty-five thousand
six hundred thirty-four!

2737

Ahhh! Those damn bunnies!
They'll never get away with this! Dammit!

How should I know?!

2740
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,010
The first priority is Nami-san!

Oh no! We're not high enough!

2755

What do I do now?!

2756
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,810
Oh, yeah!

2757
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,490
Sanji! Grab my hand!

2758
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,160
You saved my skin!

2759
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,740
Yeah, but...

2760
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,700
even though we won't sink in the snow,

2761
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,290
we'll go straight down the mountain
if we don't do anything!

2762
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,500
What?!

2763
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,420
Hell no! We've come
all this way and were almost

2764
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,840
at the foot of that chimney mountain!

2765
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,970

What're we gonna do, Sanji?!

There's only one way!

Even if we get swallowed,
I'll save you for sure!

2798
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,910
Hey, do you think
Luffy-san and the others...

2799
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,880
Could they have been swallowed
by this avalanche?{Evo: I considered restructuring a bit for CPS' sake by making this "...could have been swallowed..." as if it follows up from last line more directly. But that's not how Vivi says it so I'm leaving as-is with 16 CPS for now.}

Hang in there just a little longer.

2806
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,790
{Listen. Hold this. Stay here
and wait for me a little longer. -OG}Listen. Hold this. Stay here
and wait for me just a little while.{Evo}

2807
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,950
Oh, it was you guys.

2808
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,780
{No wonder I thought
it was an awful syrup. - OG}No wonder the taste
was like a gross syrup.{Z}

2809
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,740
They'll never get away with this!

2810
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,990
{Who are you talking about? -OG}Who do you mean?{Evo}

2811
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,790
{Idiot! Of course them! -OG}Idiot! Them of course!{Evo, from notes}

2812
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,460
{Them meaning...? -OG}"Them" meaning...?{Evo}

2813
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,210
You said some of the Straw Hats
are going up the mountain

2814
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,170
{to the castle right now...
then this is what happened! -OG}to the castle right now...
then this happened!{Evo}

2815
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,510
{They have a huge grudge against
us over what happened between us, -OG}They have a grudge against us
because of what happened,{Evo}

2816
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,470
so they caused an avalanche
on that snow mountain.

2817
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh no! That's what happened?

2818
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,560
Then, this avalanche was their doing...

2819
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,020
{Let's go! We'll follow
them on the snow mountain! -OG}Let's go! We'll follow them
to the snow mountain!{Evo}

2820
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,650
I'll teach them a lesson
about battling in the snow!

2821
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,680
I will definitely get you there.

2822
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,050
Don't die...

2823
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,600
both of you...

2824
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
There they are!

2825
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,020
{Please look at that, Wapolsama!
We found them! -OG}Please look at that, King Wapol!
We found them!{Evo, from notes}

2826
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,490
Hold it, brat!

2827
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,240
{How dare you do
many rude things to me! -OG}It's unthinkable
how impertinent you've been!{Evo, from notes}

2828
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,200
{I'll beat you up! -OG}You'll pay for that!{Evo, from notes}

2829
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,750
{Get out of my way. -OG}Move.{Evo, from notes}

2830
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,750
Humph! You hippo!

2831
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,710
{Why would I get out of your way?! -OG}Why should I move?{Evo, from notes}

2832
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,630
Looks like what you have on your back
and {in}under your arm are half-dead.

2833
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,270
Hold it!

2834
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,440
Oh, I know!

2835
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,310
Chess! I thought up a new law.

2836
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,650
Write this down.

2837
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,650
{Yes, sir! - OG}Yes, Sire!{Z}

2838
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,440
Those who ignore the king
are to be executed!

2839
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,660
Ignoring me already?!

2840
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,830
{q2Guys! First, get the sick and injured ones,
who are ignoring me the most! -OG}Guys! Get the sick and injured ones first!
They're ignoring me the most!{Evo, from notes}

2841
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,750
{– Yes sir!
– Yes sir! - OG}– Sire!
– Sire!{Z}

2842
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,250
What'd you say?!

2843
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,380
I'll take the woman on his back!

2844
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,090
I'll take the man.

2845
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,050
Take this! Marimo's Surprise!

2846
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Listen, Luffy!

2847
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,220
{Don't you dare fight. -OG}Don't you dare fight them.{Evo, to match Drum 02 according to Zenef's note}

2848
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,140
Whether you attack or get struck,

2849
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,310
{Nami-\i0san\i1 will feel the whole impact too! -OG}Nami-san will
feel the whole impact too!{Evo, to match Drum 02 according to Zenef's note}

2850
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,320
Damn you!

2851
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
You'll regret this!

2852
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,160
Don't follow me!

2853
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,040
Humph. What a coward... It's no use!

2854
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,170
I'll show him...

2855
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,170
what a battle in the snow is like...

2856
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,020
Huh...? They're gone...

2857
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,980
What's going on?
I wonder if they've already given up...

2858
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,530
{Now this is a true battle
in a snowy area! -OG}Now this is a true snow battle!{Evo}

2859
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,110
The white disguise!
Snow Powder Makeup!

2860
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,780
They're so weak,
they'll be dead with just one shot.

2861
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,660
Checkmate!

2862
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,750
Stop it!

2863
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,050
Polar bears...

2864
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,350
Lapins?!

2865
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,770
Did they protect him?

2866
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,650
It's a coincidence. Lapins never
become attached to humans.

2867
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,330
Thanks! You saved me!

2868
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,750
Don't let him get away!

2869
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,620
{Yes, sir! - OG}– Yes, Majesty!
– Yes, Majesty!{Z}

2870
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,850
What the hell do they
think they're doing?!

2871
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,490
Doctor...

2872
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,200
Doctor...

2873
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,210
Doctor...

2874
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,720
So this is it...

2875
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,850
I can't see the top.

2876
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,650
I can find the doctor... up there...

2877
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,780
Hang in there a little longer...
Nami! Sanji!

2878
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,830
Avalanche...

2879
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,920
{We were swallowed by the avalanche... -OG}We were swallowed by the avalanche...{Evo, from notes}

2880
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,800
Ah! U... Usopp-san?!

2881
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,920
Usopp-san!

2882
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,800
Usopp-san! Come on! Wake up!

2883
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,140
He's still alive!

2884
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,640
Usopp-san! Hang on!

2885
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,860
Come on! Usopp-san!

2886
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,400
Usopp-san!

2887
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,780
{Oh Vivi... Don't wake me up. -OG}Oh, Vivi... Don't wake me up.{Evo}

2888
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,990
I was just having a beautiful dream.

2889
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,830
A field of beautiful flowers out of this world
and a beautiful river... Oh?

2890
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,910
You're almost in the afterlife!

2891
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,910
Isn't that Zoro swimming in the river...?

2892
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,790
Wake up! Don't sleep! Wake up!

2893
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,790
Isn't that Zoro swimming in the river...?

2894
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,800
All 74,000 Usopp Pirates, close in!

2895
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,890
No! Wake up! Usopp-san,
don't die! Usopp-san!

2896
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,430
Usopp-san! Usopp-san! Usopp-san!
Usopp-san! Usopp-san! Usopp-san!

2897
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,390
Phew, you saved me, Vivi.

2898
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,400
{Talk about having
a narrow escape from death. -OG}Talk about a narrow
escape from death.{Evo}

2899
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,190
I'm glad I'm alive.

2900
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,770
But...

2901
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,570
don't you think
my face is kinda swollen?

2902
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,570
I-It's frostbite! Frostbite!

2903
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,780
{\an8}My head feels kinda heavy...

2904
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,780
{This is why it's not easy
to be in a snowy area. -OG}This is why it's not easy
to be in the snow.{Evo}

2905
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,320
{\an8}{Or should I say my view
is kinda narrow... -OG}My view looks kinda narrow...{Evo}

2906
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,280
More importantly,

2907
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,200
{\an8}My lips are kinda big...

2908
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,830
{we have to figure out our location
and the situation we're in quickly! -OG}{we must figure out our location

2909
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,750
{\an8}Kinda... yeah, I agree...

2910
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,710
Ahhh! What's that?!

2911
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,460
Ahhh... That was close...
I saw a field of flowers...

2912
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,140
Suddenly hitting an avalanche in this cold...
I must've run out of luck.

2913
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,100
But this is a sort
of winter swimming, I guess.

2914
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,060
Zoro.

2915
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
Hm? Oh, Vivi.

2916
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,020
Huh?

2917
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,400
Oh, it's you, Usopp!
What're you guys doing here?

2918
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
– That's my question!
– That's my question!

2919
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,450
What idiots!

2920
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,750
That's what you lowly bunnies
get for going against the king!

2921
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,750
{Humph! I didn't think I'd use my
real power on mere bunnies, though. -OG}Humph! I didn't think I'd need to use
my real power on mere bunnies, though.{Evo}

2922
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,090
It couldn't be helped since they're
the most violent animal in Drum.

2923
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,390
Just wait... Straw Hat!

2924
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,280
Doctor...!

2925
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,910
D... Doctor...!

2926
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,930
Doctor...!

2927
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,430
Ah! Ow!

2928
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,100
Sanji!

2929
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,780
Th-That... That was close...

2930
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,450
Winter swimming?!

2931
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah. After swimming
in the river for a while,

2932
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,580
I had no idea where I was any more.

2933
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,670
{So I was walking while
doing muscle training, -OG}{So I wandered while
doing strength training, -Evo}So I just wandered while training,{Evo, from notes}

2934
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,300
and then I ended up in a forest.

2935
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,380
Dressed like that?
You're stupid, aren't you?

2936
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,640
Anyway, give me your coat, Usopp.

2937
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,100
No way.

2938
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,180
Nami-san might've gotten sick
due to mental exhaustion...

2939
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,100
Then your shoes!

2940
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,100
No!

2941
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,770
One of them!

2942
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,770
No!

2943
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,150
It's your own fault, isn't it?!

2944
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,320
Look over there! There're people.

2945
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,110
Hm?

2946
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,860
Hey... I remember those buildings...

2947
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,120
What?

2948
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,830
{You're right! This is Bighorn!
We ended up... coming back! -OG}You're right! This is Bighorn!
So we... circled back!{Evo, from notes}

2949
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,830
Step back! Step back!

2950
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Dalton is already dead!

2951
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
There's no way Dalton-san
would die from an attack like that!

2952
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,260
You guys used to serve
under Dalton didn't you?!

2953
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,890
Don't you care?!

2954
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,760
We're retainers of King Wapol!

2955
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,600
{If you become Wapol-sama's enemy,
you're dead meat! -OG}If you become an enemy of King Wapol,
you're dead meat!{Evo, from notes}

2956

Hey, what's the matter?

2957
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,310
Wh-What's the matter?

2958
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,270
What's the matter with you,
dressing like that?!

2959
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,150
Dalton-san's buried
under the snow of the avalanche!

2960
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,320
What?!

2961
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,990
{Dalton-san is?! -OG}Dalton-san is buried?!{Evo, from notes}

2962
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,410
Yeah. We can't dig him out
because those guys are in our way

2963
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,830
Step back! Step back!

Oh? You guys never learn, do you?

2984
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,850
Doctor... Doctor...
