I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

Share the good times and laugh.

I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

21
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,040
Big Sis!

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,850
Big Sis! What happened?!

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,450
Who is that? A man?!

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,900
What is a man doing in this land?!

25
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,270
What in the world happened?!

26
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,030
Oh I uhh...

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,700
He saw my back.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,810
Then he'll have to die.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,120
Huh?! H-How come?! I only saw her back!

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,110
I dunno why, but I could swear I've seen it somewhere before...

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,520
We would rather die than let anyone see what you saw on my back!

32
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,530
That thing? How come?

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,090
Who are you? How come?

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,990
Take everything you saw to the grave!

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,550
Love-Love Beam!

36
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,920
Huh? Slow-Slow?!

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,930
A Slow-Slow Beam?!

38
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Oh no!

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm turning slower! Slow...er...

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,220
Love-Love Beam!

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,250
Why won't he petrify?!

42
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,640
Does he not feel any excitement
from seeing me in the bath?!

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,580
That's not possible, Big Sis!

44
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,560
The beauty of your naked body would
charm anyone of any age or gender!

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,620
His fear of death must be
overpowering his wicked thoughts!

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,950
He's a pathetic yet lucky man!

47
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,480
I dunno what's going on
but I'm getting outta here!

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,160
I just wanna talk to someone important!

49
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,890
He jumped out from this height!

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,830
He won't get away!

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,360
Pistol Kiss!

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,100
Huh?! They don't bounce off!

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,440
They're not metal bullets?!

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,650
That man is an intruder!

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,920
Seize him, Kuja Pirates!

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,470
Y-Yes, ma'am!

57
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,210
A man?! What's a man doing here?!

58
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,840
Let's just catch him for now!

59
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,570
The Arena

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,970
Damn! Come off, you stupid things!

61
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,630
What are these iron rope-like snakes?!

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,860
We were too slow.

63
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,480
Let's just hope they don't
ask how he arrived here...

64
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,620
He's going to be killed, isn't he?

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,940
What's with this place?

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,710
There really isn't even one guy here.

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
Snake Princess!

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,790
Marigold-sama!

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,170
Sandersonia-sama!

70
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,670
Let me ask you this, man.

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,580
How and why did you come to this island?!

72
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,340
Seriously, I don't know either!

73
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,490
I suddenly went flying through the sky and before I realized it I was here!

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,810
Liar. You can't fool me with that ridiculous story.

75
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,330
You must be after something.

76
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,060
Well, you could give me a ship!

77
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,630
I'd appreciate getting a lift most of all,

78
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,990
but anyway there's a place
I need to leave for right away!

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,040
If you're the most important person here, then please! I want to set sail!

80
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,690
What nonsense is this?!

81
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,930
He must be plotting something!

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,630
You can't fool us!

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,150
I can keep fighting again and again!

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,720
How dare he speak so rudely and
tastelessly to the Snake Princess?!

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,260
He's appalling!

86
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't think you can leave this place alive.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,090
Your death is inescapable!

88
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,870
Please wait Snake Princess!

89
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,990
I-I don't think he's the
kind of person who can lie!

90
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,220
Marguerite!

91
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,550
Snake Princess.

92
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,430
E-Everything this man says is sincere.

93
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,860
He hardly seems like the type
to bring harm to our land!

94
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,550
Oh! You!

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,600
Yeah! Tell her for me!

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,100
A defense warrior?

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
My name is Marguerite!

98
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,050
The punishment of the crime of intruding into this kingdom,

99
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,980
which is forbidden to men, is death.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,050
Why are you defending him?

101
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,220
I feel I owe him.

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,820
The person who let him into this country...

103
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,620
...was I!

104
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,260
Marguerite! Why?!

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,330
Snake Princess! W-We can explain!

106
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,530
Yes!

107
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,690
We found him in the forest
covered in mushrooms!

108
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,310
We thought he was from the village
and carried him here!

109
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,690
Sweet Pea! Aphelandra!

110
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,820
We're also responsible for
the crime of bringing him here!

111
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,280
That's right!

112
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,130
Stop you two!

113
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm the one who suggested
bringing him to the village!

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,990
Does she know what this means?

115
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,700
Marguerite is way too honest!

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
Oh you guys!

117
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,520
You guys tried to kill me
but you're actually nice after all!

118
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,770
Only I'm guilty of letting
him into the country!

119
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,940
Marguerite!

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,110
It's all right.

121
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,300
Look up, honest Marguerite.

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,630
Love-Love Beam!

123
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,890
What the...?!

124
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,070
They did something stupid.

125
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,190
Hey, what happened to you?!

126
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,790
What happened?!

127
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,840
They turned into stone! Why?!

128
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,910
Hey, what did you do to them!?

129
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,400
They saved my life!

130
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,050
Yes, they have been punished for helping you.

131
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,020
Because of me!?

132
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,890
Wait! Turn them back to normal!

133
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,170
Bring Bacura to the arena!

134
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
Bacura!?

135
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,400
It's all over for that man now!

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,510
I told you to turn them back!

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,020
This place is the kingdom of the warriors, Amazon Lily,

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,180
where if you are powerful, you are beautiful.

139
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,250
You should die fighting.

140
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,470
We are gonna watch it.

141
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,860
That black panther's name is Bacura.

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,660
It is a carnivorous animal that was used as an executioner

143
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,660
by the empress of this kingdom for many generations.

144
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,060
After the execution, not even a single bone will remain.

145
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,700
What's gonna happen to these people?! Are they gonna turn back to normal?!

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,970
What a disrespectful way of speaking to the Snake Princess!

147
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,640
Go finish him, Bacura!

148
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,110
Bacura!

149
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,830
He's strong!

150
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,150
Bacura was defeated by a single hit?!

151
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,430
He didn't use Haki!

152
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,360
Then that was just brute strength?!

153
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,810
You guys are screwed up.

154
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,060
That woman...

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,460
Even after your comrades have been turned to stone by that woman,

156
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,370
why are you still laughing childishly?!

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,680
The savage is shouting at us!

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,740
Unbelievable! What a vicious creature!

159
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,990
We feel sorry for those three, but what Snake Princess did wasn't wrong!

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,220
They're the ones to blame!
They broke the rules of our land!

161
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,990
Whatever I do...

162
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,920
...I will be forgiven.

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,860
If you ask why...

164
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,050
Indeed...

165
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,220
It's because I'm beautiful!

166
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,370
Snake Princess!

167
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,610
You think so, too, right?

168
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,000
You're pissin' me off.

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,880
Sister, get a hold of yourself!

170
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,270
This is just ridiculous!

171
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,260
There can't possibly exist a man that can't be captured by my charm!

172
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,290
I can't bear that man's existence!

173
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,940
How dare you say that to the Snake Princess?!

174
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,160
Hurry and execute him!

175
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
Execution!

176
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,880
Execution! Execution!

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,240
Go! Marigold! Sandersonia!

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,180
Take that man's head!

179
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,850
Yes! Leave it to us Big Sis!

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,960
These guys use devil-fruit powers, too?

181
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,910
Execution!

182
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,940
Execution!

183
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,500
The younger sisters'
Snake Pit Dance is about to start!

184
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,460
{\an8}I can't wait to see Marigold-sama's
"Salamander" with my own eyes!

185
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,310
Youngest Sister Marigold Snake-Snake
Fruit Model King Cobra

186
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,050
{\an8}And Sandersonia-sama's
"Eight-Headed Serpent"!

187
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,990
Middle Sister Sandersonia
Snake-Snake Fruit Model Anaconda

188
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,760
How magnificent she looks!

189
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,650
This is proof that they defeated
the monster, Gorgon, and took its powers!

190
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,630
Even after they were cursed, the sisters are still beautiful!

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,550
Cursed?

192
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,400
What are they talking about?

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,340
No matter how you look at it, you just ate a Devil Fruit!

194
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,720
Execution! Execution!

195
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,900
Execution!...

196
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,540
Perhaps I should swallow him whole...

197
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,760
Or squeeze him to death...

198
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,760
Don't tell me he's scared stiff!

199
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880
Just stand there and die!

200
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,270
There!

201
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,600
They don't have any cracks, right?

202
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,970
You three wait here.

203
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,180
Sorry about this. Because of me you guys turned into stone.

204
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,010
If Chopper was here, I'd ask him to check on you right away.

205
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,230
It's just like when Robin and I were turned into ice by Aokiji.

206
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,720
You guys might be able to turn back to normal.

207
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,040
Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own safety instead of theirs?

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
Shut up! I can do whatever I want!

209
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
That man...

210
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Is he trying to save Marguerite and the others?

211
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,610
That can't be!

212
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,070
He's already been sentenced to death!

213
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,420
Well then...

214
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,540
Anyway, I just gotta beat you guys up, right?

215
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,510
No way!

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,510
What did that boy just say?

217
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,280
He thinks he can beat the sisters up?

218
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,370
Hilarious! Making people laugh
after being sentenced to death!

219
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,060
Men really are hilarious!

220
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,360
I can do that, right? Beat you up, I mean.

221
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,430
Yeah, sure you can.

222
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,040
If you haven't given up on your life yet, let me tell you something.

223
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,070
I wouldn't fall into the pit between
the seats and the ring if I were you!

224
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,420
I don't mind if it happens, but if you fall, you will be stabbed by the spikes below.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,550
Then, let's start.

226
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,750
Kill him, Sandersonia, Marigold!

227
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,920
For the crime of intruding on this island of women!

228
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
For the sin of insulting me,

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,200
show him the art of the punishment!

230
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,210
I've been waiting for this!

231
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,980
Take that, and that, and that!

232
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,220
He's not bad at this huh?

233
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,230
Get him Marigold-sama!

234
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,300
What the...?!

235
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,570
Poison?! That was close!

236
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,220
It's a deadly poison! Too bad for you!

237
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,600
Rubber...

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,890
Stamp!

239
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,620
It bounced off!

240
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,410
That hurts!

241
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,630
How...?! I'm made of rubber!

242
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,910
See! He really is all bark and no bite!

243
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,500
But it's true that men stretch! Interesting!

244
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,570
Huh?! Am I not rubber anymore?!

245
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,920
No that's not it!

246
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,910
Then why do impact blows hurt?!

247
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,220
That's unfair.

248
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,850
Don't hog all the fun yourself, Mari.

249
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,150
I want to have some fun with him too!

250
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,530
Why does that hurt?! I'm made of rubber!

251
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,200
The guy with the battle-axe was like that, too...

252
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,370
Does that mean it's not a Devil Fruit power?

253
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,980
I take it you have powers too.

254
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,530
Damn!

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,110
But I take it you can't use Haki?

256
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,600
Most outsiders can't.

257
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,560
That's why you're weak.

258
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,440
A kick with the left foot.

259
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
Over here!

260
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,700
She predicted my move!

261
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,390
Snake Slam!

262
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,290
Yes!

263
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,090
That one didn't hurt.

264
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,420
Same as usual.

265
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,330
Rubber...

266
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,220
Gatling!

267
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,970
Snake Dance!

268
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,890
What amazing moves!

269
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,550
With Sonia-sama's Haki
there's no attack she can't dodge!

270
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,560
You're very straightforward.

271
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,220
I can read you like a book.

272
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,620
What's going on?!

273
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,440
She's guessing my every move!

274
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,730
Focusing entirely on offense
is nice and all but...

275
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,150
Snake Stick!

276
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,730
Ouch!

277
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,370
Don't forget that there are two of us!

278
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,870
He's falling into the pit!

279
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
That was close!

280
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,920
The Snake Princess put
her hair behind her ear!

281
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,710
Her loveliness knows no bounds!

282
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,970
This man is the very definition
of "nothing but talk."

283
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,620
I can't help but laugh.

284
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,490
Shut up you dumbass!

285
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,160
Oh my!

286
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,980
He spoke abusively to
the Snake Princess again!

287
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,170
Unforgivable! Hurry and kill him!

288
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,500
Sonia! Mari!

289
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,170
End that man's life at once!

290
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,880
To ensure there are no further outbursts...

291
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,050
from his filthy mouth!

292
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,250
It looks like playtime is over now.

293
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,350
Let's give the criminal despair and death!

294
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,860
Hey! What're you doing?! Don't touch them!

295
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,650
What if she breaks?!

296
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,430
She saved my life you know!

297
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,870
We are going to break her.

298
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,360
You said she saved your life.

299
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
Then that's all the more reason to.

300
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,780
I feel bad for her, but this is your punishment.

301
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,050
Don't be stupid!

302
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,950
This duel is between me and you!

303
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,700
Damn! Let go!

304
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,730
You're the only one who
thinks this is a duel.

305
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,560
This is a public execution!

306
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,600
Just sit there and watch!

307
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,060
The emotional trauma you gave our
sister goes much further than this!

308
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,130
Everyone here looks up to the Snake Princess!

309
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,890
She's strong noble and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

310
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,800
The Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

311
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,300
Hey! Stop it!

312
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,060
She looked up to you guys you know!

313
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,810
Everyone in this land does.

314
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,020
So I think this is what she would want!

315
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,610
The hell it is!

316
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,230
What are you stupid?!

317
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,830
Oh my. What crude language.

318
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,340
Here goes!

319
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,670
Three...

320
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,000
Hey! Stop!

321
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,370
Two...

322
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,180
It's no use.

323
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,810
One...

324
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,720
Marguerite!

325
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,190
I told you to stop, dammit!!

326
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,190
The warriors are fainting!

327
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,230
There's no way...

328
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,190
What a relief!

329
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,100
She isn't hurt anywhere!

330
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,450
Oh I guess you guys are sensible after all!

331
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,400
Just now... that was the Conqueror's Haki!

332
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,530
This can't be real!

333
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,890
Only one in a million people is capable of using the Haki of the chosen ones.

334
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,870
I've never seen any person who
can use it other than our big sister!

335
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,570
This boy has the qualities of a king,
capable of standing above all others!

336
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,470
He has the Conqueror's Haki just like me?

337
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,960
How can this be?!

338
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,780
Is he no mere boy after all?!

339
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,360
Just who is that guy?!

340
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,120
What's everyone blabbing about?

341
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,430
What's the big deal?

342
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,510
He doesn't realize he used Haki?!

343
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,900
I guess he hasn't figured
out how to control it.

344
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,470
Alright!

345
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,790
You showed me you're strong!

346
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,720
Now let's get on with the duel.
