I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,530
Chasing and being chased on top of Mobius' ring.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,440
It begins, it expands, this flavor that exceeds imagination

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,730
I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,780
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,700
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,580
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:13,020
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:21,530
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:31,590
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,230
No One Can Stop This Now

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,470
What is the matter with me?

22
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,340
I do not wish to refuse Luffy's request...

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,180
So I said I would answer the summons...

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,580
Even so, I do not feel bad about it!

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,550
That is love!

26
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,390
The pain of yearning for the one whom you cannot see will weaken you until you die...

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,390
The previous empresses all fell in love,

28
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,390
yet as empresses, they had no choice but to
repress their feelings and remain on the island.

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,790
The pain from their suppressed feelings began to hurt them,

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,940
and eventually claimed their lives.

31
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,610
However, your decision to go with that man will save your life!

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
By answering the summons and
maintaining your position as a Warlord,

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,590
you will ensure the country's safety,

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,490
as well as help Monkey D. Luffy.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,290
I wonder, what star was that man born under?

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:50,440
Usually, any pirate who wants to go to the prison has to turn himself in...

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,540
Amazon Lily
Port

38
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,050
Wasn't he setting off tomorrow morning?

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,090
It seems that their destination changed.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,070
Seems like he's going to Central with Snake Princess!

41
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,880
Luffy!

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,760
You guys! I owe you so much for this...

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,720
Next time, I'll bring my friends here too!

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,510
Come to think of it, will that be alright?

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,560
Nami and Robin should be fine, but men aren't allowed in this country...

46
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,990
If they're your friends, then I think it would be fine.

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,560
It seems like this is the saga of "The Snake Princess Made a Special Exception For You", after all.

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,220
I'll be looking forward to it!

49
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,160
The saga of "So, You Were Here"?

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,350
Who would be so insolent...

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,890
as to leave...

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,410
a puppy and...

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,610
a baby seal blocking my path?!

54
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,030
Snake Princess!

55
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,050
Her sexy pranks know no bounds!!

56
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,410
I don't know when it happened, but she's even more beautiful than before!

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,740
I'm so sorry! It was all my fault...

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,980
Please be more careful.

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,210
I'm sorry that we gotta leave so suddenly.

60
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,170
Snake-woman! I wanna get going as soon as possible!

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,090
Oh, no! If I look into his eyes...

62
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,460
No, Luffy! It's rude of you to call her that!

63
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,300
You must address her as "Snake Princess"!

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,030
Please, call me Hancock.

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,950
Snake Princess!

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,370
Yeah, sure thing, Hammock!

67
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,250
It's "Hancock".

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,140
S-Snake Princess is smiling!

69
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,250
How many carats? How many carats was that smile?!

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,210
Too bright...

71
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,440
A woman in love...

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,660
I was like that once...

73
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,660
Huh? Elder Nyon, your face looks all distorted and ugly...

74
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,130
Silence!

75
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,230
Have a safe journey, Snake Princess!

76
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,140
Please come again, Luffy!

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,280
Luffy-chan!

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,100
See ya la'der!

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,120
Stop that already!

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,120
See ya la'der!

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,810
I told you my conditions on the Snail-Phone.

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,100
If this is about your request to make a stop at the Great Prison, Impel Down,

83
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,430
then I've managed to get permission from above.

84
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,730
Pirates, especially the Seven Warlords, are forbidden to approach the prison.

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,280
Only you and that snake will be coming, correct?

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,890
This is a special case.

87
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,040
There's no time, so you won't be able to stay there for long.

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,580
Then, Big Sister, please be careful.

89
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,710
Make sure you come back alive, Big Sister.

90
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,380
We will pray for your safety, Snake Princess!
Take care, Snake Princess!

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,510
Luffy, you take care t-

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,220
I will be going, then.

93
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,320
I leave the kingdom to you for the time being.

94
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,680
Yes!

95
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,500
The wait was worth it.

96
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,990
Now, it seems I'll be able to fulfill my mission.

97
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,340
First, could you do something about my petrified crew?

98
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,380
Are they all dead?

99
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,530
Awaken.

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,150
...ck-sama!

101
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,080
...What?

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,920
Get the ship moving, fools!

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,860
Uh, yes! Right away!

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,280
Before we go to Marineford, we head for Impel Down!

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,140
Navy Headquarters

106
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,420
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

107
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,290
We've gotten a message from Vice Admiral Momonga!

108
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,040
Apparently, the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,880
finally responded and is on her way here!

110
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,370
Finally. I sure hope she makes it in time.

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,850
That woman is strong.

112
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,860
Now we have six of the Seven Warlords gathered.

113
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,190
What about the last one, still sitting in prison?

114
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,500
Has he come to his senses?

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,660
No, he's still completely against this fight.

116
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,710
It seems he's even ready to accept losing his position as a Warlord.

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,310
I thought he'd be our strongest supporter in this case...

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,360
To think that he'd be this opposed to it...

119
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,150
Damn that Jinbei...

120
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,540
Reporting in!

121
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,940
Fleet Admiral!

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,420
It's about those 500 pirates that Admiral Kizaru captured on Sabaody Archipelago...

123
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,270
Impel Down says they don't have the manpower to handle them all...

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,110
Talk to the Labor Department!

125
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,170
Don't ask me for anything unrelated to the Whitebeard case!

126
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,300
Oh, and the World Noble, Saint Rosward demands...

127
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,530
Let the Admirals deal with him!

128
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,110
What about Garp?

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,210
Vice-Admiral Garp has gone to Impel Down.

130
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,030
What does he think he's doing?!

131
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,230
Doing whatever he pleases at such a crucial moment...

132
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,250
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

133
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,300
This is an emergency!

134
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,490
Whitebeard has made his move!

135
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,320
So, he's coming... the patrol ships reported it?

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,790
Patch me through so they can confirm it themselves.

137
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,590
Well, you see...

138
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,050
All 23 ships we had keeping an eye on
Whitebeard's flagship, the Moby Dick...

139
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,850
just vanished. We can't contact them.

140
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,000
W-What?!

141
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,940
Apparently, there have been suspicious movements among other pirates in the New World as well!

142
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,570
We can't get any information on how many of them there are or when they will come here!

143
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,690
We sent out another patrol, but...

144
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,480
He got us!

145
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,930
He's already started to move, hasn't he?

146
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,030
We have no idea where he'll strike...

147
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,020
As long as we've got Ace imprisoned...

148
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,290
We need to tell everyone that it is possible that there might be a showdown in Impel Down!

149
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,800
Yessir!

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,660
Great Prison
Impel Down

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,660
This way, Vice-Admiral Garp.

152
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,080
Take care!

153
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Sure.

154
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,390
Well, you sure look pitiful...

155
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,520
You still alive there...

156
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,790
Ace?

157
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,130
Old man...

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,540
And now, we will travel back in time a little...

159
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh dear, oh dear...

160
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,110
Hey...hey...hey...young lady?

161
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,760
Hey...hey...hey...young lady?

162
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,560
Where did you come from, young lady?

163
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,190
Quit repeating yourself.

164
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,240
What is it?

165
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,650
Have you calmed down?

166
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,420
You're not gonna attack me any more, are you?

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Ta-dah!

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,780
Now, have a look...

169
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,060
at these firmly tied "knots of wind"!

170
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,080
Untie one and...

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,530
...it summons a gentle breeze.

172
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,550
Untie another, and...

173
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,360
...it summons a strong wind.

174
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,370
Untie the third, and...

175
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,880
...it summons a storm!

176
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,560
What are you doing?!

177
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,850
I thought it would cheer you up...

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,110
I feel better now, thank you very much!

179
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,010
This is Weatheria, a small Sky-Island.

180
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,670
It's a country dedicated to researching weather.

181
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,420
S-Sky-Island?!

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,420
Grand Line "Winter Island"

183
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,010
Wait!

184
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,450
Stop it, Taroimo!

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,990
Wait!

186
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,120
It's a human!

187
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,630
Um, are you alright?

188
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,550
He mistook you for a monster...

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,390
Yeah, I'm fine.

190
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,850
How can you be alright?!

191
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,240
Still, this is bad...

192
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,600
How far did I fly?

193
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,350
Ugh, it's cold! Is this a snow-country?!

194
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,480
Franky!

195
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,690
This is bad!

196
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,190
He's walking around in the snow wearing only a speedo!

197
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,220
Did someone rob him?

198
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,150
Here, put on this loincloth.

199
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,860
Loincloth?! Get real!

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,670
Mind your own business!

201
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,410
If I'd...

202
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,850
...put that on...

203
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,820
...I'd be a disgrace...

204
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
...to all perverts!

205
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,540
Follow along!

206
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,500
Move your butt to the right!

207
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,110
Right hand on the hips...

208
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,490
...and thrust your left hand out!

209
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,140
Slide...

210
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,350
...to the left!

211
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,060
Right! Left!

212
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,670
And again!

213
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,730
Yeah!

214
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,920
One! Two!

215
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Super!

216
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,710
Whew, this is the best!

217
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,690
I'm still cold!

218
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,030
Where is this?!

219
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
Huh?

220
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,620
This is Mechanical Island's future kingdom of Bulgemore.

221
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,090
The kingdom where geniuses are born.

222
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,110
This is the Island of Dreams in the Grand Line...

223
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,190
Peachy Island.

224
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,910
This is the island known as the second Island of Women.

225
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,470
Everything from the trees to the sea is purely pink.

226
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,140
The humans and animals gathered on this island...

227
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,580
...all possess maiden hearts.

228
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,210
What kind of heaven is this?!

229
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,480
Wait up~!

230
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,790
You're like us!

231
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,640
You are, right?!

232
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,440
Shut up! Don't follow me!

233
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
I keep telling you, I'm not!

234
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,600
To my dear Nami-san and Robin-chan...

235
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
Are you doing well?

236
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,330
Wait! Wait!

237
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,360
Wait up, dammit!

238
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,070
No way I'd wait!!

239
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,180
Welcome to the Kamabakka kingdom!

240
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,460
Right now...

241
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm in Hell.

242
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,720
These islands, blossoming in the sea like flowers, are called the Bowin Islands.

243
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,540
How are you doing?

244
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,460
You're doing too well, dammit!

245
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,050
You gonna eat this?

246
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,070
No way!

247
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,420
But still, you saved me. Thanks!

248
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,940
I don't know who you are, but...

249
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
My name is Heracles'un!

250
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,450
Wow, that's a really cool name.

251
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,720
You think'un?

252
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,700
I'm Usopp. Nice to meet you.

253
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,280
Is this edible?

254
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,210
I've never seen a fruit like this before.

255
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,670
It's alright'un, Usopp'un.

256
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,930
And...My name is...

257
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,510
Heracles'un!

258
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,480
I got it. You're cool.

259
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,610
It sure smells good...

260
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,460
I'll just give it a lick...

261
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,530
Usopp'un!

262
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,680
W-What was that?!

263
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,840
Was that thing trying to eat me?!

264
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,200
Of cours'un. It's a man-eating plant'un.

265
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,180
Man-eating?!

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,350
What is with this place?!

267
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,750
This is the highwayman's forest, Grinston.

268
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,500
H-h-help!!!

269
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,950
Grand Line
Lazy Bones Island

270
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,950
Land of
Poverty

271
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,230
I-Is this the Devil?

272
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,990
We really managed to summon him with our black magic!

273
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,370
What a frightening appearance!

274
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,160
He's clearly not of this world...

275
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,480
Our wish can be fulfilled!

276
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
We can have our revenge on those people!

277
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,810
We have nothing left!

278
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,380
We will have our revenge on the Longarm tribe, who have taken everything from us!

279
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,810
King of Demons, Satan-sama...

280
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,520
If you will fulfill our wishes,

281
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,530
then every one of us will surrender our very souls to you!

282
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,890
Please rain death upon them!

283
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,270
How far can I have flown?

284
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,960
I have to go back...

285
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,530
Back to where the others are!

286
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,110
Please wait!

287
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,360
Please do not return to Hell, Satan-sama!

288
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
We must keep him here, whatever it takes!

289
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
Maybe we didn't offer enough sacrifices?

290
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
What could Satan-sama want?

291
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,120
Maybe a living sacrifice?

292
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,140
Blood?

293
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,930
Where is this place?

294
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,440
Excuse me...

295
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,040
May I see your panties?

296
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,130
P-Panties!

297
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,420
Hurry and show him your underwear!

298
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,340
East Blue
Country on the bridge
Tequila Wolf

299
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,800
This is a country of laborers.

300
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,180
Pull! Pull!

301
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,090
The people working here are all criminals from other countries,

302
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,120
or inhabitants from countries that
refused to join the World Government.

303
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,440
Stand up! Stand up!

304
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,800
I guess you could call them slaves.

305
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,720
When will this bridge be completed?

306
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
It'll probably take a while...

307
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,200
We've been working on it for seven hundred years, after all.

308
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
Seven hundred years? What for?

309
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
You have no need to know.

310
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,650
You're one of our workers now,
so you just have to build the bridge!

311
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,130
South Blue

312
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,900
What's with these birds?!

313
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,510
They're too big!

314
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
You wanna eat me?!

315
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,940
My body's not listening to me!

316
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,390
I'm... safe...?

317
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,760
It's a raccoon dog. How rare!

318
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,460
We having raccoon dog stew.

319
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,210
Stop it! I'm a reindeer!

320
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,540
Then we be having reindeer stew...

321
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,830
Huh? It talk just now?

322
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,620
Legends say that this is a treasure island...

323
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,760
Torino Kingdom where birds reign over humans...

324
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,360
Grand Line Gloom Island

325
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,460
Muggy Kingdom

326
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,050
It's true, I did tell him that...

327
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,920
"If I were to go on a vacation, I'd like to go to a dark, gloomy, haunted old castle...

328
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,020
...where I'd spend my days singing cursed songs."

329
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,790
Damn you, Kuma!

330
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,630
But no one told me there wouldn't be any servants here!

331
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,460
No one told me that I wouldn't get to wake up in a soft bed, being served a bagel sandwich with warm cocoa!

332
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,510
No one told me there wouldn't be any cute stuffed animals here!!!

333
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,270
Where am I? Moria-sama!

334
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,810
I want to go back to Thriller Bark!

335
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,190
Could it be...?

336
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,980
I knew it! Someone else got sent here!

337
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,770
I sure hope it's somebody cute!

338
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,920
H-He's...

339
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,040
...one of Straw Hat's crew!

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,060
He must have been defeated by Kuma...

341
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,480
He isn't dead yet?

342
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm alive...

343
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,430
Where am I?

344
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,210
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,020
I should be asking you that!

346
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,970
Crying out all of a sudden...

347
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,920
Where are my swords?

348
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,720
Oh, you want your weapons back?

349
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,810
Why, you...!

350
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
Returning to the present...

351
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,670
Luffy intends to help his brother Ace escape,

352
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,770
and is crossing the waves, heading toward Impel Down.

353
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,660
How many times must I repeat myself before you understand?!

354
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,000
You ought to remember it after the first time, you imbecile.

355
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,970
My meals must weigh no less than 100 kilograms!

356
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,420
Any less than that, it will not satisfy my hunger!

357
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,180
Do you wish for me to turn you to stone again?!

358
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,770
N-No! Please forgive me!

359
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,710
I'll be more precise this time!

360
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,120
Someone bring her another meal now!

361
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,500
I-Is that-?

362
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,100
They're examples...

363
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,430
That's what happens to anyone who tries to peek into Hancock's room!

364
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,160
Scary!

365
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,060
Here, Luffy. Dig in!

366
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,270
This is delicious!

367
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,260
And the fact that you're feeding it to me makes the meal even better!

368
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,110
Oh, you don't mean that...

369
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,240
If only that would happen...

370
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,590
Hey, what're you doin' over there in the corner?

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,010
You're not eating anything? This Sea King-meat tastes awesome.

372
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,080
I-I am fine...

373
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,550
My heart is already full...

374
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,800
I sure ate a lot!

375
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,290
That was great!

376
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,780
L-Luffy!

377
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,210
Have you forgotten that you are a fugitive?

378
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,420
Hancock! Do you have someone else in your room?

379
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,260
Oh, no!

380
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,280
Lieutenant Stalker, are you sure about what you heard?

381
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,510
Yessir! I definitely heard someone say "Bwah! I sure ate a lot"!

382
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,890
Do you really think the empress would say something like that?

383
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,260
No way!

384
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,700
If that was her, then I'll shave my hair into a Mohawk!

385
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,350
I sure ate a lot!

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,550
She said it!

387
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,040
Please remove the dishes.

388
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,200
The meal was satisfying.

389
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,550
Do not forget, I need five portions like this every day.

390
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,130
That much?!

391
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,100
But then we won't have anything to eat!

392
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,020
I would not care if you were to die.

393
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,800
You're horrible!

394
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,190
But you're so beautiful~!

395
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,700
Six days remain before Portgas D. Ace's execution.

396
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,420
Whitebeard has eliminated the scouts sent to watch him,

397
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,250
doubling the tension at Navy HQ.

398
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,240
The port of Marineford is now crowded

399
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,720
with well-known, strong marines returning from their outposts all around the world.

400
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,390
All forces who carry the name of "Justice"...

401
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,160
have gathered at Navy HQ.

402
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,050
Meanwhile, in the Holy Land of Mariejoa,

403
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,970
the assembled members of the Seven Warlords

404
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,600
are instructed to form their own battle unit.

405
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,860
It is a gathering of unruly misfits.

406
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,610
There is but one thing that can be said for certain:

407
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,490
The idea of these men fighting together is unthinkable.

408
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,790
Kill you, you say?

409
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,840
Fool!

410
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,830
Anything we could do now would be pointless.

411
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,840
Even if you died right now,
it wouldn't stop Whitebeard.

412
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,840
Nobody can stop this now.

413
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,510
We have angered...

414
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,920
...the king of the sea!
