I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

Share the music, even if it's far.

Share the one dream, by telling each other.

Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:13,020
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:21,530
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:31,590
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,390
Alright...

21
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,570
Now it's my turn to go full-power too.

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,590
Gear Second!

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
What is that?!

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,500
Smoke's coming from his body!

25
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,470
Is that how men are?!

26
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,250
In that case, I'll bite you to death
with all the power I have too!

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,470
Medusa Hair...

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,000
Eight-Headed Serpent!

29
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,430
Go!

30
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,400
Sandersonia-sama!

31
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,320
The fence around the arena!

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,270
The giant serpents are actually her hair,

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,740
yet it's like they have fangs of iron!

34
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,910
Why can't I hit him?!

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm reading his every move ahead of time,

36
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,190
but I can't keep up!

37
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,930
Rubber...

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,760
It's no use!

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,630
Your attacks bounce right off,
as I showed you before!

40
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,200
Jet...

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,980

Sonia! Mari!

43
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,460
What are you two playing around for?!

44
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,160
B-Big Sis...!

45
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,650
S-Sorry, Big Sis!

46
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,370
We'll finish him at once!

47
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,110
She's on fire!

48
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,640
Medusa Hair...

49
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,290
Salamander!

50
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,490
We won't give you anywhere to run!

51
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,090
He's surrounded!

52
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,510
There's no escape now,
no matter how nimble he is!

53
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,260
There's no better attack than this!

54
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,770
Rubber...

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,310
Jet...

56
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,900
Gatling!

57
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh no!

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,770
Big Sis Sonia! Get away, quickly!

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,540
What?! I'm being dragged!

60
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,940
Our tails! When did he...?!

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,330
It's hot! It's hot! Help!

62
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,530
Wait, Big Sis! Don't pull me!

63
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,330
Big Sis Sonia! Watch out!

64
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,490
That's the pit of blades!
Hold on to the stands!

65
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,170
Th-That was close...

66
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,040
S-Sandersonia-sama?!

67
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,280
Ouch! Hot!

68
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,790
He's kicking her when she's down!

69
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,790
He's inhuman!

70
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,890
He's going to knock Sonia-sama
into the pit and skewer her!

71
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,170
Damn you, man!

72
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,140
Don't move!

73
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,620
Even if you guys wanna kill me,

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I don't wanna kill you!

75
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,910
You insolent little...!

76
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,430
Mari! Use this chance to kill him!

77
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
What are you doing, Mari?!

78
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,590
I can't, Big Sis Sonia...!

79
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,090
Because...

80
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,790
he's protecting us right now...!

81
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,400
Look! Sandersonia-sama's
clothing burned off

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,190
and her back is showing!

83
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,790
If that man gets off her,
her Gorgon Eyes will be exposed!

84
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,740
Oh no!

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,120
Everyone who sees them
will be turned to stone!

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,620
My back...!

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,360
You guys said so earlier!

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,770
We would rather die than let anyone see what you saw on my back!

89
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,600
You'd rather die than let
people see this, right?!

90
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,950
So don't move!

91
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,240
The combat is over!

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,350
Everyone leave the arena at once before you're exposed to the Gorgon Eyes!

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh no! We gotta get outside!

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,650
We'll be petrified!

95
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,680
Hurry! Hurry!

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
The Gorgon's curse!

97
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,960
I was fighting you just moments ago.

98
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,680
Why are you protecting me?

99
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,950
What you don't want to be seen has nothing to do with our fight.

100
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:13,870
Hancock's Confession

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,690
We're sorry, Big Sis!

102
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,010
We're sorry that we lost and
had to be saved by our enemy.

103
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,080
Are you up next?

104
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,530
That's enough.

105
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,430
I don't feel like it.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Oh, yeah?

107
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,600
I hope that she's not damaged.

108
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,100
Alright then,

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,970
these people you turned to stone;
turn them back.

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,740
You can do something, right?

111
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,110
They were just trying to defend me!

112
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,580
They didn't do anything wrong!

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,020
Hey, please?!

114
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes, indeed,

115
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
I can revert them if I want.

116
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,460
But...

117
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,820
You said that you want
to go someplace by ship.

118
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes, my crew's waiting for me.

119
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Oh, that's nice.

120
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,400
But I can only make
one of your wishes come true.

121
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,020
It's either revert them

122
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,740
or help you to get off this island.

123
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,710
Choose one wish and give up on the other!

124
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,280
Reveal your true nature, Man.

125
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
That's great! Thank you!

126
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,520
That means you're going to help them, right?

127
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,190
Thank you... very much!!

128
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,370
He doesn't hesitate at all.

129
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,040
How is it that a man who has such great Haki

130
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,900
bows his head in order
to save his benefactors...

131
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,570
Coliseum Exit

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,510
Marguerite!

133
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,860
Sweetpea!

134
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,910
Aphelandra!

135
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, here you all are!

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,650
Great! She turned you back from stone!

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,420
I was so worried because you
suddenly started to vouch for him.

138
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,170
She's right.

139
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,990
I was afraid of what would happen to you.

140
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
Turned us back?

141
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,090
What happened to us?

142
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,900
I have absolutely no recollection.

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,200
Don't you remember?

144
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,510
No I don't...

145
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,810
The next thing I knew, that man
was there and he was really happy.

146
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,270
Oh, I'm so relieved!

147
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,940
I was worried that you were going to die.

148
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,320
No one's here...

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,620
Is it all finished now?

150
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
...And that was it.

151
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,130
Looks like your memory from right before and after you were turned to stone is gone.

152
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,960
We'll tell you what happened after that.

153
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,380
Marguerite.

154
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,760
What happened to the man?

155
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,460
What about Snake Princess?

156
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,660
Did she turn him to stone this time?

157
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,790
I don't know that much,

158
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,670
but it seems like he got
summoned to the Kuja Castle.

159
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,940
What?!

160
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
Amazon Lily,
Kuja Castle

161
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,790
Hey, I want to know!
What do you want from me?

162
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,640
Oh!

163
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,950
Is there a meal after the battle?

164
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,450
If that's what it is, I'll be happy!

165
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:21,980
The Princess's Hall

166
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,790
We really need to thank you...

167
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,870
You have our gratitude.

168
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,480
Nah, it's fine.

169
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,130
It's not like I can eat your gratitude.

170
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,560
If anybody had seen what's on our backs,

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,230
there is no way that we
could stay in this country.

172
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,900
You may come in.

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,650
Come inside, Man.

174
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,640
Inside?

175
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,520
Inside of the curtain.

176
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,580
Oh, is that where the food is?

177
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,660
I'm coming...

178
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,340
Oh, we're not eating.

179
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,550
Hey, what are you doing
with your clothes off?

180
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,530
As always, you are reacting rudely.

181
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,590
Very well...

182
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,200
This is the mark...

183
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,440
that you said...

184
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,570
you had seen somewhere.

185
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,110
Take a good look at it, again.

186
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,510
Where did you see this?

187
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,940
Do you know the meaning of this mark?

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,090
Answer me, now!

189
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,130
It's not something I want to show people.

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,170
As I suspected, it's a bit different
from what I've seen before.

191
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,400
I have a friend called Hachi
who is a fish-man...

192
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,480
And he has a similar mark on his forehead so I thought it was the same.

193
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
I don't know anything about your mark.

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,210
If he doesn't know, why don't you tell him?

195
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,450
Granny Nyon!

196
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,920
Where did you come in from?

197
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,250
Be honest, Snake Princess.

198
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,560
You have seen clearly
how tolerant that man is.

199
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,350
Don't be afraid.

200
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,900
Tell him everything that you want to share.

201
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,230
You!

202
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,240
You are a pirate,
Monkey D. Luffy, am I right?

203
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,320
Yes, I am.

204
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,310
How do you know about me?

205
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,170
How can you be so casual after you caused such a sensation in the world?

206
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,340
Look at this newspaper!

207
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,550
Just the other day,

208
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,500
on the Sabaody Archipelago, close to the world's Center of Power,

209
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,920
this man attacked a Celestial Dragon!

210
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,660
That's an act that only one who does not fear the wrath of gods would perform!

211
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,560
A Celestial Dragon?!

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,160
In response to this, the government dispatched their greatest military forces, but he miraculously escaped.

213
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,840
After that incident,

214
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,110
he somehow made it to our distant kingdom in a mere two days!

215
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,820
It's all beyond our understanding.

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,870
I'm telling you, I was sent flying all of a sudden!

217
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,120
I have no idea where this place is!

218
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,660
And I don't regret attacking that Celestial Dragon.

219
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,060
Do you know that bastard did to my friends?

220
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,800
Then, that means...

221
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,650
You really did stand up to the Celestial Dragons?

222
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,480
So...

223
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,910
Such a fool...

224
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,140
still existed in this world?

225
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,520
Someone who would defy the heavens with no regard for his own life...

226
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,230
just like he did!

227
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,330
Who are you talking about?

228
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,280
I will tell you everything...

229
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,820
Even the meaning behind the symbol branded into your friend's forehead.

230
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,950
Hachi's mark?

231
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,250
This is...

232
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,160
the Hoof of the Dragon Galloping Across the Heavens...

233
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,860
The crest of the Celestial Dragons!

234
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,340
It is burned onto the flesh of those bought by the World Nobles.

235
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,540
It is a symbol that will never disappear, forever marking the bearer as less than human!

236
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
The Celestial Dragons?

237
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,120
We three sisters...

238
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,050
were once...

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,010
slaves of the World Nobles!

240
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,630
You were... slaves?!

241
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,200
It happened when I was twelve years old...

242
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,580
I bet you're hungry! I brought a snack!

243
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,310
Hancock?

244
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,380
Sonia! Mari! Where are you?

245
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,820
Three of us were taken
from the Kuja pirate ship...

246
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,220
...and we were sold!

247
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,690
Everything after that...

248
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,100
is a disgusting past which I do not wish to be reminded of.

249
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,410
The first men I ever saw in my life were a terrifying crowd...

250
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,360
Sister Sonia, calm down!

251
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,590
The memories haunts us...

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,070
W-Wow! H-Hey! That's enough!

253
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,700
Don't force yourselves! You don't have to tell me!

254
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,310
It was awful.

255
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,000
There was no hope.

256
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,960
We kept thinking about death!

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
Hey! You...

258
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,670
But...

259
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,350
...one night four years later,

260
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,540
something happened that made
the World Government tremble.

261
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,960
Nobody dared stand against the Celestial Dragons.

262
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,610
That was an undisputed law.

263
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,740
But then came a man who climbed the Red Line bare-handed,

264
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,030
and snuck into the Holy Land Mariejoa, home of the Celestial Dragons.

265
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,140
He was an adventurer who would one day come to command an entire crew of fishman pirates...

266
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,260
Fisher Tiger.

267
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,760
He entered the city responsible for so much cruelty towards his fellow fishmen,

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,260
and razed it to the ground in order to free the fishman slaves.

269
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,710
We are free! We are free!

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,820
He disliked humans as a species

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,090
but he was being fair to all slaves,

272
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,620
and let thousands of slaves
of different species go free.

273
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,060
We prepared to die and ran among the others.

274
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,370
We owe him an immeasurable debt.

275
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,530
Tiger released many fish-men to the sea,

276
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,280
but ones who were slaves had
a mark that cannot be erased.

277
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Tiger has made the World Government his enemy

278
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,860
and he formed the
Sun Pirates with former slaves

279
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,300
and sailed out into the open sea.

280
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,310
As though breaking a curse,

281
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,300
he changed the Celestial Dragon's
emblem on everyone's bodies...

282
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,160
...into the symbol of the sun.

283
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,350
What you thought was similar
to the mark on my back is

284
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,450
the sun symbol of the Sun Pirates.

285
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,470
Yeah, you're right.

286
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,720
The one Hachi has on his
forehead looks like the sun.

287
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,030
Does that mean he was a slave, too?

288
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,420
It doesn't necessarily mean that he was.

289
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,120
The mark is made in such a way
that it is impossible to tell...

290
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,390
...whether they are former slaves or not.

291
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,340
I'm pretty sure that he once was
a member of the Sun Pirates.

292
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,340
In fact, Fisher Tiger is already dead and...

293
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,680
...the Sun Pirates have split
up into several groups.

294
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,490
I guess Hachi has led a complicated life, too...

295
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,770
So this is the reason
that the mark on our backs

296
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,390
is similar to the fish-men's mark.

297
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,960
Okay, I pretty much understand.

298
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,770
Ironically, the Devil Fruits we were given as slaves to entertain our masters,

299
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,330
the Love Fruit and the Snake Fruits,

300
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,410
were what made it possible for us to deceive the country and protect our secret.

301
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,130
If you didn't cover up
Sonia's back at that moment,

302
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,350
it would have been impossible
for us to stay on this island.

303
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,190
I don't want to let anyone
know about our past!

304
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
Even if it means deceiving the entire kingdom...

305
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,740
We must never let our guard down for as long as we live!

306
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,210
We will never be slaves again!

307
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,850
The idea of being at someone else's mercy...

308
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,990
It is too frightening for me to endure...!

309
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
Big Sister...

310
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,460
Ho!

311
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,770
But this is the first time in a long time

312
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,170
since you were this sincere about your own feelings.

313
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,870
I was actually wondering if your heart had turned to ice by now.

314
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,540
Be silent, you traitor who abandoned the kingdom!

315
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,810
You are the one who should be silent!

316
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,840
After you had been freed from the Celestial Dragons,

317
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,950
you were just a defenseless little girl...

318
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,920
Wandering around, and not knowing how to return to the island!

319
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,860
Who do you think it was who brought you all the way back here?!

320
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,100
You should be thankful that
I was living outside of this country!

321
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,240
You try to change my mind because of such a small debt?

322
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,430
What did you say?!

323
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,440
Granny Nyon...

324
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,040
I always keep an eye on
you three as a mother would!

325
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,640
Do you...

326
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,320
hate me, now that you know that I was a slave?

327
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,850
I told you, I hate the Celestial Dragons!

328
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,180
I've taken a liking to you!

329
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,100
Didn't you say that you had one more wish?

330
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,080
All right!

331
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,530
Where do you want to go?
I'll give you a ride!

332
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,370
For real?!

333
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,050
Departure will be tomorrow morning.

334
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,440
The Kuja Pirates will give you a
ride to the Sabaody Archipelago.

335
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,890
--What?! By our pirate ship?
--Sorry to be a pain!

336
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,850
Rest well tonight to prepare for tomorrow.

337
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,560
I can't wait to get off this island tomorrow!

338
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,070
Why can't you get it? It's like this!

339
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,840
Like this! This!

340
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,180
This!

341
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,150
Is it like this?

342
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,820
That's so funny, Luffy-sama!

343
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,100
Men stick chopsticks in their nasal cavities
to their mouth

344
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,360
and hold baskets in their hand...

345
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,200
What a classless dance!

346
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,270
Rubber... Belly-talk!

347
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,940
This is the specialty of Maiden Island!

348
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,490
What? Specialty?

349
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,350
Penne gorgonzola with Sea King meat.

350
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,190
I often eat Sea King meat
but this is different!

351
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,360
It really does stretch!

352
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,260
It's soft like gum!

353
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,690
Your time's up!

354
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,760
--What? One more time!
--No, then you won't stop!

355
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,060
Wow, this Sea King meat is
very good! It's hard to eat...

356
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,430
W-W-What are you doing - picking
and stretching my body?!

357
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,670
We can't help it! You'll
leave tomorrow, right?

358
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,810
There are a lot of people who
want to touch you just one time.

359
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,510
See!

360
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,750
{\an8}"20 gol per touch"

361
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,650
--You're so popular!
--Luffy-chan!

362
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,750
You can't do business using
me without asking me!!

363
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,190
Come on, Luffy-chan! Tonight is
our only chance to touch a man!

364
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,700
Hey! S-Stop, you people!
I can't eat! Hey! Hey!

365
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,100
Where's Marguerite?

366
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,350
--Where did Luffy-sama go?
--No! He ran away!

367
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,810
He can't have gotten too far!
Let's find him and touch him!

368
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,700
What's the matter with them?

369
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,120
Keep hiding!

370
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,000
This is the only food that I could bring.

371
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,170
It's great that you can
return to your friends!

372
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,810
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that
I got you into some trouble.

373
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,970
I worried when you turned into stone!

374
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,210
But you protected us, right?

375
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,840
I heard what happened.

376
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,340
Thank you, Luffy!

377
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,150
What's the matter, Marguerite?

378
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,360
Luffy's been chased by girls of the village.

379
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,570
No wonder. They don't see men often.

380
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,190
Hey, Granny Bean!

381
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,610
This part of the village is
secluded. Stay here for a while.

382
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,030
And my name's not Bean!!

383
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,700
He has something to eat, so just
bring him tea or something.

384
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
Okay.

385
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,170
Granny, you like to read newspapers, huh?

386
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,470
The News Coos don't deliver to the Calm Belt,

387
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,000
so it's hard to get these.

388
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,080
The empress of this kingdom is a Warlord of the Sea,

389
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,430
I have to know what's going
on in the world at least.

390
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,090
Who's a Warlord of the Sea?

391
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,690
Snake Princess.

392
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,190
What?!

393
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,190
She's a Warlord of the Sea?

394
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,910
Does that mean she's
really strong in a fight?

395
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,220
You are a pirate.
Didn't you notice it?

396
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,640
N-No, I didn't.

397
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,310
Don't you read newspapers?

398
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,610
No, I don't read them.

399
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,100
Oh, what a shock!

400
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,010
Snake Princess became
empress of this country

401
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,880
and a captain of the
Kuja Pirates 11 years ago.

402
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,560
She was still so young, but after just one voyage, a bounty of 80 million was put on her head.

403
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Just one voyage?

404
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,010
It had to do with the bad reputation
Kuja had even before her.

405
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,900
The World Government became
cautious about her from the start

406
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,570
and they suggested that she become
one of the Seven Warlords.

407
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,950
But now, that title is about to be revoked.

408
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,990
W-What?!

409
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,200
The Seven Warlords and Navy Headquarters

410
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,020
are gonna fight
the Whitebeard Pirates?!

411
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,570
What's that?! What'll happen?!
W-W-W-W-Wait a minute!

412
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,900
T-This is too much to hear at once!

413
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,030
What a foolish man!
You don't know anything.

414
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,790
I must say, that was just a prediction.

415
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,580
But the battle will probably happen.

416
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,550
The World Government has made a move.

417
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,790
Whitebeard is a man who would never
allow his mates to be killed.

418
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,680
Even though they know this, they
announced the public execution of...

419
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,530
Portgas D. Ace, a great
commander of Whitebeard's.

420
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,140
Of who?

421
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,730
Ace. "Fire Fist" Ace.

422
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,200
What's wrong?

423
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,640
Ace... is gonna get executed?

424
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,640
I heard a pirate called Blackbeard...

425
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,320
...became a Warlord of the Sea by
defeating "Fire Fist" Ace.

426
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,150
Blackbeard...

427
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,700
The World Government will take full
advantage of this big fish they've caught,

428
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,030
a pirate named Ace...

429
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,720
Granny...

430
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,900
Granny!!

431
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,970
He's my brother!

432
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,540
Ace is my older brother!

433
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,140
What?!

434
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,620
Is that true?! He's your brother?!

435
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,840
I didn't know that he was captured.

436
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,050
And he's gonna be executed?!
Then, there's no chance for him to escape!

437
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,230
If Whitebeard wins this battle,
there will be a chance for him.

438
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,060
What should I do? Where are
they gonna execute him?

439
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,770
It'll take place Marinford's town square,

440
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,610
where Navy Headquarters stands.

441
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,240
It says "in one week," which
means 6 days from today.

442
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,340
What?! That's too soon!

443
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,080
How long will it take to get to
Sabaody Archipelago from here?

444
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,020
It will take more than a week.

445
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,020
If it takes that long, then Ace will
be finished before I meet my crew!

446
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,420
Then how long will it take
to get to where Ace is?

447
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,860
Impel Down is where he locked, and
it'll take a week by a pirate ship

448
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,030
and 4 days by a navy ship.

449
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,000
Why?! Navy ships are that fast?

450
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,270
There's a current used exclusively
by the World Government.

451
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,320
Enies Lobby.

452
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Impel Down.

453
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,740
Navy Headquarters.

454
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,280
There's a giant whirlpool which
connects those three facilities.

455
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,320
When you open the Gate of Justice
at any of the three facilities,

456
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,630
the current runs inside
allowing you to enter.

457
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:49,260
That means if the gates aren't open,
you'd just keep drifting on the current.

458
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,680
Pirate ships would rather avoid the current by going a long way round.

459
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,000
What should I do?

460
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,880
What do you want to do?

461
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,590
Don't tell me that's your
brother's Vivre Card!

462
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,960
Oh, is it the sheet that moves
around that you care about so much?

463
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
That's a different one.

464
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,330
This is the one that Ace gave to me.

465
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,000
That's also known as a paper of life.

466
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,730
It tells you a direction in which the
person is and about their vital energy.

467
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,270
So, if it's that small, it means...

468
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,940
When I got it, it was ten times bigger.

469
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,720
Ace has his own adventure...

470
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,860
It's natural for a big brother to worry about...

471
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,080
his bungling kid brother.

472
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,260
Ace won't like me rescuing him
since he's stronger.

473
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,170
But...

474
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm sorry, everybody.

475
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,470
I'm gonna take a little side trip.

476
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,680
I wanna go and rescue Ace!

477
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:21,590
Do you have any idea how reckless it would be and how big this battle is going to be?

478
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,310
You'll be like an ant blown into a storm.

479
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,420
You can just be flicked away
without even having done anything.

480
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,990
I don't care what's gonna
happen! I just wanna go!

481
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,940
I can't just sit by calmly on the
sidelines and let this happen!

482
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,610
I see.

483
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,350
So you're going to rescue the most
infamous prisoner in the world now.

484
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,820
If there is a chance in a million,

485
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,590
you better go to the Great
Prison where he's being held.

486
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,170
When they move him to the
execution ground in Marinford,

487
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,930
the navy admirals and the Seven
Warlords will be keeping a close eye.

488
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,710
However, because your brother is now
the most important prisoner they have,

489
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,280
there is no doubt that they're guarding the
prison with the military's full strength.

490
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,120
So it's impossible to enter.

491
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,850
I care more about getting there in
time than what happens after.

492
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,280
I got to get there while Ace is there.

493
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,720
Just give me a big oar,
and I'll paddle myself...

494
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,680
Wait a second! You can't
get there on will alone.

495
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,430
This is a slim chance, too, but...

496
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,620
Snake Princess refuses to follow the order to
force the Seven Warlords to assemble.

497
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,910
If only she obeys the order,

498
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,920
we can take advantage of it
and let you on their ship.

499
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,430
Their ship? There's a navy ship here?!

500
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,890
Then I'm gonna go and ask her!

501
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,320
Amazon Lily
Kuja Castle

502
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,030
Granny Nyon!

503
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,140
What's wrong, Enishida? Why
are you in such a hurry?

504
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,580
Thank god. I was going to come get you.

505
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,770
What happened?

506
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,000
Well...

507
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,870
Snake Princess...

508
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,340
has come down with an unknown illness.

509
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,050
--She's sick?!
--Oh my god!

510
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,690
Big Sis! Hang in there!

511
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,820
Big Sis!

512
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,430
Oh, Granny Nyon!

513
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,690
You, wait outside for a while.

514
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,300
What?! But I have to hurry!

515
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,170
I know that!

516
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,200
I can't breathe.

517
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,520
The way she's clutching her chest,

518
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,660
I think there's something
wrong with her heart.

519
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,700
But I can't figure out what it is.

520
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,130
I've never seen symptoms like these, so
I don't know what to prescribe.

521
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,700
Snake Princess seems to be in a lot of pain.

522
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,410
She didn't eat a thing.

523
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,120
Tomorrow morning...

524
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,620
--Snake Princess!
--Granny Nyon, stop fooling around with her!

525
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,500
Of course!

526
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,030
I can't believe this!

527
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,930
What an untimely virus!

528
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,430
--A virus?
--Do you know what it is?

529
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,440
Granny Nyon... I can't breathe!

530
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,730
Am I... going to die?

531
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,480
Yes, you are.

532
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,220
--What're you saying?!
--Stop making stupid jokes, Granny Nyon!

533
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,150
The former empress died
from the same illness.

534
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,490
I heard the empress before
that died from this, too.

535
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:22,070
I caught it, too, but left this country and survived.

536
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,560
Snake Princess, Monkey D. Luffy is here with me.

537
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,070
Hey, Granny Nyon!

538
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,680
He wants to ask you a favor.
Can you at least listen to him?

539
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,710
--Big Sis is suffering!
--What are you thinking?!

540
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,020
She's standing!

541
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,670
Alright. I'd like to hear it.

542
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,690
How lucky he is, Monkey D. Luffy!

543
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,500
Will he move this mountain
that no one could move?!

544
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Did you want something? Luffy?

545
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,180
I gotta ask you something!

546
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,430
Are you alright?

547
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,520
No sickness can overtake me.

548
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:17,000
There's a Whitebeard pirate named Ace who's
waiting to be executed. He's my brother!

549
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
I want to rescue Ace!

550
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,790
But I heard a pirate ship
can't make it in time!

551
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:27,600
Can you board the navy ship and take me to Ace's prison?!

552
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,980
How self-centered can
you be? Straw Hat Luffy!

553
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,240
You know Big Sis's pain but you still
ask her to go to that abhorrent place?!

554
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,850
How cruel you are!

555
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,040
We showed you mercy and then you become arrogant!

556
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,360
This is why we hate men! Big Sis's
patience is wearing very thin!

557
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,070
Turn him to stone and
throw him over the edge!

558
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,760
So you want me to follow their order for
the Seven Warlords to convene.

559
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,120
--Big Sis!
--Kill him!

560
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,130
If you want me to...

561
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,360
I'll go anywhere!

562
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,780
Good! Thank you! This way I can
make it before the execution!

563
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,140
S-Snake Princess decided to
go to the World Government HQ!

564
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,770
What happened to her, Granny Nyon?!

565
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,100
The Snake Princess is
suffering from love sickness!

566
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,870
The former empresses died
from being burnt by love!

567
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,630
There is a saying around the East Blue:

568
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,510
"Love is always..."

569
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,400
"...a hurricane!"
