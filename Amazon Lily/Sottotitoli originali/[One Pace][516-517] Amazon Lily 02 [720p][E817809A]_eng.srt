Share the good times and laugh.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,340
There.

22
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,380
Thanks!

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,590
Hating frills...

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,220
Men really are strange creatures.

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,740
Well yeah I guess so.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,430
Thanks for taking it off!

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Well bye!

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,050
I'll never feel relaxed until I find my friends!

29
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,270
You certainly are hasty...

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,340
As long as the others are still alive like I am that's all that matters.

31
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,580
As long as they're alive...

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,000
I can keep fighting again and again!

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm gonna surpass all of those guys!

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,620
Alright! I'm gonna walk on my hands all the way to Sabaody Archipelago!

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
That'll make me stronger!

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,480
Could you give me a ship?

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,600
You really are hasty...

38
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,700
You don't have any ships?!

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,480
This is the Calm Belt?!

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,020
That's right.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,270
Pirate Empress











Boa Hancock

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,550
This maiden island is surrounded by a giant Sea King den known as the Calm Belt.

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,590
Which is why sailors never dare come near.

44
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,200
Castaways will sometimes miraculously drift here but most of the time only as corpses.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,030
But you said there's a pirate group here!

46
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,620
The Snake Princess's pirate ship Yuda is pulled by vicious poisonous sea snakes.

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,840
Sea Kings can't attack it.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,310
It's the only ship on Amazon Lily!

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Now what do I do?

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,360
There's no wind...

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,580
Should I build a raft and paddle all the way there?

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,880
That's ridiculous...

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,040
Okay! I'm gonna build a raft and paddle all the way there!

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,540
That's what you just thought up!

55
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,240
It's done!

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,360
That's terrible! It's already about to break!

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,770
I had no obligation to save you!

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,180
Are all men unable to swim even if they're pirates?

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,650
That was close!

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,430
Darn it!

61
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,720
If only Franky were here!

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
I dunno what to do!

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,460
I'm the one who doesn't know what to do!

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,210
You could've at least escaped to somewhere far away...

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,240
If we keep this up I'll only grow attached to you!

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,220
Whoa now! Stop!

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
What're you doing?!

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,180
Oh yeah! These arrows!

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,780
They were strong enough to destroy stone walls when I was being chased earlier!

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,500
They don't seem like special arrows though...

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,200
The arrows possess "Haki"!

73
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,880
Of course they're powerful!

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Haki?

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,480
What's that?!

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,720
There she is!

77
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Marguerite is all right!

78
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,360
Everyone!

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,260
The man is with her! Kill him!

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
Uh oh!

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,930
Halt!

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,050
Stop!

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,880
Marguerite! Are you alright?!

84
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
We need to hurry and finish the man off!

85
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,860
The Snake Princess has returned!

86
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,870
Calm Belt














The seas around
the Island of Women

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,760
You have real guts to lay anchor in the middle of monster-infested waters.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,220
Yes. We were attacked only moments ago in fact!

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,860
The Sea Prism Stone in this warship may conceal our presence,

90
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,420
but staying anchored here for so long is bound to attract attention visually.

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,880
It's not, easy but the agreement between the Kuja and the government

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,440
forbids us from getting any closer than three kilometers from your island.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,420
Consequently we're forced to wait in the middle of the monsters' den.

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,190
Have you heard?

95
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,700
They say the Kuja are specters that turn people to stone!

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,890
Get real!

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,480
Did you kill that Sea King?

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,800
Sea Kings are hardly rare in the Grand Line...

99
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,280
Impossible!

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,300
Not even cannons have an effect?!

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,010
That's...

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
The vice-admiral!

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,100
Allowing an entire warship to be food for a Sea King...

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,300
...would belittle the name of justice!

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,180
I have not come to hunt Sea Kings.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,920
I would like to finish my business here and leave these waters quickly.

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,850
It looks like you have some skill.

108
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,440
I was growing tired of waiting!

109
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,150
At last you've returned Kuja Pirates!

110
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,520
I am Vice-Admiral Momonga of Navy Headquarters!

111
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,980
Warlord of the Sea and Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

112
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,230
Show yourself! I've come for you!

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,600
So sorry but the Snake Princess isn't coming out.

114
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,060
She's sent many replies now!

115
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,340
That's men for you! Such unsophisticated creatures!

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,750
I haven't seen a live man in a long time!

117
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Pirates and merchants always escape by boat when they see the Kuja flag!

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
Stop. That's a crude laugh.

119
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,420
We have received her replies...

120
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,840
"I will follow your orders to convene at once."

121
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,500
But she shows no indication of coming whatsoever!

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
This morning's newspaper.

123
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,600
A place and date has been decided for the public execution of Portgas D. Ace,

124
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,580
2nd Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates!

125
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,060
There is no turning back now!

126
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,420
The World Government has issued strict orders

127
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,620
forcing the Seven Warlords of the Sea to assemble!

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,170
Refuse and the agreement is off!

129
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,820
Your title of Warlord of the Sea will be revoked!

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,680
Do you hear that, Boa Hancock?!

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,840
Who placed a kitten...

132
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,540
...in my path?!

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,140
M-My deepest apologies!

134
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,770
I'm the one responsible!

135
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,820
Be more careful.

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,790
Y-Yes!

137
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,300
S-Stop that!

138
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,820
So you've come out, Boa Hancock!

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,620
Don't let your guard down men!

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,310
That's the Pirate Empress?!

141
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,580
She's the definition of the most beautiful woman in the world!

142
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,430
Amazon Lily Empress
Captain of the Kuja Pirates












Warlord of the Sea –‘Empress’ Boa Hancock

143
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,800
{\an8}So you've finally come for me...

144
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,180
What meddlesome people.

145
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,110
Youngest of the Gorgon Sisters










Boa Marigold

146
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,100
{\an8}My recent replies were lies.

147
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,680
Second of the Gorgon Sisters










Boa Sandersonia

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,080
{\an8}I will not go to war!

149
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,200
But...

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,170
I want you to let me keep my title of Warlord of the Sea.

151
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,120
And...

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,650
I also want all of the cargo on your ship.

153
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,750
What nonsense is this?!

154
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,850
You're not a selfish little child!

155
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,160
Do you honestly think we'll accept such outrageous demands?!

156
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,500
Hurry and haul it over!

157
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,210
What a beautiful woman!

158
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,880
I'll give her anything!

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,960
Why are you hauling our cargo?!

160
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,200
Come to your senses!

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Oh no! I blindly listened to what she said!

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,940
Portgas D. Ace's public execution is in exactly one week from today!

163
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,940
Fire Fist Ace's life will be ended in the town square of Marineford, at the Navy Headquarters!

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,040
In other words Whitebeard will make a move within the next week.

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,120
Navy Headquarters, led by three admirals

166
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,400
is prepared to counter Whitebeard with full military force!

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,680
Will you lose the title of Warlord or accept the orders to assemble?!

168
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
Decide now!

169
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,460
Time is nearly up!

170
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,740
I like the title of Warlord.

171
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
I don't want it taken away.

172
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,140
But I hate the World Government.

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't want to obey its orders.

174
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,240
How does this sound?

175
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,860
The marines who came to get me...

176
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,260
Had a mysterious accident on the sea

177
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,380
and were wiped out when they all turned to stone?

178
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,560
She's planning to do something!

179
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,880
Don't let your guard down!

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,960
I've heard about this before!

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,280
A ship was attacked by the Kuja pirate ship...

182
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,300
And when it was discovered later only strange statues were found onboard!

183
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,260
S-Strange statues?!

184
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,610
I already told you!

185
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,640
Your childish selfishness will not be allowed!

186
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,820
Big Sis has a terrible personality.

187
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,280
But she gets everything she wants.

188
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,340
Yes.

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,760
There is a reason for that.

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you know why that is?

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,500
Because no matter what I do...

192
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Even if I kick a kitten...

193
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,420
Even if I pull your ears off...

194
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,440
Or even if I kill someone, everyone in the world would forgive me.

195
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,760
The reason for that is...

196
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes...

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Because I'm beautiful!

198
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,000
Because I'm beautiful...!

199
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,760
Because I'm beautiful...!

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,620
Snake Princess!

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,100
We'll let you do anything!

202
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,440
After all you're beautiful!

203
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,420
Stop that all of you!

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,900
For being charmed by me your guilty consciences...

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,380
...will turn your bodies solid!

206
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,500
Love Mellow! {No idea what to translate her attacks as, thoughts? Original was "Love-Love Beam"}

207
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,600
Hanco--!

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,520
I'd expect no less from a navy vice-admiral...

209
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,580
I see.

210
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,660
You used pain to block out the evil thoughts.

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,440
You've much experience indeed.

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,100
However...

213
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,240
I can't say the same about your men.

214
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,600
Fools...!

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,480
It looks like you're the only one left now.

216
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,700
One and zero are not the same!

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,820
We will now return to the peaceful Amazon Lily!

218
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Yes Snake Princess!

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,780
Boa Hancock!

220
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,740
I will wait here as long as I can!

221
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,480
I will not return empty-handed!

222
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,360
If you do not reappear in two days' time...

223
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
The agreement is off!

224
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
Do as you wish.

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
Open the gate!

226
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,490
The Snake Princess has returned!

227
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,300
Welcome back!

228
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,980
Welcome back Kuja Pirates!

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,700
Snake Princess!

230
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
Ran-sama!

231
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,260
Daisy-sama!

232
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,920
We had a big haul!

233
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,460
They're so cool!

234
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,260
I'm gonna join the pirates someday too!

235
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,860
It's the Gorgon Sisters!

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,000
Snake Princess! Snake Princess!

237
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,860
Welcome back.

238
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,840
Your Monkey Carriage is ready.

239
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,180
Has anything happened?

240
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,880
No. Nothing at all...

241
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,700
Iron ore gunpowder alcohol and crops from the north...

242
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,700
What a tremendous haul!

243
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,360
We plundered two merchant ships and one pirate ship.

244
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,580
The center sea people just offshore also gave us their cargo.

245
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,960
The Kuja Pirates truly are elite!

246
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,330
Ran. Any books at all?

247
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,280
Granny Nyon!

248
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,420
Let me think.

249
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,380
Oh! Those center sea people did give us a newspaper.

250
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,000
Here you are!

251
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,140
Amazon Lily


















Kuja Castle

252
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,380
Welcome back!

253
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,450
Welcome back Snake Princess.

254
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,980
Thank you for holding down the fort.

255
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
Enishida. What is this?

256
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh!

257
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,240
It's a clay model that children from the village worked hard to make for you!

258
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,740
They must have worked hard to paint it too.

259
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,140
The way they carefully carried it to the castle to prevent it from breaking was truly tender and innocent!

260
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,180
Oh I see.

261
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,940
So they made me...

262
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,560
...Out of mud and clay...

263
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,700
Snake Princess!

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,540
Don't bring such filthy things into the castle!

265
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,360
Throw it away at once and clean the floor.

266
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
Anyway Enishida...

267
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Y-Yes?

268
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
I didn't see any of our defense warriors there to greet us on our arrival...

269
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh, well actually...

270
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,450
A rather violent monkey appeared in the jungle and...

271
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,860
It was such a savage and crude beast that they all had to go after it...

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,440
A monkey?

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,220
Don't worry. They'll be back shortly.

274
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm truly sorry they weren't there to greet you.

275
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,490
Well no matter.

276
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,480
Would you like something to drink?

277
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,070
White sake.

278
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,970
I think I'll have some too.

279
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,230
Granny Nyon.

280
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,640
This is my room. Why are you here?

281
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,220
G-Granny Nyon!

282
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,600
How did you get in?!

283
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,960
I can get in any way I want.

284
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,060
Throw her out.

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,640
Wait Snake Princess!

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,880
You forgot "please"...

287
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,880
"Please."

288
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,620
Pardon me. Please wait Snake Princess.

289
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,900
The center sea people's ship is anchored off shore.

290
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,520
They've come here to get you have they not?

291
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,560
They've ordered you into active duty have they not?

292
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,320
That's right. An invitation to war.

293
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,920
Why aren't you going?! You must go!

294
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,100
If you go the agreement will be upheld!

295
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,680
Certainly someone with your abilities...

296
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,860
...won't meet an untimely fate!

297
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,770
But...

298
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,070
I'm scared!

299
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,420
She's almost like a puppy!

300
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,590
Wait this is no time for that!

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,720
Granny Nyon...

302
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,760
This land is currently protected by your title of Warlord of the Sea!

303
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,820
Up until recently this island was protected from outside enemies

304
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,940
by the great defense network that is the Calm Belt!

305
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,960
However now the center sea people are using new ship-crafting techniques

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,480
to come and go through these waters as they please.

307
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,300
The fact that you're a Warlord of the Sea is the only reason they won't set foot on this island

308
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,660
to put a stop to the Kuja's pirate ways.

309
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,020
The island is also home to the very young and the very old.

310
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,580
If you lose the title and we return to being a regular pirate nation

311
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,900
only tragedy will await us!

312
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,860
Are you sure you're not just afraid?

313
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,860
My life could end at any time now.

314
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,470
Look closely at this crystal ball!

315
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,670
Let us shed light on your future...

316
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,780
{\an8}"Go!"

317
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,590
Detestable!

318
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,610
Throw her out!

319
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,350
This instant!

320
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,180
Y-Yes! Right away!

321
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,010
Wait! Snake Princess!

322
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,720
Stop! What are you doing?!

323
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,680
I watched quietly
only for you to put on a pathetic act.

324
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,190
What are you trying to pull here?

325
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,760
Your era came to an end a long time ago...

326
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,430
You lost your place as Amazon Lily's empress three decades ago,

327
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,410
Gloriosa!

328
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,940
If my own selfishness should bring about the end of our kingdom, I would be forgiven for it...

329
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,420
The reason for that is

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,810
yes...

331
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,410
...because I'm beautiful!

332
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,260
There it is!

333
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,750
The Snake Princess's "Extreme Looking-Down Pose!"

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,600
You may have been the empress of this kingdom once,

335
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
and yet you abandoned the kingdom and set off to sea!

336
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,310
You Kuja traitor!

337
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,250
That's why I live quietly on
the edge of the village now!

338
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,920
Then you should continue
to live there quietly.

339
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,640
I will not have you interfering with me
the current empress!

340
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,650
Snake Princess!

341
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,460
Hey! Let go!

342
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,350
That said I can't help but admire your zeal.

343
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,650
You win.

344
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,350
You agree to what I said Snake Princess?

345
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,580
It really does pay to talk things through!

346
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,570
Thank you!

347
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,630
You'll go then?!

348
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,870
I lied. Don't get cocky!

349
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,720
Get out of my sight!

350
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,240
Curse you Snake Princess!

351
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,910
S-Snake Princess...

352
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,580
What have you done?! She's an old woman!

353
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,550
I don't know what came over me...

354
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,560
Yes! Yes! That sort of thing
happens to all of us!

355
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,010
Granny Nyon!

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,330
Aged as I may be I am still a Kuja warrior.

357
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,270
I have not grown decrepit!

358
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,210
The Snake Princess is about to bathe!

359
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,600
Leave the castle premises immediately!

360
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,220
Come on! Let's hurry!

361
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,970
I-I just started eating!

362
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,590
Hurry outside!

363
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,690
It's time for their bath!

364
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,030
Get ready!

365
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,530
The people in the castle are coming
so it's about to get packed in here!

366
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,710
{\an8}Bath

367
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,850
For the next several hours

368
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,710
entrance into the castle
is strictly forbidden!

369
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,720
Say...

370
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,400
Why does everyone make such a big deal when the Snake Princess takes a bath?

371
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
How old are you now?

372
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,160
Eight.

373
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,750
Then I'll tell you.

374
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
The Gorgon Sisters' secret?!

375
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,330
That's right.

376
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,040
Gorgon was the name of a monster
that once lived in the center ocean.

377
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,200
Anyone who looked at this terrifying
monster would instantly turn to stone.

378
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,210
At the end of an adventure
the Snake Princess and her sisters

379
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,510
managed to slay the Gorgon monster.

380
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,760
But when the monster uttered its death howls

381
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,640
it placed a horrible curse
on the three warriors.

382
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,130
The monster's large eyes
were etched onto their backs

383
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,440
and everyone nearby who's lured in
by their charm and looks at them

384
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,030
is turned to stone and killed.

385
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,680
The Gorgon Sisters never remove
their clothes in front of people.

386
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,030
And when they bathe

387
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,260
they always post guards
like this to keep people away.

388
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,030
Island of Women, Jungle

389
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,490
Where did he run to?!

390
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,030
He went up the craggy mountain!

391
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,880
Don't tell me he went back into the village?!

392
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,770
He wanted a ship!

393
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,650
What?!

394
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,150
Now then, what now?

395
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll get spotted again if I just sit here...

396
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,070
She did mention this island
has a pirate ship...

397
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,450
If I can just borrow it somehow...

398
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,100
No wait. Nami's not here.

399
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,210
I'll end up drifting around
if I go all by myself.

400
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,860
Oh I know!

401
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,940
Asking for a ride on the
ship is the best way!

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,340
I'll ask if they'll take me to
Sabaody Archipelago!

403
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,550
Which means...

404
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,390
I'll have to talk to someone important

405
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,720
and since important people
live in tall buildings...

406
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm thinking so hard I might get a fever!

407
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,860
Okay! I'll just go into
a tall building first!

408
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,960
Hurry to the village!

409
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,750
The Snake Princess has
probably already returned!

410
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,550
If she finds the man
things will turn serious!

411
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,240
It's brittle!

412
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,470
What was that?!

413
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,720
The castle tower's roof collapsed!

414
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,400
What's happening?!

415
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,180
The Snake Princess is taking a bath in there!

416
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,350
More water?!

417
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,190
Ouch it's hot! Wait this is bathwater!

418
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,810
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna drown!

419
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,830
My feet are on the ground. I'm safe!

420
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,940
Is this a bath?

421
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,210
A man!?

422
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,350
Hey...

423
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,070
That thing on your back...

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,590
It seems familiar somehow...

425
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,530
You saw it?!
