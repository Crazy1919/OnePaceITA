You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

Sabaody Archipelago
Grove #41

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,960
Duval-sama.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,980
What's taking Young Master Straw Hat
and the others so long?

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,630
Maybe they're busy with
the people chasing â€˜em?

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,170
I heard the port's in a real uproar!

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,000
Then that's all the more
reason to stay sharp!

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,650
We don't want any idiots showing up
and taking off with this ship!

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,430
Guard it well until the
coating craftsman arrives!

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,030
Rosy Life Riders!

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,050
Yes Duva-some!

Grove #1
Auction House

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,410
You still haven't caught them?!

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,410
Admiral Kizaru is currently pursuing them

34
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,140
so it should only be a matter of time!

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,260
Please have patience!

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,270
You pathetic dimwitted dogs!

37
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,870
Not only did they do this
to my father and brother...

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,140
but they also let all of our slaves escape!

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,940
What do they take the blood
of this world's Creators for?!

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,240
When I get my hands on them...

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm going to put them through
a living hell so horrible...

42
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,950
that they'll crawl on the ground
and beg for forgiveness!

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,740
Grove #13
Shakki's Rip-off Bar

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm suddenly feeling uneasy.

45
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,120
I hope Luffy-chin and the others are okay...

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
What's with you Camie?!

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,180
Don't say worrisome stuff like that!

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,570
But...

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,470
They're strong.
There's nothing to worry about Camie...

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,190
I hope you're right...

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,740
They're up against a navy admiral.

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,010
Not even Monkey-chan's group
stands a chance strength-wise.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,850
The seas ahead will be rough.

54
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,320
Giant waves they've never
seen before are coming.

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,630
They mustn't let these waves do them in.

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,210
There. Can you hear it?

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,400
Little by little the tide of
the times is beginning to change.

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,340
Adventure on the Island of Women

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,000
Meanwhile, Monkey D. Luffy
after being ejected

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,050
from Sabaody Archipelago
by Bartholomew Kuma.

61
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,330
Damn it!

62
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,630
Zoro! Nami!

63
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,860
Usopp! Sanji! Chopper!

64
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,750
Robin! Franky! Brook!

65
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Where did you send all my friends?!

66
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,870
Where did you guys disappear to?!

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,690
That bear-like Warlord
of the Sea is gonna pay!

68
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,880
How far am I gonna fly anyway?!

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,260
Perhaps, instead of disappearing, they were all sent flying like this too?

70
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,090
I'm dead if I fall into the ocean...

71
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,830
I'm hungry too...

72
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,040
But... I'm feeling sleepy...

73
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,450
I'm alive...

74
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,470
I don't think me being rubber
is why I'm still alive...

75
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,790
But what's this bear paw-looking thing?

76
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,650
I just hope the others
were saved the same way...

77
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,900
Anyway, I gotta get back!

78
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,040
Where is this place...

79
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,410
...and which way is Sabaody Archipelago?!

80
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,760
Oh yeah!

81
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,530
I have my Vivre Card!

82
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,000
Good thing we all got one!

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Alright! I gotta go back!
I gotta get back there!

84
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,460
I'm sure I'll see everyone again!

85
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,770
That way, huh?

86
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,180
Everyone focus on escaping!

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,300
As we are now we can't beat these guys!

88
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,020
Just get out of here!

89
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,310
You can think things over after you're safe!

90
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,290
Go!

91
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,890
What's wrong with me?!

92
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,160
I couldn't save even one of my friends...!

93
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,790
Ouch!

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,870
Actually, that doesn't hurt.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,570
but oh there's something in the way...

96
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,470
Still...

97
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,600
...the card is pointing this way...

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,910
Alright!

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,080
Giant Pistol!

100
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,440
N-No good...

101
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm out of strength...

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,450
Sanji! Food!

103
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,620
Oh wait he's not here...

104
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,360
{\an8}"Stomach rumble"

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,030
{\an8}"Stomach rumble"
"Stomach rumble"
"Stomach rumble"

106
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,600
Thanks for the food!

107
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,460
This brings back memories...

108
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,510
Back when Grandpa would throw me
into the jungle when I was a kid!

109
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,210
I don't wanna remember that.

110
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,930
Aren't these Laughing Mushrooms?

111
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,540
Yeah! This is perfect for times like this!

112
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,670
Now I'm having fun!

113
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,370
Even though I'm all alone!

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,900
There are some weird ones over here too!

115
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,890
Now I'm feeling mad!

116
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,280
Laughing Mushrooms! Laughing Mushrooms!

117
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh! There are weird mushrooms here too!

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,390
Crying Mushrooms!

119
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,540
Marguerite! Marguerite!

120
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,750
Over here!

121
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,880
What is it Sweetpea?

122
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,130
What do you make of this?

123
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,920
Of what?

124
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,440
What do you suppose this is?

125
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,630
Wh-What the...?! This is a person!

126
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,060
Is it someone from the village?

127
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,870
I don't know.

128
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,150
There are so many mushrooms
growing out of her body...

129
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,160
This is it.

130
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
Look! She ate this mushroom!

131
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,570
A Parasite Mushroom.

132
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,320
When eaten mushrooms
grow out of your body!

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,400
This is bad!

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,810
If we don't do something the mushrooms
will sap away her vitality and kill her!

135
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,410
So it's a race against time!

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,410
Aphelandra! Carry her to the village!

137
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,330
Okay!

138
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,350
To the village it is!

139
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,530
Let's hurry!

140
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,590
We have an urgent patient!

141
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,180
Hey! Down in front! I can't see!

142
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,610
What happened to her?!
She's covered in mushrooms!

143
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,350
Have you seen her in the village before?

144
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,870
No never...

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,950
Hey who is she?

146
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,340
The mushrooms are covering her face...

147
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,060
Where do you think she came from?

148
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,070
Is she even alive?

149
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,500
She ate a Parasite Mushroom.

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,350
What should we do Belladonna?

151
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,880
They come off when pulled
so pull them out. All of them.

152
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,820
They come off?

153
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,300
They really do!

154
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,860
But some of the roots are left behind!

155
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,370
I'll get rid of them afterward
so don't worry about the roots.

156
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,710
You've certainly brought
a strange one home Marguerite.

157
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,450
Ouch! Hot! Hot!

158
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,930
Hold on Belladonna! What are you doing?!

159
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,210
This is the only way to keep
them from growing back.

160
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,560
But isn't that a little excessive?

161
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,380
She passed out again!

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,960
Still, she was covered in injuries
before she was covered in mushrooms.

163
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Really?

164
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,970
They seem like marks
from a tremendous battle.

165
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,190
We'll need to treat her wounds too.

166
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,450
I hate to ask Marguerite

167
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,330
but could you go wash her off in the river?

168
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,310
O-Okay! Sure!

169
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,080
It sounds like she's not from
this village after all Sweetpea.

170
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,190
Yeah...

171
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,960
Huh? Look here!

172
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,900
What's wrong?

173
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,660
There's still a mushroom
between her legs that we missed!

174
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,600
There's one left!

175
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,320
But doesn't this one seem
different from the others?

176
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,010
It's oddly shaped!

177
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,390
Alright!

178
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,040
It won't come off! How come?!

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,020
It's stretching!

180
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,250
Hey what's going on? What happened?

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,580
She says it stretches...

182
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
That's enough gawking all of you!

183
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,450
This isn't a freak show!

184
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,170
You're watching too you know!

185
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,910
Look! There seems to be a problem!

186
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,540
Still she's not very well-endowed.

187
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,050
She even seems sort of rugged.

188
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,810
It's no use.

189
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,010
What's this? What's this?

190
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,620
What's going on?

191
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,520
Oh Granny Nyon!

192
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,250
There's a mushroom growing
on this girl that won't come off!

193
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,770
Now now. Wait. Just who is this?

194
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,300
Oh my!

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,930
Th-This person...

196
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
...is a m-m-man!

197
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,350
Th-This is a m-man?!

198
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,110
I've never seen one before!

199
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,990
Here sits the maiden island of Amazon Lily

200
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:57,030
{\an8}"Kuja"

201
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,030
inhabited by the tribe of
female warriors known as the Kuja.

202
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,870
May you never dream of it or step foot on it

203
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,760
should you still value your life.

204
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:29,720
Maiden Island â€“ Amazon Lily

205
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,730
{\an8}This is the all-female land of Amazon Lily.

206
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,890
On occasion women will leave
the island and return with child

207
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,320
but oddly enough
they only give birth to girls.

208
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,180
{\an8}"Kuja"

209
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,450
Inside a tall mountain surrounded
by thick jungle is a large hole

210
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,270
and inside it a fortress-like village
was built and a country created.

211
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,540
I found it!

212
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,610
Step right up! We have
Sea King meat on hand today!

213
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,460
It looks good!

214
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,170
It'll make your skin nice and smooth too!

215
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,310
How about some fresh-picked
fruit from the jungle?!

216
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,280
All the wage-earning and manual labor
is done by women too of course.

217
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,510
I brought it!

218
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,470
Thanks! Just set it right there!

219
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,880
Sure thing!

220
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,740
Raised from birth as warriors

221
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,170
they truly are burly and large-hearted

222
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,660
but they also have an air of
elegance about them as well.

223
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,330
There is no place here
for greedy foolish men at all.

224
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,850
{\an8}"Fighting"

225
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,850
And more than anything the
women of this island are strong.

226
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,150
Here are today's odds!

227
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,720
1000 Gol on Poppy!

228
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
1500 on Pansy!

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,470
In this land the strong are beautiful.

230
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,420
Should a man ever approach this country

231
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,590
eradication is all that awaits him.

232
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,840
{\an8}"Prison"

233
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,970
The man's awake!

234
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,280
Let me see! Let me see!

235
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,210
I want to see too!

236
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,610
He's moving around!

237
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,260
Look! He has no breasts at all!

238
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,420
What a weird rugged creature!

239
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,520
He looks so weak with his
shaggy hair and scrawny body!

240
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,170
He slept for quite a long time...

241
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,440
But I heard he ate meals while asleep!

242
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,890
Did you know that?

243
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,750
What do men usually eat anyway? Raw meat?

244
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,150
I get the feeling he'll eat anything...

245
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,930
What's going on?

246
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,480
--What's all the noise?
--Oh! He can talk!

247
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,960
Where am I?

248
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,700
What was I doing again?

249
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,660
Oh yeah!

250
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,320
Everyone was separated
at Sabaody Archipelago!

251
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,330
Everyone! Shh! He's saying something!

252
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,400
I remember eating mushrooms
but everything after--

253
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,800
My hat's gone!

254
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,740
There it is!

255
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,750
Give it back you jerk!

256
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,040
His arm stretched!

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,850
What kind of body does he have?!

258
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,480
That's a relief!

259
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,550
M-M-Men can stretch their arms!

260
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,620
How shocking! Notes! Notes!

261
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,720
This is most intriguing!

262
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,340
Say! What's your name?

263
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,860
I'm Luffy.

264
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,030
I'm naked!

265
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,340
You're slow!

266
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,950
I feel breezy!

267
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,800
Do you know where my clothes are?

268
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,340
Men are slow and want to conceal
their heads before their bodies!

269
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,630
Umm before you get dressed umm...!

270
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,720
What's inside that bag
sewn between your legs?

271
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,950
Bag?

272
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,660
Wait you don't know what these are?

273
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,110
What a weirdo! These are balls!

274
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,100
Balls?

275
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,820
What are balls?

276
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,930
They're the family jewels of course!

277
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,150
Gorgeous!

278
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,250
Family jewels!

279
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,610
Could you take your jewels out
and let us see them?

280
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,640
Hell no!

281
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,560
Are you trying to kill me?! You idiot!

282
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,560
Here are your clothes then!

283
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,730
Yours were all torn up

284
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,730
so I made new ones with the same design!

285
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh?! That's great!

286
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,500
Thanks! I don't even know who you are!

287
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,250
What did you...?

288
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,530
I added sexy flower frills too!

289
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,600
Outdoor outfits are all about the frills!

290
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
Great job Marguerite!

291
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,550
He seems so happy he's shaking!

292
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't be stupid!

293
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm a man you know!

294
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,150
Prepare to attack!

295
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,390
What?!

296
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,420
What a vicious temper!
Is that your true nature?!

297
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,440
Shamelessly yelling without any care
for the fact that we saved his life...

298
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,370
What a savage temperament!

299
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,800
His words and actions haven't shown
a shred of elegance whatsoever!

300
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,030
His kind really is incompatible
with us after all!

301
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,810
Even so Kikyo!

302
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,610
He hasn't done much!
I'd feel sorry for killing him!

303
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,990
Wait! Hold on!

304
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,780
You saved my life?!

305
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,630
What happened?! Tell me!

306
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,050
These girls saved you after you ate
a lethal mushroom and collapsed.

307
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,900
Oh really?! Thank you!

308
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,180
Sorry for complaining about the clothes!

309
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
Just don't shoot me!

310
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,380
Your apologies and excuses mean nothing!

311
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,710
This is the woman empire of Amazon Lily!

312
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,500
Men are forbidden!

313
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,470
That has been the absolute
rule here for centuries!

314
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,410
Never in history has it been broken!

315
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,890
Woman empire?!

316
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,850
Now that you've regained consciousness

317
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,950
we have no sympathy for you!

318
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,680
Yeah! Now that I look closer
it's nothing but women!

319
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,500
What a weird country!

320
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,470
We'll put an end to that
disdainful way of talking as well!

321
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,750
Hey!

322
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,700
Aphelandra!

323
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,620
When the Snake Princess returns

324
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,390
she will absolutely disapprove
of this situation!

325
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,390
You'll also be charged with the crime
of bringing a man into the village!

326
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,450
Marguerite.

327
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,800
Sweetpea.

328
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,210
Aphelandra.

329
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,760
This is for your sake!

330
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,640
It is best that we cover up this incident!

331
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,960
Wait! Let me go!

332
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,980
I have to get to the place
my friends and I agreed on!

333
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,470
Shoot!

334
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,320
He broke through the roof!

335
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,850
Don't let him escape!

336
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,070
He's nimbler than he looks!

337
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,230
Aphelandra!

338
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,110
Right!

339
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,840
Sorry for saving you and then doing this!

340
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,400
He fell!

341
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,450
Now he's bouncing!

342
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,430
Hmm now what do I do?

343
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,490
Oh right! My Vivre Card!

344
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,200
I left the old guy's piece
of paper in my other pants!

345
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,140
There she is! That's her!

346
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,890
I can't talk here!

347
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,780
Sorry! There's something I wanna ask you!

348
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,320
Let go! Help!

349
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,620
Oh no! Marguerite's been abducted!

350
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,690
Rubber Balloon!

351
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,360
Hey. You alright?

352
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,720
Stay away!

353
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,450
You... turned fat just now didn't you?!

354
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,620
You must be crazy to jump from way up there!

355
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,330
I was ready to die!

356
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,360
It's a miracle we're still alive!

357
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,510
Really?

358
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,780
Stay away!

359
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,170
I've heard that you men have a virus!

360
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,970
Do all men suddenly grow fat?!

361
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,410
I don't have any kind of virus

362
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,360
and it'll be a pain to explain, so let's just say all men suddenly grow fat.

363
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,840
Anyway was there something
in my torn-up pants pockets?

364
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,950
Is this it?

365
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,900
This is it! This is it! What a relief!

366
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,960
I wouldn't know what to do without this!

367
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,550
Thanks for holding onto it!

368
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,760
L-Let go!

369
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,300
Oh what a relief!

370
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,840
There was something written
on it so I figured...

371
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,290
Here look!

372
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,930
How odd! It looks like it's moving!

373
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,590
A bunch of stuff happened

374
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,500
and all my friends went flying
through the sky in different directions.

375
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,780
But thanks to these pieces of paper

376
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,840
we can all get together again!

377
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,780
They're all tough you see!

378
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,110
Oh I've been thanking you non-stop!

379
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,890
Is there anything I can do for you?

380
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,040
Could you take out your family
jewels so I can see them then?!

381
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,190
I told you they don't come off!

382
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,200
Put the sword away!

383
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,700
Who are these "friends" of yours?!

384
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,310
Oh I'm a pirate!

385
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,070
Do you know what a pirate is?

386
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,290
You're a pirate?

387
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,780
This land's empress is a pirate too.

388
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,230
Really?

389
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,280
Then she has a women-only pirate group?

390
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,750
Are they strong?

391
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,450
That's a foolish question!

392
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,430
The most elite warriors of this land
ride aboard her pirate ship!

393
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,910
They're very strong!

394
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,400
Everyone here looks up to the Snake Princess!

395
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,120
She's strong noble and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

396
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,270
The Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

397
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,250
This land is closely protected
by her and her two sisters!

398
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,690
Oh no! The Snake Princess's ship is nearby!

399
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,920
This is bad!

400
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,490
We need to end the
incident with the man quickly!

401
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,210
Kikyo...

402
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,140
It looks like the man jumped
into the jungle after all!

403
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,980
Warriors! To the jungle!

404
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,950
Kill the man and rescue Marguerite!

405
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,470
The Snake Princess has returned!
