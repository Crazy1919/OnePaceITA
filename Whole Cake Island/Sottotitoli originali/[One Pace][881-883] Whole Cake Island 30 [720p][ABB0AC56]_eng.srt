1611
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,260
Wave Room

1612
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,410
Is this Heaven? It's beautiful...

1613
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,140
What do you mean you're done for?!
What's happening over there?!

1614
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,070
Hey, guys!

1615
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,670
If we get caught in that wave, we'll be done for!

1616
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,220
Oh right! We have the Coup de Burst!

1617
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,490
We can't use it!
We don't have enough cola!

1618
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,600
Pedro, I'm sorry!
You sacrificed yourself to save us, but...

1619
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,880
Everyone, listen!

1620
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,850
My cake!

1621
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,520
Wait! Wait, wait!

1622
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,230
Wait a minute, Mama!

1623
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,710
If you do that,
the cake will sink into the sea, too!

1624
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,090
Mama!

1625
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,850
Hurry up!

1626
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,730
Okay!

1627
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,260
D-Does this look okay, Jinbe-san?!

1628
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes, that's fine!

1629
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,060
But it's too reckless! You're trying to handle a ship's sails all on your own!

1630
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,360
Nami! How is the wind?!

1631
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,740
A strong wind is coming from the south!

1632
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,840
All right!

1633
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,070
What are you going to do, Jinbe?!

1634
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm gonna tack this ship as fast as I can!

1635
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
What?!

1636
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,550
Are you joking?! Why do you want to turn the ship?!

1637
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,270
We're going to enter the Green Room!

1638
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,510
Here we go! Here we go!

1639
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,870
The Green Room?! What's that?!

1640
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,700
Why are we heading towards the wave, Jinbe?!

1641
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,960
I see! This Green Room you're talking about must be Heaven!

1642
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,410
Doctor! I'll be heading over to your side soon!

1643
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,300
It's over! This is impossible! We aren't surfing, you know!

1644
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,250
Pedro!

1645
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,010
Hold on tight to the ship!

1646
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,390
Splash!

1647
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,780
What's wrong?! What happened?!

1648
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,020
Hey, can you hear me?!

1649
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,290
Somebody! Say something!

1650
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,530
Huh?

1651
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,020
Is this Heaven? It's beautiful...

1652
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,340
This is a good ship!

1653
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,340
The Green Room is found within surging waves. It is a room of waves that forms for a brief moment.

1654
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,960
It has always been the perfect playground for Fishman children!

1655
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,770
Then, this place is...

1656
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,730
Inside the wave?!

1657
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,010
We're gonna sail through it! Hang on!

1658
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,830
We have a good ship... and a good navigator!

1659
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,680
With a good helmsman... this ship will be invincible!

1660
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,260
Amazing! 
He's controlling a sloop like it's part of his own body!

1661
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,650
I've never seen such a helmsman before!

1662
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,970
You're amazing, Jinbe!

1663
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,930
So we're not gonna die?!

1664
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,130
Wedding...

1665
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,020
Oh well...
It serves you weaklings right!

1666
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,040
Lick!

1667
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
This is Perospero.

1668
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
Hey, Katakuri.

1669
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,520
We took care of all of them!

1670
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,920
What?!

1671
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,930
Hey, Nami! Brook! Carrot!

1672
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,510
Oh dear!

1673
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,890
We were just about to invade the ship!

1674
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,930
The plan's canceled, guys!

1675
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,450
It seems like the ship has already
sunk into the sea.

1676
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,400
But it's strange, Big Sis.

1677
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,960
The other side of the mirror
doesn't look like it's underwater.

1678
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,310
Look!

1679
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,620
No way!

1680
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,590
But, just to make sure, shoot one more time.

1681
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,830
Wow! The mirror! Big Sis, it suddenly broke!

1682
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,770
What? What? What's going on?!

1683
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,870
Nami-san! Why did you break the mirror?!

1684
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,590
Luffy-san can't come back to the ship without it!

1685
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,910
Let me focus just on this guy!

1686
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,810
Just break them all!
Every single mirror on this ship!

1687
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,040
But...

1688
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,980
Do you want to get in Luffy's way?!

1689
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,990
These are our captain's orders! Hurry up!

1690
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,590
There are still some mirrors!

1691
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,460
I found one, Joscar!

1692
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,220
I found it, too, Mascar!

1693
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,630
Let's do it, Joscar!

1694
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,600
Let's do it, Mascar!

1695
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,940
Make sure to find all the mirrors!

1696
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,610
Shoot!

1697
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,880
What?!

1698
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,890
What's going on?!

1699
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
This is the last one!

1700
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,260
Are those guys alive?

1701
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,750
Big Bro Peros said they took care of them...

1702
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,510
I guess the ship sank and the mirrors were
shattered by the water pressure, Joscar!

1703
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,700
Yeah, I guess that's it, Mascar!

1704
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,680
Something seems off about this...

1705
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,280
Hey, Luffy!

1706
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,390
Are you all right?!

1707
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,460
Chopper!

1708
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,700
I have something to tell you, so get away from the enemies!

1709
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,400
Okay!

1710
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,810
Are you guys all right?!

1711
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,170
Hey! Straw Hat is running away!

1712
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,740
What happened?!
The candy guy said the Sunny sank!

1713
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,530
We thought we were going to sink, too!
But Jinbe did something amazing!

1714
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,970
We're all fine, Luffy!

1715
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,220
Luffy-san!
We broke all the mirrors on the ship!

1716
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,180
I see! Good job!

1717
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,740
With this, our enemies won't be able to come here, but you won't be able to come back either!

1718
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,440
Yeah, that's okay! I'll figure something...

1719
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,570
No you won't!
You don't even have a plan!

1720
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,320
Listen carefully, Luffy!

1721
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,620
Sanji-kun is baking the cake
on Cacao Island right now!

1722
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,940
That's where we're heading!

1723
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,040
At the earliest, we'll arrive in 10 hours!

1724
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,410
At around 1 A.M!

1725
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,750
So after you beat that guy up...

1726
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,380
search for a mirror that leads to Cacao Island!
We'll meet you there!

1727
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,540
Damn! I can't get it off!

1728
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Is something wrong, Luffy?

1729
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,570
Can you hear me?

1730
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,750
Luffy!

1731
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,960
Yeah!

1732
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,900
Hey! Stay focused!

1733
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,200
Maybe he's in trouble!

1734
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,330
Please respond!

1735
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,820
Luffy!

1736
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,370
Are you okay, Luffy?!

1737
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,580
Luffy-san!

1738
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,320
Willow Mochi!

1739
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,210
Luffy?

1740
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,390
You're fine, right, Luffy-san?!

1741
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,620
What's the matter, Luffy?!

1742
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,980
Hurry up and get there, guys!

1743
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,870
I'll probably be there soon...
and I'll be tired of waiting!

1744
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,540
Yeah!

1745
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,870
See you later, guys!

1746
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,690
Yeah!

1747
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,230
Our pursuers will be here soon!
Let's keep an eye out!

1748
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
Roger!

1749
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,140
Let's go to the observation deck, Carrot!

1750
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,430
Okay, Chobro!

1751
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,710
Next, you'll say...

1752
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,630
"I don't plan on dying in a place like this."

1753
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,480
Are those really your last words?

1754
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,540
I don't plan on dying in a place like this!

1755
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,500
No one dies because they want to.

1756
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,920
Most people...

1757
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,120
die against their will.

1758
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,140
He's right!

1759
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Why don't you drop dead already, Straw Hat?!

1760
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,440
Branch!

1761
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,370
The name's Brûlée!

1762
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,950
Don't think that you can beat him
with just your spirit, brat!

1763
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,870
Big Brother Katakuri isn't just an undefeated man!

1764
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:33,520
He's a superhuman whose back has never once touched the ground since he was born!

1765
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,000
Stop it, Brûlée!

1766
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,390
The legend goes like this: The moment he was born, he stood up on his feet...

1767
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,090
and sat on a chair to sleep on it.

1768
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:49,060
He's never laid down in his life!
He's a man who scorns even the ground!

1769
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,910
He's always dignified...

1770
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,190
calm, and strong!

1771
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,700
He's the perfect human!

1772
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,260
That's our Big Brother, Katakuri!

1773
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,730
He's the Charlotte Family's greatest creation!

1774
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,080
So a small fry like you challenging him to a duel...

1775
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,300
is just absurd!

1776
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,810
Shut up! Go away!

1777
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,130
What are you trying to do... to my little sister?!

1778
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,320
Big Brother!

1779
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,280
Mochi Thrust!

1780
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,470
Ouch...

1781
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,730
That was close!

1782
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,710
I almost got crushed!

1783
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,180
The name of this spear is Mole!

1784
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,440
Your arms... or your legs?
Which body part do you want removed first?

1785
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,570
I'll sever them for you!

1786
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,650
Please start with his head, Big Bro!

1787
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,360
Shut up, you fool!

1788
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,950
Rubber-Rubber...

1789
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,920
Giant Rifle!

1790
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,690
I was listening!

1791
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,630
Straw Hat!

1792
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,410
I know about your meeting place.

1793
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,320
Do you wanna play with a wave again, Mama?

1794
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,530
At Sea - Within the Territory

1795
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,120
Come on! Let's do it!

1796
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,530
Mama, are you listening?

1797
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,120
What?! Their ship hasn't sunk yet?!

1798
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,750
Are you sure, Brûlée?!

1799
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,490
Yes, I heard their voices!

1800
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,720
But my candy monster swallowed them with a giant wave!

1801
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,240
How did they escape?!

1802
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,340
I don't know how they did it!

1803
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,500
But they're definitely still alive! They'll be showing up on Cacao Island sometime tonight.

1804
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,220
That is what they promised Straw Hat Luffy.
There's no mistake!

1805
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,350
What they don't know is...

1806
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,030
that it's our final destination, too!

1807
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,380
Mama! The cake you desire is at Chocolat Town on Cacao Island!

1808
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,320
Aren't you excited?

1809
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,770
I lied to her out of desperation,

1810
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,370
but if I take Mama there like this,
I can cover up my lie!

1811
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:48,220
Pudding is baking the cake on Cacao Island!

1812
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,370
No matter what happens, everything will be settled!

1813
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,560
Wedding cake!

1814
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,150
Mama, it's that way, huh?!

1815
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,660
Wait a sec! That's Nuts Island!

1816
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,510
Hey, hey, what are you doing?!

1817
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,630
Mama! Their ship didn't go that way!
The cake is on Cacao Island!

1818
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,540
Wedding...

1819
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,420
No, Mama! Stop!

1820
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,420
cake!

1821
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,270
Don't go that way!

1822
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,860
Mirro-world

1823
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,980
He never learns!

1824
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,070
You bastard!

1825
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,150
Rubber-Rubber...

1826
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,460
Grizzly Corkscrew Magnum!

1827
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,140
Damn!

1828
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,520
He's always able to hit me when I dodge!

1829
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,540
That tires me out even more!

1830
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,750
It's the same for me.

1831
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,450
Nobody has ever dodged my attacks like you have.

1832
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,210
It's stressful!

1833
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,270
You tried to take Mole away from me...

1834
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,900
Damn! I almost got it!

1835
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,910
Flowing Mochi!

1836
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,640
Wh-What the?!

1837
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,270
The ground became mochi!

1838
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,360
This is just like what Doflamingo did!

1839
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,410
Listen up, fledgling!

1840
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:20,510
Devil Fruit abilities have yet another stage to
them, called "Awakening"!

1841
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,510
Of course my ability is awakened.

1842
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,960
Oh, no!

1843
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,730
It's no use.

1844
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,010
With your elasticity and viscosity ,
you can't move anymore.

1845
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,680
Should I just chop you up?

1846
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,320
Or should I let you suffocate in the mochi?

1847
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,560
How would you like to die?

1848
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,840
I'm not gonna die!

1849
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,750
Gear Fourth?

1850
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,710
How interesting.

1851
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,590
Whole Cake Island - Sweet City

1852
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,430
How odd...

1853
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,820
We haven't gotten a report on the location of the Straw Hats' ship.

1854
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,640
What are the Territorial Sea Slugs doing?!

1855
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,060
Shut up, Pekoms!

1856
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,350
Just stop crying already!

1857
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,530
Big Bro Pedro!

1858
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,070
I feel pity for him...

1859
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,000
It's hard to believe that your childhood friend...

1860
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,750
and big brother chose to die by suicide bombing-bon...

1861
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,000
He was our enemy!

1862
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,470
Bon...

1863
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,600
It's pointless to die here!
The dawn of the world is coming!

1864
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,010
I must go back to my country!

1865
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,430
This will break all of your-gara
magic spells, right?

1866
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,350
Bombs?!

1867
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,520
Farewell.

1868
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,530
It was a shock to me as well-amour...

1869
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:23,410
Five years ago, I witnessed Pedro begging for his life, tears and all-bon.

1870
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:29,370
And that same man sacrificed his life to allow them to sail away!

1871
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,630
Who cares?

1872
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,050
Big Bro...

1873
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:43,770
We may still be underestimating
Straw Hat Luffy-issant!

1874
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,260
What's your point?

1875
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,510
My point is that we should take this more seriously-bon!

1876
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,460
Mama will never be taken out by a brat like him!

1877
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,040
Are you saying that Straw Hat Luffy is that much weaker than her?

1878
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,160
Of course!
She's in a different class as a pirate!

1879
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,750
Can you say the same even while looking at Mama's fallen castle?!

1880
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,750
That happened by chance!

1881
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,350
An accident you say?! And are the Sea Slugs neglecting their security duties by chance as well?!

1882
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,080
What?! Are you telling me that all of this is part of their plan as well?!

1883
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,900
At the very least,

1884
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,730
since the Straw Hats arrived, unexpected incidents have occurred one after the other-jour!

1885
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,410
An arrogant ruler will have the rug pulled out from under them.

1886
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,740
To prevent the one in a million chance that Mama's name is tarnished...

1887
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,880
A powerful fleet should be sent to the border of our territory as the final line of defence-amour!

1888
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,110
Ring, ring, ring... ring,
ring, ring... Clank.

1889
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,300
Mont d'Or-sama.

1890
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,060
What?

1891
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,690
There's a call from Custard-sama on the Transponder Snail.

1892
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,790
Custard was chasing after Bege, wasn't she?

1893
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,620
This is Mont d'Or. Did you take care of Bege?

1894
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
Well...

1895
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,680
We lost track of his ship.

1896
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,870
What?!

1897
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,840
The Territorial Sea Slugs aren't sending us
the location of the ship!

1898
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
Huh?! It's not just us?!

1899
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,520
What?!

1900
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,760
We haven't gotten the location
of the Straw Hats, either!

1901
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,090
Are you serious?!

1902
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,970
In any case, look for Bege!
Listen! Don't let him get away, no matter what!

1903
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,930
I understand!

1904
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,810
Clank.

1905
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,750
Hey! Check on them right away!

1906
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,440
What?

1907
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm telling you to check up on the Territorial Sea Slugs on the sea floor!

1908
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,030
Yes, sir!

1909
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,570
What the hell is happening down there?!

1910
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,500
At Sea - The Nostra Castello

1911
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,500
{\an8}Nostra Castello: "Our Castle" in Italian.

1912
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,960
I was expecting more of them to chase us!

1913
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
What's going on?

1914
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,770
Maybe they're not tracking our location-rero.

1915
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,420
The Territorial Sea Slugs?

1916
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,810
Rero.

1917
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,860
If there are Territorial Sea Slugs,
then the Transponder Snails should react.

1918
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,890
But they're silent-rero.

1919
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,870
I've never heard of anything like this!

1920
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,110
But that's great. Keep it at maximum speed!

1921
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,280
Hurry to Cacao Island!

1922
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,360
Let's take the shortest route to pick up Chiffon!

1923
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,280
-Yeah!
-Rero!

1924
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,470
Clank.

1925
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,460
This is Nusstorte, speaking from Germa's ship.

1926
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,460
{\an8}Nusstorte: "Engadner Nusstorte", a Swiss nut tart.

1927
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,070
Big Brother! How did things go with Germa?!

1928
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,940
We crushed them with ten thousand soldiers.
Their kingdom has been devastated!

1929
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,830
Oh!

1930
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,290
As expected! But you shouldn't go overboard like that...

1931
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,260
With our strength, it was a piece of cake...

1932
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
By the way, Big Brother...

1933
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,740
Germa Kingdom

1934
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,740
You didn't destroy their cloning system, did you?

1935
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,290
Of course not.
That's what we came here for.

1936
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,250
But other than that, the place has been
completely destroyed.

1937
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,290
That's the least we could do!

1938
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,630
Damn Germa! They were doomed
the moment we had them in our sights!

1939
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,270
What happened to the Straw Hats?

1940
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,550
Actually, we accidentally let them get away.

1941
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,170
They're heading due west...

1942
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,810
Well, it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

1943
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,490
I'll leave it to you!

1944
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,080
Yeah, good job!

1945
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,130
Clank.

1946
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,490
And that's how you do it...

1947
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,150
So Luffy-kun and the others are okay.

1948
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,300
What should we do now?

1949
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,430
Let's go! Set sail!

1950
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,670
Roger!

1951
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,980
Muscle Balloon!

1952
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,030
Why should I stand here and watch...

1953
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,570
when I already know that you're going to power up?

1954
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,330
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

1955
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,880
I'll tell you this now...

1956
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,570
I'm not underestimating you!

1957
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,950
Mirror Mochi!

1958
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,510
What? That's mochi?!

1959
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,980
This is bad! If I get crushed under all that mochi, I'll be buried alive!

1960
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,150
Yes, you'll suffocate.

1961
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,610
This is where you die!

1962
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm sorry that the fight has to end like this...
but it's made me a little irritated.

1963
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,030
Because you held on for much longer than expected...

1964
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,360
I'm 40 minutes late for today's merienda.

1965
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,360
{\an8}Merienda: Spanish word for a light meal.

1966
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,290
The suffering won't last long...

1967
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,670
Farewell, Straw Hat...

1968
