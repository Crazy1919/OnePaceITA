1627

Nice work out there, Ichiji, Niji.

1628
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,600
The war-torn Broc Coli is another victim of
the fall of the Doflamingo regime, you could say.

1629
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,710
Their army could no longer acquire weapons
from Doflamingo, so they turned to us for help.

1630
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,450
They gave up on the idea of
merely suppressing their rivals...

1631
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,020
It's a good example of how halfhearted kindness
only leads to more bloodshed in the end.

1632
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,460
Who cares about the reason why?

1633
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,360
We just make whoever pays
us gets to win, and that's it.

1634
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,530
If we had crushed both sides,
we could've earned even more money.

1635
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,500
That's what pirates would do.

1636
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,340
We're still a member nation
of the World Government.

1637
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,150
Speaking of which, Father,
the Reverie will take place soon.

1638
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
Yes.

1639
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,420
However, they'll likely strip us of our right
to attend the Reverie starting from this one.

1640
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,530
All of you, be prepared for it!

1641
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,100
The power that we'll get in exchange
is tremendous!

1642
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,200
Germa will change!

1643
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,280
It's rare for anything to bring so much pleasure to Father.

1644
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,010
I can't believe you came in handy, after all.

1645
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,720
Sanji!

1646
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
We were surprised on the day that you disappeared.

1647
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,340
Truly.

1648
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,520
We used to talk about you from time to time.

1649
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:38,560
We wondered where the funniest place for you to die would be, and how it might happen.

1650
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,770
You still have food on your plate, Niji.
Eat all of it.

1651
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,380
This?
I'll just leave it. I'm not hungry.

1652
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,470
I ate tons of chocolate earlier, and this sauce that's poured on it looks nasty.

1653
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,410
It's all sticky and gross.

1654
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,830
I'm throwing this away.

1655
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
Eat it!

1656
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,400
You don't know how valuable food is or how much work goes into cooking, you dumb prince!

1657
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,840
Dumb?!

1658
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,970
You're a weakling, Sanji!

1659
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,510
You have no right to insult
me and tell me what to do!

1660
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,140
Call the head chef!
Where are you, Cosette?!

1661
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,020
Head Chef
Cosette

1662
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,250
Because you served this disgusting stuff,
my brother has offended me!

1663
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,120
Yes, sir! I'm sorry!

1664
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,330
I shouldn't serve anything
unpalatable to you...

1665
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,200
Okay.

1666
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,190
Stay right there, Cosette.

1667
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,050
You bastard...
How low will you sink?!

1668
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,410
Are you trying
to leave a scar on a lady's face?!

1669
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,210
What did you say? A lady?

1670
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,050
Why are you defending a mere kitchen maid?!

1671
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,390
What a gentleman.

1672
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,420
Now the food's on the floor.

1673
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,100
This is Aligot.
It's a mixture of potatoes and cheese.

1674
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,600
Sanji-sama, I'll clean it!

1675
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,800
Potatoes strengthen the immune system
and stabilize blood pressure.

1676
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,690
They're very nutritious.

1677
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,380
And maybe because you guys are so special,

1678
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,710
the cut of meat in the confit
has been carefully selected too.

1679
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,210
It's a very elaborate dish to make
for breakfast.

1680
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,950
Oh, please don't, Sanji-sama!

1681
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,030
A person of royal blood mustn't
eat food off the floor!

1682
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,920
Hey, are you out of your mind?!
That's disgusting!

1683
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,530
It's perfectly flavored, too.

1684
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,840
The spirit of the poor has taken root in you!

1685
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,140
Stop doing such a disgraceful thing!

1686
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,010
Don't, Niji! He hasn't been married yet!

1687
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,690
Thank you, sir.

1688
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,200
You only bring shame to the Vinsmokes.

1689
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,740
What's shameful to me is
being part of this family!

1690
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,860
What?!

1691
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,210
An idiot who has no respect for food.
A man who beats a woman!

1692
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,110
The arrogance of royalty that compels you
to see your servants as less than human!

1693
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,490
Everything about you guys goes against
what I stand for!

1694
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,220
What you're saying is the kind of
nonsense all those losers spout, Sanji.

1695
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,230
I've never understood the way you see things.

1696
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,100
Royalty operates by its own set of rules!

1697
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,470
You're the unreasonable one!

1698
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,800
He's right.
You're more wrong than ever.

1699
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,640
Is it because of the bad
influence from this man, Sanji?

1700
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,530
Big Mom's ability to collect information
is greater than people think.

1701
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,890
So you were working at his
restaurant until two years ago.

1702
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,200
We've already zeroed in on its location, too.

1703
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,280
Seems like this picture was taken recently.

1704
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,840
The sea restaurant, Baratie!

1705
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,990
What's wrong? You're turning pale.

1706
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,220
Where did your spirit from earlier go, Sanji?

1707
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Say something. Huh? Hey!

1708
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
What are those?

1709
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,980
These are bracelets to prevent
him from escaping-bon.

1710
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,990
Seems like both the Straw
Hats and Sanji himself are

1711
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,360
going to oppose this marriage-bon.

1712
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,630
I'll lend you these bracelets
and tell you his weak point just in case-soir.

1713
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,430
His weak point?

1714
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, only in the worst-case scenario
where you refuse to comply,

1715
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,030
Will I stoop to asking you if you want us to chop his head off.

1716
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,460
Don't do anything stupid.
You know what we're capable of.

1717
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,410
Don't ever resist.

1718
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,660
Give up on your friends and
accept your marriage to Pudding.

1719
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,990
Then, everything will wrap up neatly.

1720
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,650
What happened to your leg?

1721
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,750
Why?!

1722
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,620
I can't think of any reason for you to be kind to me!

1723
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,730
Why...? Why did you?!

1724
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,570
Because you...
have the same dream as me.

1725
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,010
The All Blue...

1726
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,960
This is awesome, you damn geezer!
Is this the sea restaurant?

1727
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,280
We're gonna be busy!

1728
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,120
We'll be fine 'cause I'm here!

1729
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,320
Hey, baby eggplant!

1730
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,790
You're too slow, baby eggplant!

1731
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm not, you damn geezer!

1732
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,170
Fooling around with a woman again,
baby eggplant!

1733
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,240
Baby eggplant!

1734
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,500
Baby eggplant!

1735
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,810
Baby eggplant!

1736
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,010
Baby eggplant!

1737
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,380
Baby eggplant!

1738
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,990
Baby eggplant!

1739
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,980
Sanji!

1740
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,190
Don't catch a cold.

1741
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,770
Owner Zeff!!

1742
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,630
Thank you for all the damn things you've done for me
over all these years!!

1743
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,380
I'll never forget your kindness...
for the rest of my life!!

1744
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,930
Let's have a peaceful wedding tomorrow.

1745
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,590
We'll have lunch with
Big Mom and Pudding today.

1746
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,710
Prepare to leave for her castle.

1747
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,530
Okay, Sanji?

1748
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,150
Damn Straw Hat... Where did he go?

1749
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,050
Search for him.

1750
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,520
10 minutes is long...

1751
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,960
I can't even use Haki.

1752
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,110
Is somebody there?

1753
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,630
Somebody, help! Call a doctor!

1754
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,880
Hey, stay with me!

1755
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,610
Damn! They waited until I wasn't around!

1756
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,660
What did she do to deserve this?!

1757
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,500
They beat a woman unconscious...

1758
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,470
I've never met such scum!

1759
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,240
It's your fault, Sanji.

1760
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,470
Yonji!

1761
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,890
You gave a woman of low birth
a taste of self-confidence.

1762
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,420
What do you mean by that, you bastard?!

1763
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,700
Do you want to see Niji?
Obviously, he's the one who did it.

1764
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,270
Follow me. I'll take you to him.

1765
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,670
You're gonna be fine. Don't worry.

1766
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,610
What's wrong? Are you coming?

1767
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,090
Yeah, I'm more than happy to!

1768
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,000
This is...

1769
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,060
You were curious, weren't you?

1770
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,500
We were never allowed in here as kids.

1771
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,130
54 Type-MBs. 30 Type-MSTs.

1772
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,210
And 21 Type-MHs need to be restocked.

1773
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,410
Got it.

1774
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,800
What are they?!

1775
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,250
Do you want to know what they are?

1776
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,920
Germa 66 is feared around the world.

1777
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,440
And these are its soldiers!

1778
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,550
Cracker-sama!!

1779
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,950
Cracker?! Is that him?!

1780
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,760
What's wrong, King Baum?

1781
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,090
Why are you taking Straw Hat's side?

1782
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,050
There is a good reason for it...

1783
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,670
No excuse.

1784
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,450
I'm gonna kill you all!

1785
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,930
What's with him?

1786
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,680
Woman, I'm Sweet Commander Cracker.

1787
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,860
Don't touch...

1788
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,710
...my friend!

1789
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,550
Straw Hat!

1790
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,400
The soldiers of Germa 66?!

1791
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,430
Why are they in water?

1792
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,330
It's a bio-culture liquid.

1793
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,770
They all have the same face...
Are they actually alive?

1794
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,560
Sanji, human beings...

1795
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,640
...can be built!

1796
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,230
Germa has been a kingdom of science
for generations.

1797
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,050
Believe it or not, our father is a brilliant scientist.

1798
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,880
Before we were born,

1799
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,410
he was part of a lawless research team
in a foreign territory

1800
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,350
where he was studying and developing weapons with the great Dr. Vegapunk.

1801
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,330
He was with Vegapunk?!

1802
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,520
Yes, when he was younger.

1803
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,630
What Vegapunk discovered at that time was

1804
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,720
the presence of Bloodline Elements
within living things!

1805
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,430
It was just one step away from
usurping God's place.

1806
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,580
In essence, he found the blueprints of life.

1807
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,020
The World Government saw it as dangerous
and arrested Vegapunk.

1808
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,530
The research team was disbanded.
Or rather, it was absorbed by the Government.

1809
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,630
However, our father escaped
the Government's reach

1810
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,080
and continued his research here in Germa.

1811
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,270
The research into replicating and augmenting life itself.

1812
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,630
Thus leading to the birth of this secret facility!

1813
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,180
They're all clones of
just a few talented soldiers!

1814
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,390
They're Clone Soldiers!

1815
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,020
Clone?!

1816
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,260
Of course, none of them are aware of that.

1817
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,320
You see, Sanji?

1818
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:59,210
Many countries are afraid of our army,
but at the same time, they wish to have it.

1819
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,580
It only makes sense, they are mighty, subservient...

1820
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,040
They're programmed not to fear death
and not to turn on their masters.

1821
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,740
When they die, we can just replace them.

1822
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,460
It takes five years to create
a twenty-year old soldier.

1823
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,290
This is the depot where we
keep a stock of the soldiers.

1824
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,280
Look. It only takes five
years to create them,

1825
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,740
but they look like they've been around
for two decades.

1826
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,010
Stop it! That's enough!

1827
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,910
I'm going to be sick.

1828
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,990
Sanji.

1829
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,840
When we heard that you became a pirate,

1830
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
I thought maybe our little failure was actually growing up a bit.

1831
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,910
Then it turned out you were as big a disappointment as ever.

1832
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,810
Niji!

1833
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,650
You sick bastard...

1834
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,540
What are you doing over there?

1835
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,280
You kitchen maid.

1836
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,090
Um...

1837
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,220
What did Cosette-chan do...

1838
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,810
...to deserve that?!

1839
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,660
What you did was a high crime!
I'll teach you a lesson!

1840
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Wait, Sanji! Don't forget that we're
holding a hostage in the East Blue!

1841
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,220
Stealth.

1842
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,500
I can't believe it...
Have you taken a liking to that kitchen maid?

1843
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,270
Don't fight back.
Otherwise, there will be blood in the East Blue.

1844
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,750
Henry...

1845
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,020
...Needle!

1846
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,110
You should've told me.

1847
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,480
If I knew you were in love
with that kitchen maid,

1848
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,650
I wouldn't have messed up her face.

1849
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,250
But if you have no problem
with that swollen face,

1850
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,340
I'll appoint her to be
your servant right away.

1851
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,550
Once again, welcome back, Sanji.

1852
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,100
To the Vinsmoke Family!

1853
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,880
I think it's high time we re-establish the hierarchy here.

1854
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,320
You are... a failure.

1855
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,090
Listen!
You children are my greatest scientific achievements!

1856
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,910
You were born as superhumans
through scientific modifications

1857
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,680
representing the best that
research has to offer!

1858
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,450
Without living under the
sway of foolish emotions,

1859
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,900
each of you will eventually
lead your own troops

1860
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:07,530
and one day rule Germa 66 with the ever-evolving power of science!

1861
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,300
I have given you the ability. The rest comes down to discipline!

1862
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,600
Yes, Father!

1863
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,390
Now, Sanji-sama!

1864
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,330
Ow, ow, ow...

1865
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,270
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

1866
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,550
Where's Sanji?

1867
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,060
I don't know.

1868
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,180
Come on. Come on.

1869
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,910
Come here.

1870
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,010
Stop playing with a turtle!

1871
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,030
How dare you!

1872
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,610
Don't talk to me like that!

1873
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,280
Humph! That'll teach ya!

1874
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,360
--Sanji-sama!
--Niji-sama!

1875
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,110
Stop! Ouch!

1876
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,820
I give up! Niji!

1877
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,990
Oh, please stop!

1878
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,580
Niji-sama...

1879
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,960
Let go! I still wanna hit him!

1880
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,640
Why is Sanji weaker than the others?
He's lagging far behind the others' scores.

1881
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,140
We have the test results.

1882
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,520
Ichiji-sama, Niji-sama and
Yonji-sama are making excellent progress.

1883
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,690
Their exoskeletons are developing well

1884
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,490
and their resilience and strength are equivalent to full-grown men.

1885
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,600
However, Sanji-sama is...
It pains me to say...

1886
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,750
What is it? Say it.

1887
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,210
He must be considered a failure.

1888
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,050
We thought we successfully manipulated
the Bloodline Elements for all four of them.

1889
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:57,160
But for some reason, Sanji's Bloodline Elements
are no different from when he was born.

1890
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,420
So you mean...

1891
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,630
Sanji-sama is nothing but a human.

1892
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,990
Why do you help me?

1893
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,540
You don't want me to?

1894
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,410
I do!

1895
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,790
Reiju, you're so kind.

1896
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,650
Shut up! Be quiet!

1897
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,130
You're kind, but why do you laugh at me?

1898
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,140
What else can I do?!
If I try to stop them, they'll bully me, too.

1899
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,490
I don't want that!

1900
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,830
The Liar

1901
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,830
Noland

1902
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,830
The Devil Fruits

1903
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,830
Oh, there he is!

1904
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,180
You can eat that.

1905
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,410
I made it for you.

1906
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,320
Is it good?

1907
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,290
Sanji! Are you cooking food for rats again?!

1908
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,870
Royalty does not serve!
How many times do I have to tell you?!

1909
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,320
But, I...

1910
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,790
Your mother is dead!
Stop chasing her shadow!

1911
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,700
Unlike your siblings, you have no talent!

1912
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,100
Therefore, you must work 10 times harder...
No, 100 times harder than the others!

1913
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,710
You are a piece of my plan to restore Germa to glory!

1914
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,510
Do not let me down!

1915
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,320
Never cook again!

1916
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,050
Is that how you run, Sanji?!

1917
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,600
No progress.

1918
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,540
--So he has no potential.
--Right.

1919
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,420
What a waste of life.

1920
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,440
What should we do?

1921
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,400
An unthinkable shipwreck... I mourn!

1922
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,530
I was expecting all five of them
to lead Germa into the future together!

1923
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,600
I have lost a promising son!

1924
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,350
What?! What is this?!

1925
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:37,150
What's this? I can't take it off!
What are you guys doing?!

1926
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,140
Did Sanji really die?

1927
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,120
I don't know. Who really cares about him anyway?

1928
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,030
Wait! I don't wanna be in here!

1929
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,560
Let me out!

1930
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,950
Don't leave me behind!
I'm scared! I'm gonna die!

1931
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,740
I want my dad!

1932
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,810
Dad! Help! They're gonna kill me!

1933
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,080
This was His Majesty's decision.

1934
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,380
What? Dad's decision?

1935
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,150
No way! There must be a mistake!

1936
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:22,590
His Majesty said that he wants to pretend that
you were never born.

1937
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,830
What?

1938
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,990
Why...?

1939
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,660
Please let me out, Dad...

1940
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,170
I'm sorry... I'm sorry that I was born weak!

1941
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,560
Help me... Dad, help me!

1942
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,880
Dad!

1943
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
