Your Majesty!

1634
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Hey, Koza.

1635
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,320
Vivi-chan looked very excited.

1636
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,180
I guess her pirate spirit is back.

1637
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,540
Just when I was thinking
 she had become more like a princess.

1638
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,220
Yes, this is Hina. We just left Alabasta.

1639
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,620
We'll get the Nefertari Family to Mariejois safely.

1640
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,470
Navy HQ Rear Admiral,
"Black Cage" Hina

1641
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,460
Hina-sama, accept these flowers!

1642
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,480
I picked them for you!

1643
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,860
I don't want them.

1644
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,900
Jango! Fullbody!
Get to your positions now!

1645
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,270
Yes, ma'am!

1646
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,140
Vivi-sama! Vivi-sama!

1647
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,420
It's dangerous, Vivi-sama!

1648
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,480
Please come down from there this instant!

1649
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,830
Princess of the Alabasta Kingdom
Nefertari Vivi

1650
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,920
Vivi-sama!

1651
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,270
What a nice sea breeze...

1652
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,970
What would you do if a strange bird comes and grabs you?!

1653
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,920
And what if there's a sniper targeting you,
or if a meteor falls from the sky?!

1654
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,380
You worry too much.

1655
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,160
Vivi-sama used to be a pirate, after all.

1656
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,080
What's wrong with you, Pell?!
The Navy is watching us!

1657
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,480
Don't push yourself, Your Majesty.

1658
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,100
If you're not feeling well,
we'll head back right away.

1659
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,220
No, I'm fine.

1660
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:56,130
{\an8}Ever since I met Nico Robin, I've wanted to ask the World Government something.

1661
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,130
King of the Alabasta Kingdom
Nefertari Cobra

1662
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,320
All I wanted was to know the history...

1663
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,050
There are too many enemies in the way of my dream...

1664
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,540
About the Poneglyphs?

1665
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,830
I'm determined to attend this year's Reverie!

1666
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,280
If possible, I wish to learn...

1667
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,420
what it was the Nefertari kings of the past did to the world!

1668
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,850
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1669
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,150
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh...

1670
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,990
Hey! Behave yourself, Vivi-sama!

1671
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,730
Father-sama, how are you?

1672
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,020
Not well.
I might not live much longer...

1673
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,150
If only my daughter would find a husband before it's too late.

1674
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,100
That's not fair!
You're using your illness against me again!

1675
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,160
We've got tons of pictures of potential suitors!

1676
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,970
Throw them away!

1677
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,670
East Blue - Loguetown

1678
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,030
Congratulations on your enthronement, sir.

1679
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:32,680
Our hotel was built exclusively for royal families
who attend the Reverie every four years.

1680
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,760
We do hope you enjoy your stay.

1681
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,730
It isn't not-not-so-bad.

1682
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,730
Queen of the Goa Kingdom
Sarie Nantokanette

1683
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,520
Right, darling?

1684
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Well, it's nothing special.

1685
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,700
All it offers is a view of the scaffold
where Gold Roger was executed.

1686
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,290
W-well, please do ease the fatigue of your travel here...

1687
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,770
King Sterry.

1688
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah, I will. Now be gone from my sight, trash.

1689
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,510
Y-Y-Yes, sir!

1690
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,850
{\an8}The countries of the world are in a restless state...

1691
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,730
{\an8}due to the Reverie that takes place at the center of the world...

1692
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,520
{\an8}in the Holy Land of Mariejois, every four years.

1693
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,870
{\an8}Here, at the very highest of conferences, fifty leaders will come together...

1694
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,750
{\an8}to discuss and debate the world's most serious topics...

1695
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,580
{\an8}and agree upon a shared direction of the future.

1696
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:47,240
{\an8}But due to the prudent natures of the most powerful of leaders, the meetings are not always calm.

1697
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,620
The leader of the Happo Navy - Don Chinjao...

1698
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,860
West Blue - Kano Kingdom

1699
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,860
I mean, the new leader Sai is not back yet, is he?

1700
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,610
Since Straw Hat and the others
 took down the Donquixote Family,

1701
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,820
our enemy can't buy weapons from them.

1702
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,150
Thanks to that, the war is over.

1703
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,570
It seems we will make it to the Reverie in time.

1704
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,960
There are so many things I need to say!

1705
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,280
Beneath the Red Line,
The Ryugu Kingdom

1706
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,550
I can't do it.

1707
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,890
I'm scared.

1708
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,860
Luffy-sama made a promise to me!

1709
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,980
{\an8}When we meet again, he's going to take me on a walk in a real forest on the surface!

1710
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,980
The Princess of the Ryugu Kingdom,
Shirahoshi

1711
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Of course, Luffy-kun will be able to take you much farther if you want!

1712
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,030
But on this trip, we're going straight up to Mariejois.

1713
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,280
Your brothers and the Neptune Army
will be there with you, Princess Shirahoshi!

1714
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,850
Oh goodness...

1715
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,060
{\an8}Father, what if we let Shirahoshi skip this one, mi-re-do?

1716
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,060
Prince of the Ryugu Kingdom,
Ryuboshi

1717
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,270
Yeah! We got tons of signatures on the petition...

1718
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,710
Prince of the Ryugu Kingdom,
Manboshi

1719
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,560
that asks to relocate Fishman Island!

1720
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,460
Ooh! Mambo!

1721
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,850
That is like saying we don't trust humans-jamon.

1722
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,850
King of the Ryugu Kingdom,
Neptune

1723
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,730
What should we do?

1724
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,720
Shirahoshi, what did you learn from the Straw Hats?

1725
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,720
Prince of the Ryugu Kingdom,
Fukaboshi

1726
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,860
This meeting is what our mother Otohime
 was looking forward to.

1727
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,530
Come with us!

1728
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,300
South Blue,
Evil Black Drum Kingdom

1729
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,250
Wapol-sama! I have a report!

1730
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:46,270
The kingdom you once ruled, the Drum Kingdom, has a new name. It's the Sakura Kingdom now!

1731
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,550
They say that Dalton will be attending the Reverie as its king.

1732
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,390
What?! The Sakura Kingdom?!

1733
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,970
Damn that Dalton...

1734
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,440
I wonder what I can do to drag him down at the Reverie?!

1735
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,620
Grand Line
Sakura Kingdom

1736
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,620
What did you say, Dr. Kureha? Are you serious?

1737
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,650
Why do you all look so unhappy?

1738
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,650
King of the Sakura Kingdom,
Dalton

1739
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,780
I said that I'll be your ship's doctor.

1740
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,820
Aren't you happy?

1741
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,800
Kingdom of Passion
Dressrosa

1742
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,800
What?! Can I come too?!

1743
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,290
Of course, you can!
Would you like to come as my lady-in-waiting?

1744
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,140
I'd love to! Thank you, Viola-san!

1745
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,530
You must be excited, Rebecca!

1746
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,750
I am!

1747
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,850
Maybe I can wear my mother's dress!

1748
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,020
Yes! That would be great!

1749
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,350
Prodence Kingdom

1750
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,790
King Riku! I turned down the battleship escort!

1751
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,020
King of the Prodence Kingdom
Elizabello II

1752
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,020
Would you like to accompany me to the Holy Land?

1753
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,070
King of Dressrosa
Riku Dold III

1754
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,440
Why does everyone think it's going to be a vacation?

1755
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,910
What's wrong with that?

1756
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,310
The Reverie is like a festival!

1757
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,060
{\an8}Meanwhile, Luffy's group...

1758
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,950
Hey... turn a bit starboard...

1759
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,420
Okay...

1760
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,870
Like this?

1761
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,290
Ah... a bit more.

1762
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,250
Hey, hey, hey!

1763
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,160
Put some spirit into it! Or we'll sink!

1764
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,260
Shut up! Because you jumped off the elephant all of a sudden, we're all worn out! Idiot!

1765
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,440
Thank you. Once again I can savor the joy of being alive...

1766
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,480
But... I'll make you pay for it!

1767
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,480
See... we're off course again.

1768
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,620
Turn to port...

1769
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,020
Okay! Leave it to me!

1770
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,110
See?! She's full of spirit...

1771
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,540
Wow! We really are on the water!

1772
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,930
Member of the Mink Musketeers
Carrot

1773
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,930
This big heavy boat feels like it's floating in the air!

1774
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,970
Wh-Why are you here?!

1775
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,760
Whaaat?!

1776
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,980
Carrot?!

1777
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,920
Carrot, why are you here?!

1778
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,820
I decided to tag along!

1779
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,370
Garchu!

1780
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,320
Nami!

1781
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,380
MUNCH!

1782
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,420
MUNCH!

1783
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,460
MUNCH!

1784
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,500
MUNCH!

1785
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:20,540
MUNCH!

1786
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:20,580
MUNCH!

1787
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:20,620
MUNCH!

1788
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:20,660
MUNCH!

1789
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:20,700
MUNCH!

1790
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:20,740
MUNCH!

1791
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:20,780
MUNCH!

1792
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:20,820
MUNCH!

1793
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:20,860
MUNCH!

1794
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:20,910
MUNCH!

1795
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:20,950
MUNCH!

1796
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:20,990
MUNCH!

1797
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,030
MUNCH!

1798
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,070
MUNCH!

1799
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,110
MUNCH!

1800
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,160
MUNCH!

1801
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,200
MUNCH!

1802
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,240
MUNCH!

1803
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,490
Chopper!

1804
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,560
CHOMP!

1805
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:23,610
CHOMP!

1806
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:23,650
CHOMP!

1807
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:23,690
CHOMP!

1808
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:23,730
CHOMP!

1809
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:23,770
CHOMP!

1810
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:23,810
CHOMP!

1811
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:23,850
CHOMP!

1812
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:23,890
CHOMP!

1813
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:23,930
CHOMP!

1814
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:23,980
CHOMP!

1815
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,020
CHOMP!

1816
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,060
CHOMP!

1817
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,100
CHOMP!

1818
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,140
CHOMP!

1819
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,180
CHOMP!

1820
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,220
CHOMP!

1821
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,260
CHOMP!

1822
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,300
CHOMP!

1823
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,340
CHOMP!

1824
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,380
CHOMP!

1825
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,880
Baron Corpse!

1826
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:28,620
CRUNCH!

1827
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:28,620
CRUNCH!

1828
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,410
CRUNCH!

1829
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,130
Too hard!

1830
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm sorry, but we have to go back!

1831
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,710
What?!

1832
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,620
Don't do that! Wanda's going to be mad at me!

1833
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,840
Do you want to be a bother to our saviors, Carrot?

1834
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,100
I just wanted to go on an adventure at sea, along with Luffy and the others, even if it's the only chance I get.

1835
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,020
We are infiltrating the lair of an Emperor.
This is no game!

1836
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,440
Please! I'll do anything! Just take me with you!
I won't cause any trouble! I even brought...

1837
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
Look!

1838
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,510
Lunch!

1839
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,860
Juice!

1840
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,990
A snack!

1841
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,370
An extra shirt!

1842
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,100
How long do you think that'll last?

1843
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,000
A good half day! Isn't the sea a big place?

1844
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,980
What?! It's going to take multiple days to get to Big Mom's territory?!

1845
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,550
Even on a straight route?!
I can't believe the ocean is so big!

1846
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,350
The ocean is like a wonderland!

1847
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,790
I've never spent the night away from home!

1848
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,890
A wonderland? We're in the ocean.

1849
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, well. You're on board now, so we'll have to deal with it!

1850
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,260
Can you defend yourself in a fight?

1851
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,740
Yes! Thank you! I'll be alright...

1852
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,930
Why are you eating my carrot?!

1853
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,370
Pat her head, Luffy!

1854
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,600
That was close!
You almost killed me! You're strong!

1855
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,660
It's fine, you can have the carrot.

1856
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,900
Luffy almost lost!

1857
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,970
Well, she is a good fighter.

1858
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,760
Pedro-san, when did you get up there?
You really like heights.

1859
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,370
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

1860
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,610
Somebody, make something!

1861
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,950
All right! I'll do it,
 so just watch the waves for me, okay?

1862
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,400
Yes, sir!

1863
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,240
Yay!

1864
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,080
It'll be 5000 Belly per person.

1865
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,240
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

1866
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
That'll drain all of our allowances!

1867
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,110
Then what should we do?

1868
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,040
Either I make the food, or you do it, Brook.

1869
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,420
You're right.

1870
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,630
If we leave it to Luffy-san,
who knows what he'll make for us?!

1871
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,750
I'll make something!

1872
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,850
What?!

1873
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,740
You can count on me!
 I'll cook you a lot of delicious dishes!

1874
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,090
Oh, no...

1875
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,350
Oh, please don't... Hey, wait!

1876
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,540
Food! Food! Food!

1877
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,180
Wait! Don't do it!

1878
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,440
Luffy! Can you even cook?!

1879
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,800
This is quite a large headline.

1880
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,780
"The island, for decades veiled in mystery..."

1881
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,250
"was finally discovered."

1882
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,760
"The Revolutionary Army's general headquarters - Baltigo..."

1883
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,150
{\an8}The Revolutionary Army HQ has been discovered.

1884
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,660
"is in utter ruins!"

1885
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,800
What?!

1886
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,660
{\an8}The Revolutionary Army HQ has been discovered.

1887
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,880
The Revolutionary Army got defeated?!

1888
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,300
I thought you-gara were
the son of Dragon the Revolutionary.

1889
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,500
Sabo!

1890
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,750
That's my brother!

1891
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,450
Sabo-san?! The brother you said you met at Dressrosa?

1892
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,820
Is he the Chief of Staff?! Then he's the second in command of the Revolutionary Army!

1893
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
What kind of trio of brothers are you?!

1894
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,660
Then... this Dragon guy next to him is...

1895
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,480
Yes, that's him!
Remember what your grandpa told us two years ago!

1896
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,300
The name of your father is...

1897
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,670
Monkey D. Dragon. He's a revolutionary!

1898
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,970
The leader of the Revolutionary Army - Dragon.

1899
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,330
That's your dad!

1900
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,640
What?! This is my dad?!

1901
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,140
You're just now finding that out?!

1902
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,260
I've never seen him before!

1903
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,710
What?! Luffy's father is
 the leader of the Revolutionary Army?!

1904
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,530
Amazing! Amazing! Garchu!

1905
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,690
Didn't you look into him at all over the past two years?!

1906
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,200
Normal people would be at least a little bit curious if their father was such a famous figure!

1907
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,180
Robin even worked under him while we were separated.

1908
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,290
I see! This is the first time I've seen him!
He doesn't really look like me.

1909
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,690
In any case, I'm worried about Sabo!

1910
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,030
Jeez...

1911
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,040
Well, it is hard to empathize with a picture.

1912
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,510
An anonymous source revealed the location of the headquarters.

1913
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,880
But by the time the Navy and Cipher Pol arrived...

1914
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,000
the Blackbeard Pirates had already laid the base to ruin.

1915
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,430
Blackbeard?! Those bastards!

1916
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,010
But... why would Blackbeard, an Emperor, attack the Revolutionary Army?

1917
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,690
Back at Dressrosa, Sabo fought that champion guy.
 Maybe that had something to do with it?

1918
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,960
{\an8}Hey, Luffy!

1919
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,950
Apparently, Blackbeard clashed briefly with Cipher Pol before fleeing.

1920
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,870
Hey, Luffy!

1921
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,170
The article doesn't say anything about any casualties.

1922
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,350
Hey!

1923
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,270
If your-gara father or brother were captured or killed, it would've been the big headline.

1924
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,640
Hey, Luffy!

1925
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,720
So I guess they're okay for now.

1926
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,630
Yeah! You're right!

1927
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,160
Hey, Luffy!

1928
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,430
What do you want?!

1929
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,600
Thank you for cooking for us,
but is that supposed to happen?!

1930
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,990
Huh?

1931
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,860
Fire?!

1932
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,360
Oh, no! I forgot to turn off the stove!

1933
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
What?!

1934
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,870
Something exploded!

1935
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,330
Put out the fire!

1936
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,790
Wait! A storm is coming!

1937
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,750
What?!

1938
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,720
What is this?! Electro?!

1939
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,220
Hoist the sails!
 The wind will rip them to shreds!

1940
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,640
What about the fire?!

1941
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,560
The rain will put it out!

1942
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,790
We're lucky!

1943
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,160
There's nothing "lucky" about it!

1944
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,240
You help, too!

1945
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm half-dead!

1946
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,380
Zou

1947
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,680
Then... Carrot is out at sea now?!

1948
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,070
Why didn't you tell us sooner, Bariete?

1949
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm sorry-saru, Wanda!

1950
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,240
I told Carrot that she had to
 tell everyone that she was going-saru.

1951
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,570
But she said...

1952
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,550
No way! If I tell anybody,
they'll try to stop me!

1953
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,310
I see! She bribed you-teia, didn't she?

1954
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,040
Shock!

1955
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,960
You caught me-saru...

1956
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,500
But Carrot didn't want to go behind your back, Wanda!

1957
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,410
It's fine.
I'm just glad we know where she is.

1958
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,600
I was more worried about her being missing.

1959
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,340
She'll be safe if she's with Luffy's group.

1960
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,650
Duke-sama, please get some rest.
I will have extra guards put in place.

1961
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,160
I suspect that our enemy has a Vivre Card.

1962
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,440
But how did they get it?!

1963
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,970
I only hope that the card was lost with the ships Zunisha sank...

1964
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,320
Do you think they'll come back?

1965
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,000
We'd better be on the lookout.

1966
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,260
Indeed.

1967
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,950
Hurry up!

1968
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,550
Hurry up and pull me out of here!

1969
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,360
In a Certain Country

1970
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,700
As we thought,
Jack-sama failed to rescue Joker!

1971
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,800
That puts an end to our arrangment for those SMILE artificial Devil Fruits!

1972
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,830
He's a crying drunk today.

1973
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,680
Then... we can't make any more Gifters!

1974
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,960
Joker! Oh, Joker!

1975
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,050
How did you let yourself get beaten?!

1976
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:13,070
We were going to create the greatest crew ever, made up of just Devil Fruit users!

1977
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,990
And yet...

1978
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,170
You were taken out by a bunch of upstart brats before that dream could come true!

1979
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,640
Poor, poor Joker! It's all because he was such a terrible weakling...

1980
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,720
But everyone's talking about Straw Hat these days.
If you underestimate him...

1981
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,920
If I underestimate him...

1982
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,210
Then what?!

1983
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,400
Who do you think I am?!

1984
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,040
He turned into an angry drunk!

1985
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,560
K-Kaidou-sama... Please calm down!

1986
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,480
Straw Hat Luffy! Trafalgar Law!

1987
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,090
I know! They're from that generation, right?!

1988
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,900
Those brats think they're something
just because they brought down a Warlord!

1989
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,470
They must be aware that they messed with my business!

1990
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,230
Screw them!

1991
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,030
Hey, you there!

1992
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,200
Tell those idiots from your generation this:

1993
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,660
"Run away now while you can. All we've been doing is playing pirates"!!

1994
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,410
Eustass "Captain" Kid!

1995
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,740
Oh, it's cold!

1996
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,940
Back on the
Thousand Sunny

1997
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,460
We patched up the roof!

1998
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,020
Okay, good work.

1999
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,160
All right! The storm has passed!
And we patched up the roof that blew off!

2000
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,300
We kept the food I made safe, so let's eat!

2001
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,660
Yay! Food! We're starving!

2002
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,080
Oh, is it that good?!

2003
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,000
My specialty curry!

2004
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,270
Luffy, we can't eat uncooked rice!

2005
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,760
What's that bitter purple stuff?

2006
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,960
It's full of fish bones.

2007
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,370
Too much jam!

2008
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,420
There's something sticky and light blue.

2009
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,440
What did we do to deserve this?

2010
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,020
How could you guys be so rude after I took the time to cook this!

2011
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,890
Yuck!

2012
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,900
See, we told you!

2013
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,910
This isn't edible!

2014
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,620
Don't flip the table over!

2015
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,210
How dare you waste food!
Sanji-san would be mad if he heard about this!

2016
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,520
All the food we loaded... it's gone!

2017
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,890
Yeah, I messed up a lot, so I used all of it.

2018
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,870
What?! That was a week's
 worth of food for all of us!

2019
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,320
I thought you were hungry!

2020
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,050
It's not funny!

2021
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,230
What are we supposed to do now?!

2022
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,960
Luffy...

2023
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,080
Hey, I'm starving...

2024
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,530
Sanji-san! Help us!

2025
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:27,940
{\an8}And so, in just the first day of Luffy's journey...
The crew was at risk of starvation.

2026
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,750
A Few Days Later,
Big Mom's Ship

2027
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,790
Ship! Ship! Ship! Ship!

2028
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,040
I thought this was snow, but...

2029
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,760
It's Cotton Candy Flurry-soir!

2030
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,520
That Transponder Snail's been ringing off the hook...

2031
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,790
It's receiving warning signals-bon.

2032
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,210
That means we're in
 Mama's territory now-soufflé.

2033
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,000
Does the signal extend to that spot over there?

2034
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,090
You're a quick learner! That's Tarte 28.

2035
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:09,890
It is an outpost where a platoon from
 the Big Mom Pirates is standing ready-millefeuille!

2036
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,290
If we weren't on one of Mama's ships,
they'd attack us with a rapid "Boom"!

2037
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,740
Now, have you made up your mind?
Don't be so stubborn.

2038
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,020
Follow Germa 66's example and swear allegiance to the Big Mom Pirates-bon.

2039
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,480
That is your father's wish-amour.

2040
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,710
Don't talk about him!
It makes me sick to my stomach!

2041
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,500
Our relationship has already been broken off!

2042
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,870
I'm only going there to clear things up.

2043
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,100
Don't try to act tough.

2044
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,850
Mama is in a more
 welcoming mood than you might think.

2045
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,530
Of course, she knows you're
that foolish Straw Hat's comrade-il vous plaît.

2046
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:16,330
But she admires how you were once a chef at the sea reastaurant in the East Blue-bon.

2047
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,970
Depending on your skill, she may offer you an even better position-jour.

2048
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
Screw that!

2049
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:30,350
Listen! The only use for these hands of mine...
is to cook food for my friends!

2050
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,460
For that purpose, I even trained myself in hell!

2051
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:50,290
I'm sure they're missing my food and crying about it right now...

2052
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,640
How absurd!

2053
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,610
I would never make a dish for the kind of people...

2054
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,740
who would take out of their own comrades without a second thought!

2055
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,650
Oh, you're talking about Pekoms, huh?

2056
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,370
He let his personal feelings interfere with his work.
Bege did the right thing.

2057
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,160
Baron Tamago.

2058
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,540
Vito!

2059
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,380
We got a photo of Pudding-sama
from Whole Cake Island-rero!

2060
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,160
So you can prepare yourself.

2061
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,640
They know it's hard to marry someone you've never met. How nice of them to send this.

2062
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,020
It doesn't matter, you idiot.
I'm not getting married!

2063
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,670
Just take a look.

2064
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,350
Shut up! Stay away or I'll kick you to death!

2065
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,790
Well, come on.

2066
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,500
Cut it out...

2067
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,930
This is your bride-to-be...

2068
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:00,730
The 35th daughter of the Charlotte Family.
Charlotte Pudding-sama!

2069
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,830
