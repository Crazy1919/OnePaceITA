780
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,770
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,040
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,240
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}

800
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,790
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,580
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
{\an8}

812
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,850
{\an8}After their guide Pekoms disappeared,
Luffy's team left Cacao Island

813
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,080
{\an8}and is following Pudding's directions
to Whole Cake Island

814
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,340
Emperor of the Sea, Charlotte Linlin

815
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,740
{\an8}where Emperor Big Mom is.

816
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,660
I'm worried about Pekoms.
We gotta look for him!

817
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,680
Thank you, but that won't be easy.
He's a tough man, so he'll be okay.

818
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,480
Yeah, but...

819
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,190
At any rate, we need to get
to Whole Cake Island

820
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,070
without being seen by the enemy.

821
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,480
Hey, where are we now?

822
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,780
We haven't gone far from Cacao Island yet.

823
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,620
Hey, I see an island!

824
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,840
Yay! What kind of snack will be there?!

825
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,050
I can tell from the smell!
It must be something sweet!

826
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,380
The next one is probably a town made of jam.

827
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,080
Jam?!

828
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,690
We're not gonna stop there though.

829
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,020
What?!

830
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,100
Here, look.

831
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,820
When we spot Jam Island,

832
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,350
instead of approaching it, we turn in
the direction of the second Log Pose.

833
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,720
But it's sweet! Nami!

834
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,190
We're not gonna go there
even though it's sweet?!

835
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,700
Let's see...

836
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,960
That way.

837
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,370
Okay!

838
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,260
Luffy, starboard! In the direction
of three o' clock!

839
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,430
{\an8}Sanji translates to Three O' Clock.

840
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,430
That's right! Chopper! Carrot!
We're going in the direction of Sanji! 

841
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,050
But it's sweet!

842
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,270
We're gonna go pick up Sanji!
Hard a starboard!

843
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,550
That's too much!

844
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,890
You're bad at this, Luffy-san!

845
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,770
You too, Brook!

846
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,570
But it's sweet...

847
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,940
By turning towards the next island
before getting too close to another one,

848
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,480
we can avoid their surveillance network,
she said.

849
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,410
Oh, so that's how you read the map.

850
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,700
Can you do it?

851
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,870
Count on me.

852
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,130
Luffy-san, I'll take it from here.

853
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,160
Okay.

854
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,120
Alright, guys, I'll cook something for you!

855
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,810
What?!

856
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,210
I gotta cook!

857
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,170
Please!

858
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,500
Luffy, wait a second!

859
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,540
What do you want, Nami? I'll cook.

860
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,340
No!

861
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm not gonna mess up this time!

862
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,390
I'll do it! Don't you ever set
foot in the kitchen again!

863
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,310
I'm not paying you one dime!

864
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,480
I don't need your money!

865
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,020
What?!

866
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,820
Can I look, Pedro?
I wanna help!

867
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,860
Okay.

868
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,650
Let's see...

869
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,250
Hey! The water is grape-colored!

870
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,330
Grape?

871
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,120
There is an island that
spills juice around here.

872
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,300
It's no harm to us.

873
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,230
What?! Is that juice?!

874
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,170
This place is such a paradise!

875
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,920
Pedro, how do you know
so much about this area?

876
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,140
I've been here once before.

877
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,180
What?

878
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,380
It's gigantic!

879
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,800
Wow! It's big!

880
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,280
It's a Giant Sea Centipede.
They reside in this area.

881
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,810
No! Giant Sea Centipede, go away!

882
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,290
We'll be eaten!

883
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,200
Luffy, this is your job!

884
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,830
All right!

885
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,630
I'll do what little I can too!

886
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,790
Here it comes!

887
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,720
Rubber Rubber...

888
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,030
... Gatling!

889
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,700
{\an8}Meanwhile, on Whole Cake Island...

890
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,620
Whole Cake Island

891
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,620
Croquembouche!{\an8}

892
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,100
Mama! Stop! Mama!

893
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Mama... Mama, please stop!

894
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
Move!

895
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,720
Croquembouche!

896
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,040
Oh no! It's Mama's illness!

897
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,720
Hurry up-bon!
What does she want this time-soir?!

898
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,570
She wants...

899
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,820
... croquembouche!

900
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,840
Croquembouche?!

901
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,540
Is that the decorated dessert that
is composed of cream puffs piled up?

902
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,090
This will be a challenge.

903
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,330
Oh! No, wait!

904
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,840
I think there is a tourist group of...

905
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,000
... cream puffs staying at a
hotel in the city-je-t'aime!

906
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,010
They already checked out this morning.

907
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,300
Should we just make one?
What does the chef say?

908
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,450
I want to make the dough special.
Could you get me almonds?

909
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll tell the Minister of Nuts!

910
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Mama is heading towards Sweet City now!

911
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,100
She's coming this way?!
This is the capital! Mama's castle is here!

912
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,640
We can't talk her out of it!
She's losing her mind from the attack!

913
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,110
The death toll is still rising!

914
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,440
Issue an evacuation order in Sweet City!

915
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,460
Only a croquembouche can stop Mama now!

916
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,620
This way! Hurry up and evacuate!
Hurry up!

917
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,380
Mama, please stop!

918
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,130
Mama, let's not do this!

919
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,260
Bring me croquembouche!

920
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,850
Mama entered Sweet City!
She entered Sweet City!

921
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,190
Oh, she's finally here...

922
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,470
Mama's Hunger Pangs are
very troublesome-bon!

923
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,240
You don't know when the attack will strike.

924
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,060
The destruction continues
until she gets a bite of what she craves.

925
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,870
It's worse than any kind of disaster.

926
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,040
Anyway, evacuate all the residents!

927
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,930
Run! Hurry up!

928
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,880
Big Mom's having a tantrum!

929
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,800
– Stop!
– Not in this city!

930
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,470
Mama! Mama! Not in this city!

931
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,020
– She'll destroy her own castle!
– It's no good. She can't hear us.

932
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,630
Croquembouche!

933
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,140
Croquembouche!

934
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,220
This isn't it!

935
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
L-Look up!

936
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,720
This isn't the taste!

937
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,540
You losers aren't it either!

938
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,290
It's all wrong!

939
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,880
Croquembouche!

940
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,920
Thank you!

941
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,510
Oh, it's Moscato-sama!

942
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,980
The 16th son of the Charlotte Family
and the Minister of Gelato!

943
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,510
He's a member of Mama's family!
I'm sure he can stop her!

944
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,020
Charlotte Moscato
The 16th Son of the Charlotte Family
The Minister of Gelato

945
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,020
This is Moscato! How's the croquembouche?!{\an8}

946
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,580
I heard it'll take half an hour or so
to be ready-bon!

947
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,360
It'll be too late by then!
We can't let her destroy the castle!

948
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,490
This isn't it!

949
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,410
Mama! Stop it!

950
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,790
Who is that?!

951
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,510
Mama! It's me! Moscato!

952
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,540
Where is my croquembouche?

953
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,520
Croquembouche...

954
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,980
Croquembouche!

955
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,650
Give us 30 minutes! The chefs are trying
to make it as quickly as they can!

956
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,700
No, Big Bro Mos!
It's impossible to stop her!

957
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,490
I can't let her ruin the capital!

958
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,490
Move out of my way!

959
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,630
Don't you recognize me, Mama?!

960
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
Life...

961
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,600
...or...

962
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,350
... treat!

963
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,200
Life or treat...

964
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,360
Lifespan or snack!

965
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,240
You gotta be kidding, Mama!
He's your own son!

966
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,300
Mama, don't do it!

967
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,250
W-We have whipped cream here-fa!
No dough yet but Mama, don't!

968
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,550
Th-The treat is not here yet!

969
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,130
I'll take the treat...

970
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,680
Don't get in my way!

971
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,190
Mama!

972
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,320
Moscato, stay cool!

973
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,500
No-fa! Any sign of fear and your
lifespan will be taken away!

974
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,220
Have mercy, Mama!
I won't stop you anymore!

975
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,760
Just please! Don't kill me!

976
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,490
Give me 40 years.

977
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,550
Big Bro!

978
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,030
Moscato-sama!

979
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,830
She killed...

980
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,320
... her own son!!

981
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,100
Croquembouche!

982
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,520
Run! No one can stop her now!

983
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,270
That's terrible.

984
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Somebody's coming from the river of juice!

985
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,330
– That's...
– That man is...

986
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,750
No doubt!

987
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,830
Everyone, move!{\an8}

988
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,540
Jinbe – The Former Warlord
The Captain of the Sun Pirates

989
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,540
It's Boss Jinbe!{\an8}

990
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,210
Help!

991
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,510
We'll be eaten!

992
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,850
He has a croquembouche on his side!

993
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,640
He caught those tourist cream puffs for us!

994
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,230
They are coated with candy!
Did the Minister of Candy do it?!

995
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,500
Look over here!

996
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,700
Don't get in my way!

997
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,240
Catch this!

998
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,390
It's delicious!

999
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,650
– Yeah!
– Mama has cooled down!

1000
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,280
This is it!

1001
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,130
If it's delicious,
that's all that matters...

1002
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,540
Thank you, Boss Jinbe!

1003
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,080
Let the chefs know! The crisis is over!

1004
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,440
Summon all the ministers!

1005
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,060
Restore the capital as
rapidly as possible-bon!

1006
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,350
Oh my loyal knight of the sea, Jinbe!

1007
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,060
Good job bringing me the
Poneglyph the other day.{\an8}

1008
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,360
Charlotte Linlin – One of the Four Emperors
The Queen of Totto Land
The Captain of the Big Mom Pirates

1009
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,380
I can't read it though.{\an8}

1010
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,390
What do you want today?
Why are we out here?

1011
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,330
Oh? The city is looking better than ever.

1012
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,580
Did you do this?

1013
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,000
No, I just arrived,
and I have no clue what happened, ma'am.

1014
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,420
Oh...

1015
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,630
I'm here...

1016
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,720
... to tell you something important today.

1017
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,650
You're not gonna leave my crew, are you?

1018
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
A Few Hours Ago

1019
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,410
Straw Hat Luffy will
change the world someday!

1020
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,970
I know he is still young,
but I don't think any one of the

1021
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,710
current Four Emperors will
become the king of the sea!

1022
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,340
I think Straw Hat Luffy will be the one!

1023
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,880
I...

1024
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,310
... want to be of help to him!

1025
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,210
I'm too...

1026
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,860
... weak!!

1027
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,500
I... I want to get on board his ship...

1028
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,820
... and dedicate my life to him!

1029
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:04,460
I believe that journey will bring true freedom
to the Fishmen in the end!

1030
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:13,470
Aladine (A Brotula Merman)
The First Mate of the Sun Pirates

1031
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,300
For the last two years, you
told us a lot about Luffy-kun.{\an8}

1032
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,930
I've been thinking you should go join him
if you like him so much.

1033
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,680
D-Did I really?!

1034
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,640
Did I talk about him so much?!

1035
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,650
Go, Jinbe!

1036
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,320
Are you sure?

1037
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,740
No one here has the right to object, Captain!

1038
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah! You were a soldier of the Neptune Army,
but you became a pirate...

1039
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,670
... to fight with us, the former slaves
who fled from Mariejois!

1040
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,040
You became a Warlord
to help advance the social status of us Fishmen!

1041
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,570
And you allied with the Big Mom Pirates

1042
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,980
to protect us and our home,
Ryugu Kingdom, under Big Mom's name.

1043
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,710
You've always made choices
for the sake of others!

1044
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,210
You did enough, Jinbe.

1045
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,290
Yeah! Be free, Jinbe-san!

1046
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,380
– Go, Jinbe!
– Yeah, Captain Jinbe!

1047
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,210
We'll be fine without you.
Don't underestimate us!

1048
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,090
Live for yourself from now on!

1049
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,360
You guys... Thank you!

1050
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:12,000
Having said that, I don't think Big
Mom will let Captain go so easily...

1051
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,610
If she gets mad at us too,
all we can do is run!

1052
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,340
But what about Aladine-san?

1053
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,870
He got married to Madam Praline
and became a member of Big Mom's family.

1054
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,970
Oh?

1055
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,810
Are you guys worried about me?

1056
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,360
Oh, Madam!

1057
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,240
Charlotte Praline
(Half-Human, Half-Hammerhead Shark Mermaid)
The 29th Daughter of the Charlotte Family

1058
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,450
Are you talking behind my back?

1059
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,990
Did you hear what we said?!

1060
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,000
Hey, are you trying to
hide something from me?!

1061
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:56,260
Aladine! Don't tell me you were gonna
leave me behind if Mama gets angry!

1062
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,630
No, of course, I'd ask you...

1063
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,090
You don't need to ask!

1064
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:07,140
I'll definitely choose you over Mama!
If anything happens, take me with you!

1065
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,060
Oh, so passionate!

1066
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,080
Sorry, Wadatsumi.

1067
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,090
I just brought you here, but
as you heard, I've got to go.

1068
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,700
That's okay! I'm so happy
to be with these guys.

1069
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:31,500
Now, Praline, do you think Mama
won't forgive me... I mean, us?

1070
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,870
Well, there were precedents,
but those who wished to leave her crew...

1071
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,710
... are all dead.

1072
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,060
The Present: Whole Cake Island

1073
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,470
Sweet City
The Capital of Whole Cake Island

1074
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,320
Moscato-sama!

1075
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,660
Moscato-sama is dead!

1076
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,620
Don't die, Moscato-sama!

1077
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,000
Moscato-sama!

1078
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,220
They're finally here.

1079
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,000
Hurry up and take him away.

1080
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,600
Yes, ma'am.

1081
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,940
Step back.

1082
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
Listen, guys.

1083
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,540
Every last second. Okay?

1084
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,800
Moscato-sama...

1085
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,280
Say, do you think Boss Jinbe will
be killed too, Mont d'Or-sama?!

1086
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,980
How should I know?!

1087
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,920
When someone makes Mama angry,
this is surely what happens,

1088
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
even if it's her own son!

1089
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,580
Sweet City
Whole Cake Chateau

1090
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,740
I guess you're leaving, Jinbe.

1091
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,340
– Why, Boss?!
– Don't leave, Boss! Why do you have to leave?!

1092
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,750
Shut up!

1093
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Don't ask someone why they're leaving!
That's pathetic!

1094
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,380
Who cares?!

1095
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,520
If you're a pirate,
of course you want to live as you like.

1096
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,690
Am I delicious? Tell me, am I...

1097
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,140
Having said that,

1098
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,900
having a pledge of loyalty reneged
brings shame to a lord.

1099
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,110
Jinbe, you know this means
I'm going to lose a powerful asset – you.

1100
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,920
Yes, but...

1101
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,490
No "but"! You should lose something too!

1102
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,090
You have to pay a price!

1103
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,500
Bring me the roulette!

1104
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,810
What?

1105
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,360
Now, spin it.

1106
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,930
I can't wait to see what you're gonna lose!

1107
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,270
{\an8}Meanwhile, Luffy and the others are
on the water in Big Mom's territory.

1108
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,520
So sweet!

1109
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,340
Anyway, it's not moving a bit.

1110
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,630
No...

1111
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,430
Well, let's just stay here and sleep!

1112
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,290
No! What if those ants attack us again?!

1113
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,160
When the sun rises,
it'll begin to flow again.

1114
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,440
But during the night,
it gets cold and solidifies.

1115
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,500
Share those things beforehand!

1116
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,110
We've gotta melt it and get out
of this area of starch syrup!

1117
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah!

1118
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,950
Pull it!

1119
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,600
We just put the army of ants to sleep!

1120
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,150
It's gonna be trouble when they wake up.

1121
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,850
That's right.

1122
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,550
Those Sea Ants once ate my ship.

1123
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,530
Oh my!

1124
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,660
Once? What did you come here for?

1125
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,150
Pedro used to be a pirate
along with Pekoms.

1126
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,680
What?! Really?!

1127
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
I was so naive.

1128
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,960
I thought of myself as an explorer,
but I became a wanted person.

1129
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,800
I only accompanied Pekoms halfway.

1130
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,600
I trust you-gara people, so I can tell you.

1131
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,440
I was looking for Poneglyphs
because I wanted to help Master Cat Viper.

1132
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,530
But when I trespassed in Big Mom's territory,
it became my last voyage.

1133
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,450
I...

1134
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,360
... was defeated here once.

1135
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,500
I've seldom told anyone about this.

1136
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,340
I didn't know that.

1137
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,770
You have bad memories,
yet came back?

1138
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,190
If my experience helps you even a little bit
to take back Sanji, I'll be happy.

1139
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,610
On top of that,

1140
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,480
maybe it wasn't so bad that I came along.

1141
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,200
I heard our kings showed you-gara people
the Road Poneglyph at the Whale Tree.

1142
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,740
They did.

1143
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,310
I was surprised.

1144
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,640
Even though you may have saved us,

1145
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,170
they haven't shown it to anybody
other than the Kozuki Clan...

1146
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,130
... for 26 years...

1147
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,840
... since they showed it to
Gol D. Roger's pirate group.

1148
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,930
The Pirate King?!

1149
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,450
Later, Roger reached Raftel
and was called the Pirate King.

1150
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,110
You-gara people remind
Duke Dogstorm and Master Cat Viper of them.

1151
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:23,570
They're expecting you to become
somebody who'll need the Road Poneglyphs.

1152
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,260
What are you gonna do after you defeat Kaidou?

1153
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,790
That's too far ahead!
I haven't thought about it...

1154
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,960
Next, you'll need the Road Poneglyph
that Big Mom has!

1155
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,480
If so, this would be our biggest chance!

1156
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,550
Since we came this deep into her territory,

1157
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,140
we'd better steal Big Mom's Road Poneglyph
in addition to taking back Sanji!

1158
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,790
What? But that's...

1159
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,400
Not just Sanji, but also a Road Poneglyph?

1160
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,420
Well, Robin asked me to get it too,
but I wanna rescue Sanji first...

1161
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,160
I know.

1162
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,890
I'll get the Road Poneglyph.
You-gara guys go for Sanji.

1163
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,870
What?

1164
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,770
When we reach the island,
could I have a little time?

1165
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,470
This time, I'll get it!

1166
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,590
No, but if you're doing it for us,
we'll come with you!

1167
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,140
No, you make sure to protect Sanji.

1168
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,430
Even after you get him
back, things will be tough.

1169
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,750
Okay. Then I'll leave it to you!

1170
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,000
Great!

1171
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,650
Don't decide so easily...

1172
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,240
I wonder if Luffy-san was born to be lucky...

1173
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,860
What is it, Brook?

1174
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,870
Nothing. I am lucky too.

1175
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,000
What are you talking about? You're weird.

1176
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,840
Oh, the ants are awake!

1177
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,060
No!

1178
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,800
Ant! Ant! Ant! Ant!

1179
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,450
Here they come!

1180
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,950
Save the Sunny!

1181
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,550
The Next Day

1182
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,300
Hey, guys!

1183
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,710
Wake up!

1184
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,970
Huh? What is it?

1185
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,150
Look! Look!

1186
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,530
We're here finally!

1187
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,240
Wow, it's gigantic!

1188
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,140
So this is where the Emperor lives!

1189
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,510
There's a cake!

1190
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,510
That tallest whole cake is a castle
where Big Mom lives.

1191
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,150
A castle?!

1192
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,900
Nami-san, we'll continue
on straight like this?

1193
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,850
Yes, that cape is
the only place without security.

1194
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,570
I see.

1195
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,100
That's the place Pudding-san mentioned.

1196
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,810
Yeah, we have to really thank her.

1197
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,530
If it weren't for her,
I don't know if we could've make it this far.

1198
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,120
You're right.

1199
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,960
Hey, somebody's there!

1200
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,930
Sanji?

1201
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,170
Is that Sanji?! Hey!

1202
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,970
Sanji!

1203
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,300
