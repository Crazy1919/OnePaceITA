00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,570
Why is his voice coming out of a mirror?

2122
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,490
It's a long story, but Chopper and
 the others are in a mirror dimension.

2123
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,740
Are you okay, Chopper?

2124
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,960
Oh, Luffy! Thank goodness! You're really there!

2125
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,130
Luffy! Is Sanji-kun there, too?!

2126
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,670
Yeah, he's here!

2127
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,880
Sanji-san, I'm glad that you're okay.

2128
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,720
How are you guys?

2129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,150
We saved everybody from
 inside the mirror, Luffy!

2130
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,440
Brook even got copies of the Poneglyphs!

2131
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,780
Really?!

2132
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm impressed with you guys!

2133
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,580
Y-Your compliment doesn't make me happy, you fool!

2134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,690
You fool!

2135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,620
You silly little goose!

2136
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,750
Luffy, it's good that Sanji's there,
but did you two come to an agreement?

2137
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,560
Sanji isn't... coming back yet.

2138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,270
What?!

2139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,910
Listen, everyone.

2140
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,200
We're gonna crash Big Mom's Tea Party and the wedding.

2141
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
And we're gonna save Sanji's family!

2142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,380
And then, Sanji will leave with us!

2143
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,560
B... Big...

2144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,480
Luffy! She's an Emperor!

2145
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,280
I don't want to risk everyone's...
I mean, Nami-san's life over my own personal issues!

2146
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,700
So...

2147
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,250
Yay!

2148
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,050
Damn you!

2149
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,970
I heard you and Luffy got into a big fight,
so I was worried, you idiot!

2150
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,350
I'm so relieved! Really, you idiot!

2151
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,980
You big idiot!

2152
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,480
If we do that, then Sanji-kun will
leave with us, right, Luffy?!

2153
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,450
Nami-san... I...

2154
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,080
Oh, Sanji-kun.

2155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,500
For scaring me like you did...

2156
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,540
I will never forgive you!

2157
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,710
Nami...

2158
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,520
But we can talk about that later.
The Tea Party is soon.

2159
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm gonna help bring you back no matter what, Sanji-kun!

2160
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,080

What?! Are you proposing to me, Nami-san?!

2161
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:50,150
{\an8}Thump

2162
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,150
I don't know why, but I think you're fine now.

2163
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,660
Alright, Luffy, we know what we need to do now.

2164
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,820
Yeah.

2165
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,750
By the way, Sanji's sister saved my life.

2166
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,090
So I wanna save them all.

2167
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,720
Yes, let's save them all.

2168
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,930
But it will not be easy.

2169
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,390
Even though we're not aiming to
take Big Mom down,

2170
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,940
she always looks forward to
her Tea Parties.

2171
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,030
By crashing it,
we'll unleash the wrath of an Emperor.

2172
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,120
On top of that, while I'm sure you've faced a number of Big Mom's ministers,

2173
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,210
they are merely the tip of the iceberg of her forces.

2174
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,380
The figures attending the Tea Party will be even more fearsome.

2175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Not to mention her invited guests from around the world, the Rulers of the Underworld.

2176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,850
We, on the other hand...

2177
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,990
Have ten people in total.

2178
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,200
Hey! We're not part of this!

2179
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,070
Don't round up!
There are only eight of you!

2180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,490
I hope they slaughter you!

2181
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,580
Luffy.

2182
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,500
I've already told everyone here,

2183
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,300
but I need to tell you about something else.

2184
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,260
Have you ever heard of Capone "Gang" Bege?

2185
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,220
Yeah, he's the guy who took Sanji away.

2186
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,230
He's one of the Worst Generation,
with a name as infamous as yours.

2187
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,520
He hails from the West Blue,
where there are five powerful Mafia familes.

2188
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,730
They control the underworld.

2189
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,970
They are known as the Five Families of the West, and one of those bosses,

2190
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,040
is "Gang" Bege.

2191
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,420
He was given his "Gang" epithet when he was young.
He used to be a notorious hitman.

2192
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,460
A hitman...

2193
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,710
I heard he was a sick young man who cut the heads off helpless creatures...

2194
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,670
and took joy watching them in the throes of death.

2195
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,850
What kind of awful person would...?

2196
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,980
Now imagine that happening to an organization.

2197
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,760
How does it taste?

2198
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
I wish it were more bitter.

2199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,660
Then, how about this?

2200
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,740
Boss!

2201
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,600
You little...

2202
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,790
The lead tastes bitter, doesn't it?

2203
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,470
In his days as a young gangster, he killed the leaders of criminal organizations.

2204
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,190
And when he became the leader of his own family,
he continued to only kill his rivals.

2205
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,610
Bege?

2206
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,110
Don't resist.

2207
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,320
What? Are you betraying me?!

2208
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,180
You're outnumbered!

2209
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,530
Bege!

2210
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,330
But Bege...

2211
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,340
never showed interest in
his enemy's position or territory.

2212
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,290
He merely took their valuables and left.

2213
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,800
BLOODY TRAGEDY! AN INTERNAL FEUD?!

2214
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,260
WAKING NIGHTMARE! UNDERWORLD REMAINS TENSE

2215
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,720
THE UNDERWORLD SOCIETY IN CHAOS! TRIGGERED BY THE ASSASSINATION?

2216
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,070
Afterwards, he would enjoy watching
 the violent power struggles within the groups

2217
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,570
and the confusion of their allied syndicates.

2218
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,860
He is truly a tasteless man.

2219
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,990
But in this world, what goes around comes around.

2220
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,370
He is now targeted constantly
by those seeking vengeance.

2221
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,630
However,

2222
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:21,070
Bege treats that like a game.
He uses his iron fortres to fight them off,

2223
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,300
and mocks the weakness of his enemies.

2224
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,180
When he got tired of being on land, he went out to sea and continued to do the same things.

2225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,430
Boss!

2226
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,230
Who did this?! Damn!

2227
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,150
He's made his name by taking out pirates captains. Only the pirate captains.

2228
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,660
Even at sea, he is plagued
by enemies seeking revenge...

2229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,600
So, working for an Emperor
is his perfect safe haven.

2230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,380
That's why he decided to ally with Big Mom.

2231
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,110
Because Big Mom thought highly of his sharpened
sense of vigilance and incredible defensive ability,

2232
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,490
he was granted the title of "Rook" just before the upcoming Tea Party,

2233
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,400
and placed in charge of security for the entire event.

2234
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,650
Why are you telling us this now, Jinbe?

2235
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,110
If they are the security guards, nobody can stop them from achieving their goal.

2236
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
Huh?

2237
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,370
The main event of this Tea Party is the wedding.

2238
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,500
As you are now aware, Big Mom intends to slaughter the Vinsmokes during the ceremony,

2239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,380
and then acquire the remnants of Germa for herself.

2240
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,430
But meanwhile, behind her back,
 Bege has his own plan to take Big Mom's head.

2241
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,590
What?!

2242
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,010
What the hell is going on?!
Everyone is planning their own conspiracies!

2243
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,880
Luffy, I'm sure you remember that Pekoms was the one who guided you here.

2244
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,820
He was kidnapped by Bege,

2245
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,030
and they tried to get him to cooperate with their plan.

2246
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,240
Pekoms... So that's where he went...

2247
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,590
Pekoms is loyal, so he refused. In order to keep him quiet, Bege shot him off a cliff into a swarm of sharks.

2248
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,720
What?!

2249
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,270
But...

2250
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,070
my companions were watching,
and saved him just in time.

2251
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,570
He's currently recuperating.

2252
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,310
Thank goodness! He's okay!

2253
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,450
He's been through a lot.

2254
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,750
Damn that Bege guy! I'll make him pay!

2255
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,500
Luffy, this is what I wanted to discuss with you.

2256
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,720
I came up with a plan
 after I learned everything from Pekoms.

2257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,390
I tried to predict your actions.

2258
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,310
I figured that if you learned the truth,

2259
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,150
you would decide to rescue Sanji and his family.

2260
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,230
Perhaps it's not fair to Pekoms,
but considering the circumstances...

2261
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,890
Should we really
make an enemy of Bege?

2262
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,700
The Tea Party begins at 10 A.M.

2263
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,330
That's about five hours from now.

2264
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,130
The ten of us need to come up with a plan in that timeframe.

2265
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,390
Stop counting us as a part of this!

2266
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,760
You damn brutes!
I'll let them know what you're up to!

2267
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,940
Listen, Luffy, Bege and his crew have been
 relentlessly preparing for this day.

2268
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,080
Luffy! Sanji!

2269
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,060
Let's ally with Bege!

2270
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,070
What?!

2271
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,320
But... you're probably right.

2272
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,910
What?!

2273
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Hey, are you insane, Luffy?!

2274
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,100
Luffy wants to do this?!

2275
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,650
You see? I told you he would want to!

2276
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,960
Luffy, four of our six here are against this!

2277
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,800
Don't you care about Bege-san's ill deeds?!

2278
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,880
Well, this way, everything'll work out, right?

2279
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,980
You can't make a decision like that...

2280
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,020
Actually, I arranged a meeting earlier.
Do you want to go meet them?

2281
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Okay, let's go right now!

2282
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,140
What?!

2283
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,040
Don't worry. If something doesn't feel right, you can refuse!

2284
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,080
We have a different goal, after all.

2285
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,880
Luffy, Sanji. Bege and his crew's base
 is on the northwest side of the island.

2286
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,110
The eight of us will head there first
from this dimension. See you there!

2287
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,920
Stop counting us as part of your group!

2288
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,090
Okay, got it!

2289
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,930
Fire Tank Pirates' Base,
 Whole Cake Island

2290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,060
Did you get rid of Bobbin?

2291
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,440
Fire Tank Pirates

2292
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,440
That's right, he was chasing Black Leg.

2293
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,180
I told you, Germa are my heroes.

2294
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,320
"Monster Gun" Vito

2295
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,490
Are they really coming here?

2296
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,470
Father?

2297
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,660
"Hitman" Gotti

2298
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,710
Jinbe isn't the type of man to joke around.

2299
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,670
Since we're both opposing Big Mom,

2300
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,010
we shouldn't make extra enemies -
he's right about that.

2301
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,380
Everything after that depends on what Straw Hat says.

2302
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,100
If it doesn't work out...

2303
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,100
we'll just kill him!

2304
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:15,360
The Cooks Are Busy Preparing
 the Wedding Cake...

2305
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:15,360

2321

Eastern Inlet

2322
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,770
No, Pekoms! You need to rest!

2323
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:40,320
Grr! Did Jinbe really tell Mama about that rat, Bege?

2324
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,740
Of course!

2325
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,160
By now, I'm guessing that Bege
has been beaten to death by Mama.

2326
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,520
Grr! You guess?! Your guess isn't enough!
I gotta make sure to tell her...

2327
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,290
Whoa-whoa.

2328
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,880
You need to keep resting, Pekoms.

2329
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,180
But, Praline, in case they stop him from telling her... Grr!

2330
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,690
If you're concerned about that,
then leaving it to Jinbe is the best option!

2331
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,310
You'll be beaten again in your current condition.
 Just keep quiet!

2332
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,810
He's right, Pekoms!
As a ship's doctor, I won't allow you to go!

2333
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,530
Don't move a muscle!

2334
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,950
He's right! He's right!

2335
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,870
– Yeah.
– Rest! Rest!

2336
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,710
You guys are acting weird.

2337
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,000
Gulp!

2338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,390
There was something going on
last night in the inlet.

2339
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,390
I saw some people carrying things around!

2340
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,510
Gulp!

2341
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,640
I appreciate that you saved me,
but I need to leave!

2342
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,090
Wait, wait, we can't allow that!

2343
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,860
What do you mean you can't? Grr!

2344
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,340
What are you guys hiding?!

2345
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,800
Gulp!!

2346
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,780
This is it!

2347
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,420
Fire Tank Pirates' Base

2348
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,750
This is Bege's base!

2349
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,140
So, what kind of guy is Bege?

2350
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,480
You heard what Jinbe said.

2351
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,940
You coward!

2352
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,030
Think of him as a scheming
and brutal mafia boss.

2353
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,710
4 Hours and 15 Minutes
 Until the Tea Party

2354
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,450
My hero! Vinsmoke Sanji of Germa!

2355
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:11,060
"Monster Gun"

2356
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,190
I'm so happy to see you again-rero!

2357
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,100
It's you...

2358
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,140
Hey, where's everyone else?
Are you Bege?

2359
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,650
Don't be in such a rush.
They are here or rero.

2360
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,360
What do you mean by "rero"?!

2361
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,650
Oh, Luffy! Sanji!

2362
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,700
Sanji!

2363
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,800
You made me worried, you bastard!

2364
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,950
I'm sorry for that... Hm?

2365
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,540
That aside, why are you dressed like this?

2366
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,350
Why don't you guys go take a bath too?

2367
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,090
Why are you so relaxed?! We don't have time!
And you don't even like baths!

2368
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,630
No, you two must take one, too-rero.

2369
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,350
We'll talk afterwards-rero.

2370
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,470
A bath right now?!

2371
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,770
Father won't meet with anyone who is dirty.

2372
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,610
Who's dirty?!

2373
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,870
Women's Bath,
 Bege's Base

2374
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,500
What?! Lola was turned
 into a warthog zombie?!

2375
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,470
And she was chasing around
a guy she fell in love with!

2376
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,140
That definitely sounds like Lola!

2377
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,500
Back then... and now once again
in those scary woods,

2378
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,020
I don't know what would've happened to me
if it weren't for Lola.

2379
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,750
I see! But you guys saved my sister, too!
Thank you!

2380
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,360
Oh, I'm crying tears of joy.

2381
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,900
We've been close our entire lives.

2382
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,370
Since we're twins!

2383
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,660
A zombie! I can't imagine a dead person moving.
The sea is like a wonderland!

2384
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,370
So, was Lola turned back into a human?

2385
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,500
That's right. I'm sure she's still
doing well as a pirate.

2386
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,720
I wonder if she found someone to marry...

2387
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,770
Big Mom sounded so mad when she talked about
Lola running away from a marriage.

2388
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah... that was a big deal.

2389
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,860
What?

2390
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,990
Mama is reviled by all Giants
in the world for a reason.

2391
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,200
All of the Giants in the world?

2392
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,800
That's why even though
Totto Land has a diverse population,

2393
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,670
there are no Giants.

2394
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,210
Giants really exist!

2395
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,400
One day,

2396
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,590
Lola had a surprise suitor...

2397
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,260
who claimed it was love at first sight.

2398
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,770
It was none other than Prince Loki of Elbaf,
 the land of the Giants!

2399
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,480
A prince?! Amazing!

2400
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,480
Mama practically cried with joy.

2401
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,990
She thought if Lola became
the princess of Elbaf,

2402
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,780
her long-standing feud with
the Giants would be resolved,

2403
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,580
and she'd even gain access to the army of Elbaf,
the country known as the mightiest in the whole world.

2404
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,250
I see...

2405
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,480
So that's what she ran away from.

2406
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,920
It all went downhill from there.

2407
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,960
She tried to use me as a substitute,

2408
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,190
but he noticed that I wasn't Lola.

2409
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,230
So her relationship with the Giants
got even worse.

2410
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,780
Then, she gave up the idea of
becoming friendly with actual Giants,

2411
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,660
and started investing in research
to gigantify regular humans instead.

2412
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,960
Her anger towards Lola only worsened,
and she was branded a criminal in this country!

2413
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,710
If she ever comes back, she'll be killed!

2414
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,300
Furthermore, she couldn't stand looking at me anymore, since I look just like Lola.

2415
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,510
Get that damn face out of my sight!

2416
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,890
When she saw me, she hit me without mercy.
For years, I always had fresh wounds.

2417
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,950
I was afraid that my own mother would kill me!

2418
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,570
I can't see that monster
as my mother anymore!

2419
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:47,180
However, Lola is very carefree... She probably has no idea that her mother wants to kill her.

2420
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,920
I see... Everything makes sense now.

2421
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,550
So when Bege said he was going to assassinate Mama,
I felt nothing at all.

2422
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,810
You might think I'm terrible,
but it's the truth.

2423
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,800
Well, well, that bath felt so good!

2424
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,470
Ah, just like heaven!

2425
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,650
No, I refuse to
 move on to the next life!

2426
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:20,280
This feels like the aftermath of a battle... I'm getting too relaxed. It hasn't even started yet!

2427
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,120
Luffy-san, Luffy-san.

2428
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,500
There's milk in here. Milk!

2429
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,130
Hey, don't go through our fridge without asking!

2430
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,590
That's exactly what I needed.
I lost my tooth.

2431
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,220
And my face has been cracked.

2432
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,680
Thank you for the milk!

2433
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,700
All better!

2434
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,270
How is that even possible?!

2435
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,580
3 Hours and 30 Minutes
 Until The Tea Party

2436
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,910
I won't forgive you, Chiffon!
I can't believe you!

2437
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,780
How can you help someone
who wants to kill Mama!

2438
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,050
Chiffon-sama, please think about this!
You know no one could ever kill Mama!

2439
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,920
Big Sis Brûlée!

2440
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,180
You know what she's done to me, right?

2441
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,520
I'm worried about Lola.
Bege and Pez are my only family now!

2442
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,210
I don't need anyone else!

2443
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,560
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

2444
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,570
Okay, everyone's gathered, right?

2445
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,490
Have you cleaned yourselves up a bit?

2446
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,870
As the saying goes, "The suit makes the man."

2447
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,210
I won't talk to anyone that doesn't take care of their appearance.

2448
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,090
So, we've got three and a half hours to go.

2449
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,510
Let's first decide...

2450
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,560
If we're working together or not.

2451
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,620
They're good, aren't they, Luffy?

2452
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,170
Why don't you guys restrain yourselves?!

2453
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,250
What? These are for us to eat, right?

2454
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,800
From our perspective, you guys are just a nuisance.

2455
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,020
The easiest solution would be for us to kill all of you, here and now.

2456
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,520
Are you sure about that?

2457
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,520
If I die, you won't have your chance to kill Big Mom.

2458
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,580
Because the ceremony would be cancelled.

2459
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,860
If I'm not back two hours before the wedding, they'll be suspicious.

2460
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,630
Yeah. I hate to admit it, but you're right.

2461
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,330
We'll keep you alive, in that case.

2462
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,170
We don't have time to waste on threats.

2463
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,800
Luffy, how are you feeling about this?
Can you work with them?

2464
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,010
What do you think?

2465
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,200
You're Caesar, aren't you?!

2466
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,690
What?! Caesar?! Where?!

2467
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,330
He's been here the whole time...

2468
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,250
How could you not notice...?

2469
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,930
This research is so pointless!
I'm not gonna work anymore!

2470
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,560
Go ahead and do as you like with me, Big Mom!

2471
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,600
Caesar Clown!

2472
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,280
I-I-I'm working my butt off!
Tell that to Big Mom!

2473
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,940
There's no need.

2474
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,950
What?

2475
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,910
When I asked them to let me watch over you,
they agreed without a question.

2476
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,540
I'm now a trusted Rook!

2477
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,250
Is that my heart?!

2478
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,140
I'm willing to let you go.
If you help me in return, that is...

2479
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,490
You bastard!
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?!

2480
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,360
I'm the genius scientist Caesar Clown! 
I could destroy the world if I wanted to!

2481
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,040
I know who you are.

2482
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,410
That's why I came here.

2483
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,370
Damn!

2484
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,330
I served Big Mom and now Bege!

2485
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,260
I gotta work anyway!

2486
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,340
Are you doing your job-rero?

2487
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,590
I am! Who do you think I am?!

2488
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,260
This is much more to my liking
than what she had me do!

2489
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,010
The greatest piece of art
will soon be completed!

2490
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,480
That's good to know.

2491
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
The Straw Hat Crew will be here shortly-rero.

2492
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,530
What?! The Straw Hats?!

2493
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,990
Oh, come on!
I never wanna see those guys again!

2494
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,400
When they're around,
everything goes wrong!

2495
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:05,470
Father wants you to attend the meeting too-rero.

2496
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,960
Don't be late.

2497
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,380
I can't believe this!

2498
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,430
I've got no choice!

2499
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:27,150
C-Caesar?
No, I am Bege's blood brother...

2500
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,530
"Gangster" Gastino!

2501
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,110
"Gangster"
 Gastino

2502
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,870
– He's not even attempting to hide it...
– "Gastino"?

2503
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,740
Because he's a gas human?

2504
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,040
He's even laughing the same way.

2505
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,070
I see. 
I thought you were someone else. Sorry about that.

2506
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,360
No, you were right!
He's obviously Caesar!

2507
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,170
What?!

2508
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,750
Oh, so it is you!
What are you doing here?!

2509
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,050
Do you really think I'd be here if I had a choice,
you idiot?!

2510
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,680
Because of you guys,
I was handed over to Big Mom

2511
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,430
and my only escape from certain death was
 this guy taking my heart and making me his slave!

2512
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,890
I'm being pushed around!

2513
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,280
If you see Trafalgar Law, tell him I'll kill him when I see him again!

2514
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,190
You too, if I get the chance!

2515
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,110
Cut it out! This is so pointless.

2516
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,120
What a waste of time.

2517
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,550
Straw Hat...

2518
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,710
Are you going to work with me or not?

2519
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,100
First of all, let me punch you for shooting Pekoms!

2520
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,520
Here I go!

2521
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,530
Stop it!

2522
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,030
What?!

2523
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,290
Pull back your fist, Luffy!
We won't come to an agreement this way!

2524
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,960
But he shot my friend!

2525
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,100
Anyone talking bad about Father is unforgivable!

2526
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,920
No, Gotti! Calm down-rero!

2527
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,050
Cut it out!

2528
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,670
I don't care. Let him do it.

2529
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,760
Kick these bastards out!

2530
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,390
You back off!

2531
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,520
Why?!

2532
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,900
I knew this would happen...

2533
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,230
Well, it can't be helped...

2534
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,940
Do you like Big Mom?

2535
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
– No way!
– No way!

2536
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,540
Then you're on the same side.

2537
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,910
Even if you don't share the same lifestyle or goals,
you have a common enemy!

2538
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,080
You can kill each other later,

2539
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,130
but if you join hands now,
it'll be in everyone's favor!

2540
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,870
So what's the plan?!

2541
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,520
I've planned the whole thing in exacting detail.

2542
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,680
Let's just do it!
Then, I'll be through with you guys!

2543
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,800
