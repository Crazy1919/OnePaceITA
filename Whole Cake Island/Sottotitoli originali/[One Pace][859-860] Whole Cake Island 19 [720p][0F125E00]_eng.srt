Bege.

2085
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,120
I have no interest in assassinating Big Mom.

2086
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,790
But is she really the type of person we can kill with guns and cannons?

2087
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,880
From what I've heard, she's like an iron balloon.

2088
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,090
I feel like this is going to be impossible.

2089
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,990
Yeah, if we're going to do this assassination, it has to be done in one blow.

2090
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,850
Otherwise, we'll be caught in a siege and get killed.

2091
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,380
Is an Emperor really as strong as they say?

2092
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,270
Definitely! She's a monster!

2093
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,580
When we tried to retrieve Brook, she was fast asleep. But I still thought we were goners!

2094
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,030
She killed her own son for the sake of sweets.

2095
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,980
On that note, why did you choose the Tea Party, where all of her top officers will be in attendance?

2096
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,280
as the assassination location, Bege-san?

2097
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,010
Well, I knew you guys would ask that...

2098
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,070
First of all, let me explain something.

2099
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,680
Under exact conditions, we'll only need five seconds to kill Big Mom!

2100
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,230
Only five seconds?!

2101
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,360
It's not only five seconds-rero!

2102
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,190
It's won't be that easy to
 create that five second opening at the party-rero.

2103
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,380
The Big Mom Pirates is made up of
a bunch of skilled fighters, and they'll all be there.

2104
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,330
Within a split second, monsters like the Sweet Commanders will attempt to stop us-rero!

2105
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,470
At that point, it'll be a head-on fight, and we have no chance of winning that!

2106
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,050
This assassination plot began with
the capture of Caesar.

2107
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,850
My name is Gastino! Don't ever
 call me that in front of Big Mom!

2108
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,140
Listen!

2109
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,990
When this mission is over,
you'll give me back my heart and free me!

2110
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,810
That's what we agreed to!

2111
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,650
Don't forget that.

2112
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,500
If you break your promise,
I'll personally murder your son.

2113
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,790
Don't get paranoid now, Gas-hiko!
Bege will keep his word!

2114
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,080
Gas-hiko?! No, it's Gastino!

2115
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,540
Gas-hiko!

2116
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,420
You little...!

2117
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,880
Who cares what your name is? You're still a scumbag.

2118
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,760
Anyways, he's got a very crucial job.

2119
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,770
That's right!

2120
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,810
Let me show you what I made!

2121
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,000
Deadly poison gas - KX Launchers!

2122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,900
One will do the job, but I've got two extra, just in case!

2123
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Each of them can inject five grams of
deadly organophosphate gas...

2124
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,460
d-directly into your body!

2125
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,120
It's the most audaciously sinful murder weapon in history!

2126
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,360
The gas will destroy the average person by just touching their skin.

2127
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,140
So if it's injected directly into your body...

2128
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,970
I'm 100 percent sure...

2129
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,890
No, 200 percent sure that you'll...

2130
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,430
die!

2131
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,850
You're definitely gonna die!

2132
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,560
Everyone will die!

2133
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,750
Okay, I get the picture.

2134
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,360
So you have a weapon
that will kill her if it hits her?

2135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
No, unfortunately...

2136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,880
If Big Mom is at full strength...

2137
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,160
This weapon won't be able to pierce through her skin.

2138
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,290
There aren't that many weapons
that'll work against Big Mom in this world!

2139
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,430
Then it's pointless to have that thing!

2140
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,660
You gotta look at the big picture.

2141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,350
I said it wouldn't work when she's at full strength.

2142
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,250
There are two conditions necessary
to ensure the KX Launcher does the job properly!

2143
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,370
First we need a five-second window where no one is able to attack us.

2144
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,780
Secondly, Mama's body has to be weakened somehow.

2145
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,620
What kind of convenient situation is that?

2146
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,670
What are you doing?!

2147
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,800
There is one place where
 all those conditions will be met...

2148
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,470
That's the tea party!

2149
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,970
Oh, Pez!

2150
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,310
I'm sorry! Your daddy-waddy was too loud!

2151
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,770
It's okay, it's okay!

2152
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,150
We've been allied with Mummzie-wumzies for about a year now...

2153
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,360
Um, but we've never seen her get hurt.

2154
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,450
Even when she destroyed the city...

2155
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,870
Even when bullets...

2156
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,420
or bombshells hit her...

2157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,510
Even when she sinks a ship...

2158
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,310
We never saw her get a single scratch on her body.

2159
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,810
As you said, she's just like an iron balloon.

2160
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,690
But...

2161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,030
...there was one time 
I saw Mummzie-wumzie get a scratch.

2162
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,330
The Mother Carmel Picture Incident-rero!

2163
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,390
That's right.

2164
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,800
At tea parties, there's always a picture placed directly in front of Mama.

2165
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,010
and nobody else sits there.

2166
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,440
It's one of her most prized treasures.

2167
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,930
A picture?

2168
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,270
Yes.

2169
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,700
It's a portrait of Mother Carmel!

2170
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,650
You could say that it's Mama's only weak point!

2171
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,530
Who is that person?

2172
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,370
It seems like Mama is indebted to her,
but we don't know the details.

2173
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,380
She's a figure of mystery.

2174
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,990
Is she dead?

2175
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,250
I heard she disappeared.

2176
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,870
So she is a missing person.

2177
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,020
Even those in the family don't know the specifics.

2178
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,400
One time at a tea party, one of the servants accidentally knocked it off of the table.

2179
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,030
Mother...

2180
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,070
I was stunned by Mama's reaction to it.

2181
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,620
She turned pale, and let out
 a loud shriek that I'd never heard before!

2182
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,200
It was different from her hunger pangs!

2183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,720
All we could do was just
 cover our ears to protect our eardrums...

2184
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,350
People were passing out
and collapsing one after another!

2185
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,520
On top of the shriek,
 she unleashed her Conquerors Haki!

2186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,150
All because of a jostled picture.

2187
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,940
The point is what happened next.

2188
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,700
Mama knelt down from shock and, believe it or not,

2189
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,650
she scraped her knee and it was bleeding!

2190
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,860
I was surprised because I didn't think she had red blood flowing through her veins.

2191
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,970
When she breaks down like that,
her body becomes fragile.

2192
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,890
So, at the tea party today, if we break
 that picture in half, what do you think will happen?!

2193
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,860
Mama will be devastated!

2194
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,820
And no one there will be able to move
for more than five seconds!

2195
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,740
Then the KX Launcher
 will show its real strength...

2196
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,170
and the Emperor, Big Mom, will be killed!

2197
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,420
The news of the assassination of Big Mom
will spread across the world!

2198
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,100
But isn't that shriek gonna
paralyze us, too?

2199
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,160
Don't worry. We have these.

2200
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,560
"Invisible Symphonia System"!

2201
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, earplugs!

2202
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,190
If breaking that picture creates such a big mess...

2203
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,400
Then we gotta save Sanji's family during that time, too.

2204
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Hey, don't act like it'll be that easy.

2205
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,680
It'll take three seconds for Mama to freak out, after the picture is broken.

2206
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,920
If you're surrounded by the
 angry Big Mom Pirates before it gets messy,

2207
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,840
it'll be miraculous for you
to stay alive for three seconds!

2208
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,260
I need you to take that role, Straw Hat!

2209
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,020
Wait a minute!
That means Luffy is going to be bait!

2210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,430
Bege! Nami and her friends saved Lola!

2211
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,810
How could you ask him to be a sacrifice?!

2212
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,570
Okay!

2213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,520
I'll do it!

2214
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,380
What?!

2215
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,950
You need to think twice about this...

2216
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, I just came up with an awesome way
to arrive at the party.

2217
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,810
A way to show up?

2218
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,110
What?! What is it?
Sounds like fun! I wanna hear it!

2219
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,160
Me too!

2220
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,900
No way. If I tell you now, it'll ruin the fun.

2221
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,390
What?!

2222
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,020
– What was I worried for?
– What was I worried for?

2223
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,850
Sounds good. Then, I'll be counting on you.

2224
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,190
Sure!

2225
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,400
Now, do you know when to break the picture?

2226
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,040
When Sanji kisses Pudding, right?

2227
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,350
Idiot, I won't do that! I can't!

2228
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,740
The wedding kiss
will draw everyone's attention away.

2229
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,290
That's precisely when...

2230
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,460
Pudding-san will shoot Sanji-san!

2231
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll dodge her shot.

2232
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,760
The gunshot will be the cue.

2233
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,890
Okay! Sounds easy!

2234
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,510
Alright, let's go over the plan.

2235
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,690
When Pudding shoots, Straw Hat will break the picture!

2236
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,900
Big Mom will start to shriek.

2237
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,780
And we'll put the Invisible Symphonia System in our ears.

2238
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,990
Say "earplugs".

2239
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,660
Then, it'll be downhill from there.

2240
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,710
While the party-goers are in a panic,
you guys will rescue Germa.

2241
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,170
And with the KX Launcher
and the deadly poison gas shell,

2242
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,700
we'll assassinate Big Mom.

2243
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,510
This all needs to be finished in 10 seconds.

2244
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,400
As soon as we kill Big Mom,

2245
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,260
this idiot will arrive.

2246
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,960
Yes, that's when I'll arrive!

2247
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,350
Who are you calling an idiot?!

2248
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,190
– He's such a piece of crap.
– Is this jerk part of the plan?

2249
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,400
Shut up!

2250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,820
Listen, since I can fly,
I'll plunge on to the site with a mirror to escape!

2251
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,090
Along with this woman!

2252
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,370
I'm not part of this! Mama's gonna kill me!

2253
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,550
You guys did a great job bringing Brûlée here.

2254
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,430
We couldn't have hoped for a more useful power to help us escape.

2255
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,080
Your compliment doesn't
make me happy, you fool!

2256
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,880
You fool!

2257
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,900
Once you finish,
dive into Caesar's mirror quickly!

2258
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,640
Big Mom will still be shrieking.

2259
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,850
And then, we can just run away
in the mirror dimension at our own pace.

2260
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,070
The mirror will provide you
 the quickest way to escape from the island.

2261
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,070
Through the Mirro-world,
we can get to the Sunny in no time.

2262
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,650
That's quite a plan.

2263
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,740
Yeah, I think it's gonna work well!

2264
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,880
These bastards...!

2265
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,580
Once each of us gets to
 our own ships, our alliance is over.

2266
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,210
We should just get out of this territory as fast as we can.

2267
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,910
Good luck in battle!

2268
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,740
Alright!

2269
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,240
I guess we're set.

2270
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,030
The party starts at 10:00, right?

2271
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,150
Two and a half hours to go...

2272
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,270
I gotta go back to my room, since I'm the groom.

2273
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,180
We have to go back, too.
Let's get ready for fake security duty.

2274
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,140
Hey, Bege. Could you do me a favor?

2275
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,160
What is it?

2276
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,300
When I show up in a funny way...

2277
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,900
Don't try to be funny! You're gonna die!

2278
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,800
Cheese Town, Milk Island

2279
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
{\an8}Today is a holiday because of the Tea Party!

2280
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,260
Let's celebrate with Supreme cheese and beer!

2281
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,690
So Pudding-sama's old enough to get married now.

2282
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,720
The groom is Germa 66's third son.
We'll have a strong ally!

2283
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Peanuts Town, Nuts Island

2284
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,790
{\an8}I heard the whole Du Feld Conglomerate has arrived.

2285
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,860
{\an8}A lot of prestigious guests are going to be there today.

2286
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,400
Congratulations!

2287
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,900
{\an8}You're celebrating too early!

2288
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,450
Chocolat Town, Cacao Island

2289
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,450
{\an8}That's okay! I'm so happy!

2290
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,120
Today's Sanji-sama's wedding.

2291
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,120
Germa Kingdom

2292
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
The escort soldiers weren't allowed to enter the castle.

2293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,810
Obviously, we can't attend either.

2294
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,980
Of course not. No one needs a guard for a wedding.

2295
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,380
Yeah, it should be a peaceful day.

2296
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,970
Whole Cake Chateau

2297
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,310
Everyone from the Vinsmoke Family, good morning!

2298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,350
Yonji!

2299
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,200
{\an8}Wake up and change!

2300
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,400
6th Floor - A Guest Room In the Baum Cake

2301
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,580
{\an8}Where's Reiju? She's not in her room.

2302
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,230
Oh yeah, I haven't seen her since yesterday.

2303
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,710
Oh, Reiju-sama finished with
 her preparations in another room.

2304
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,750
I see.

2305
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,160
There is still an hour before
 the Tea Party, so take your time.

2306
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,990
{\an8}Wh-What happened?!

2307
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,130
9th Floor - Big Mom's Bedroom

2308
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,130
{\an8}Call the Ministers!

2309
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,510
I-It's not moving! It's dead!

2310
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,850
My cute little skeleton!

2311
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,770
That's too bad, but Mama...!

2312
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,400
Today is the Tea Party that you've been waiting for.

2313
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,070
And what else?

2314
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,510
♪ The wedding cake! ♪

2315
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,920
Mr. Morgans and all the other VIPs
have already arrived.

2316
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,220
Eastern Inlet, Whole Cake Island

2317
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,190
You can't do this to me!
Untie me, Grr!

2318
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:32,730
Aladine, The First Mate of the Sun Pirates

2319
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,610
{\an8}We'll leave some water and food.

2320
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,730
{\an8}I'm sorry but I'm sure
someone'll find you soon.

2321
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,110
Screw you!

2322
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,740
Where are you guys going?! Grr!

2323
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,410
– We're leaving this country.
– What?!

2324
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,080
That's why you guys were
carrying out your stuff all night long...

2325
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,820
Goodbye.

2326
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,140
You guys are affiliates of the Big Mom Pirates
and you're leaving the country...

2327
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,340
That means you're betraying Mama!

2328
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,140
Does she know about this?!

2329
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,760
We can't let her find out.

2330
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,350
She'll kill those who leave.

2331
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,770
That's what she does, right?

2332
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,610
Jinbe told us to say thanks.

2333
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,320
Jinbe did?!

2334
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,700
We're very lucky to have heard Pekoms' story.

2335
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,410
I don't think Bege can pull off his plan to kill Big Mom that easily,

2336
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,690
but I can't believe Mama is plotting
to assassinate Germa, too.

2337
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,470
If Luffy and his crew find out about it,
they'll push themselves to save Sanji.

2338
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,180
They'll be in danger, and I can't just sit back and watch!
I've got to help them!

2339
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,520
That means I will raise...

2340
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,350
a full-fledged rebellion!

2341
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,810
Charlotte Praline
21st Daughter of the Charlotte Family, Aladine's Wife

2342
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,120
{\an8}I will betray Big Mom.

2343
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,780
To fufill my duty to her,
I tried to tell her that I was leaving.

2344
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,450
But I withdrew that request,

2345
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,290
because of the numbers I saw on the roulette wheel.

2346
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:12,080
Those numbers represented the comrades who would've been victimized along with me!

2347
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,710
That's why I need you all to escape from here.

2348
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,920
The price that Big Mom wanted me to pay...

2349
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,680
was an unreasonable sanction
that was more than taking my life!

2350
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,100
On the day of the Tea Party, the Hors d'oeuvre Ships,

2351
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,440
interceptors from each island,
 will escort the guests, and security will be relaxed.

2352
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,630
And if something happens at the Tea Party,
it'll draw everyone's attention.

2353
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,740
So that's your chance to escape!

2354
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,790
I'm prepared for that.
That won't be a problem. But Jinbe...

2355
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,620
All we want to do is ensure that you can be free.

2356
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes, I know.

2357
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,480
No, you don't!

2358
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,420
In order to save Straw Hat,
you'd sacrifice your own life!

2359
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,640
Let's say I join the Straw Hats one day...

2360
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,910
I will be fighting for my captain, Straw Hat Luffy,
 with my own life on the line!

2361
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,980
Aladine, it's just a matter of...

2362
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,570
doing it now or later.

2363
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,360
I see. Do as you like.

2364
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,500
But do your best to save your own life too.

2365
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
Okay?

2366
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,420
We'll set sail for Fishman Island.

2367
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,960
You're worried about the Ryugu Kingdom too, right?

2368
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,130
Yes.

2369
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,550
We'll protect it no matter what!

2370
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm sorry!

2371
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,440
Don't apologize!
We've known each other for decades.

2372
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,900
We'll live to see each other again, Jinbe!

2373
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,330
Why would Jinbe feel the need to thank me?

2374
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,290
By the way, did he tell Mama...

2375
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,650
Hurry up and get ready to leave!

2376
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,170
Yeah!

2377
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,710
Hey, wait! You bastards!

2378
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,750
Whole Cake Chateau

2379
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,160
Where were you, Reiju?

2380
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,720
It's none of your business.

2381
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,370
I know you guys were partying the whole night.
So that's why I asked for a quieter room.

2382
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,350
Give a grown woman her privacy, you idiot.

2383
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,270
Let's go. The Tea Party will take place on the roof.

2384
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:47,320
At last, Germa 66 will have
Big Mom's power on our side,

2385
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,490
and will rule the North Blue again!

2386
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,450
You're in a good mood.

2387
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,910
But most importantly... Hey!

2388
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,230
Sanji hasn't run away, has he?

2389
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,920
Both the groom and the bride are fully prepared.

2390
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,180
What are you thinking, Sanji?
Why didn't you escape?

2391
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,340
You know what's going to happen.

2392
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,980
I'm depressed.

2393
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,270
What's wrong?

2394
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,940
Are you nervous?

2395
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,230
I don't think so!

2396
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,160
Pudding's Room

2397
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,700
I don't want to get any blood on me, after I kill that dumb Sanji.

2398
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,490
And in order for everyone to continue to see me as a good girl, I'll have to erase everybody's memories.

2399
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,520
When I think about all that...

2400
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,130
It sounds like a pain in the ass!

2401
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,640
{\an8}Everyone has their own objectives...

2402
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,440

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,750
It smells good.

2453
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,460
Please come in.

2454
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,540
This place always looks so delicious-nen.

2455
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,730
Welcome, guests.

2456
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,190
Hi, Smoothie.

2457
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,630
Would you like a welcoming drink?

2458
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:26,690
Today, we have a little bit of Mt. Mauri Lava,
a beautiful woman who stabbed a thousand men,

2459
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,350
and a giraffe that makes funny sounds.

2460
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,160
– l'll have a cup of the giraffe.
– Me too.

2461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,150
Okay. I'll squeeze it now.

2462
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,450
That's hilarious!

2463
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,580
Here you go.

2464
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,060
It tastes so good. And it's smooth to drink, too.

2465
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,800
Open up!

2466
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,620
I refuse to be searched!

2467
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,870
Outside the Tea Party

2468
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,410
No, you can't do that, Mr. Jigra.

2469
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,030
Let go of me!

2470
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,300
I said let go of me!

2471
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,480
Organ Dealer Jigra

2472
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,480
Is Big Mom already inside?

2473
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,540
See, I had an invitation from the last tea party.

2474
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,580
But sadly, I was unable to attend.

2475
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,160
Because I had to attend my mother's funeral!

2476
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,920
I wrote my reasons in a letter,

2477
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,300
but guess what Big Mom sent me in response?!

2478
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,010
It was my hospitalized father's...

2479
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,620
Hey! Who shot?! He's a guest!

2480
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,320
You are...

2481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,100
One of the Three Sweet Commanders

2482
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,000
Big Mom Pirates

2483
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,010
Second Son of the Charlotte Family

2484
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,000
Second Son of the Charlotte Family

2485
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,970
Bounty: 1,057,000,000 Belly

2486
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,560
Sweet Commander Katakuri!

2487
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,770
Why did you shoot him?!

2488
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,530
This is what he was going to say:

2489
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,880
"Guess what Big Mom sent me in response?!"

2490
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,990
"It was my hospitalized father's head."

2491
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,580
"I'm here today to get revenge."

2492
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,710
"Open the gate."

2493
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,790
Bang.

2494
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,840
Bang, he shot.

2495
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,550
Two of your men would've been shot.

2496
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,760
Is it wrong for me to throw a
 jelly bean at him before that happens?

2497
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
Rook Bege.

2498
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,220
Tell Mama that I made the decision.

2499
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,650
This is what you're gonna say now:

2500
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,270
"I see."

2501
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,740
"Alright then."

2502
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,570
He'll be the biggest pain in the ass at the party.

2503
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,190
His Observation Haki is so good, that he's able to see slightly ahead into the future.

2504
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,260
His bounty is over a billion.

2505
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,500
He's a monster!

2506
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,820
I see. Alright then.

2507
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,440
It's about time.

2508
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,380
It's time for the Tea Party.

2509
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,220
Everyone! Thank you for coming all this way!

2510
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:53,820
Wherever you look, all you see is sweets!

2511
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,910
Eat!

2512
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,790

2513
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,430
And enjoy the party to your heart's content!

2514
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,470

2515
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,580
that'll take place here!

2516
