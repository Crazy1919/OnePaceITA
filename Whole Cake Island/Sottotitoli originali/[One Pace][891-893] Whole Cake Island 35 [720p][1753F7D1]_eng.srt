00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,600
I understand your frustration.

1611
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,340
You tried to get up and I didn't let you.

1612
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,420
You tried to throw a left punch, so I hit your left shoulder.

1613
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,950
You tried to throw a right punch
so I hit your right shoulder.

1614
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,990
All of this shows that you're just an idiot
who can do nothing but feel frustrated.

1615
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,920
That's how it is when your every move is easily predicted.

1616
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,380
But... I don't want to just make you feel frustrated...

1617
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,620
Whether it's a left kick or a right kick...

1618
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,820
I'll hit you before you can do anything.

1619
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,200
And I'll keep it up until your heart bursts in half.

1620
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,220
Every attack has an intent.

1621
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,810
And a presence.

1622
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't just attack blindly, Luffy!

1623
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
Take this!

1624
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,790
As I thought...

1625
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,840
he's beginning to see the future
in the same way I do.

1626
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,530
Oh, shoot!

1627
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,160
At Sea - Bege's Ship

1628
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,430
What's wrong?

1629
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,950
I forgot to pipe roses of whipped cream...

1630
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,580
on the top of the cake!

1631
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,740
I'll do it!

1632
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,380
Give me a pastry bag!

1633
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,160
Yes, sir!

1634
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,490
Sky Walk!

1635
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,680
Amazing!

1636
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,470
So beautiful!

1637
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,930
All right! It's finished!

1638
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,920
Yes!

1639
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,770
Finally!

1640
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,940
The ultimate wedding cake, that will stop Big Mom, is finished!

1641
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,450
It smells so good...
It's making me feel faint-rero.

1642
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,990
I don't know what else to say!

1643
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,640
We didn't even need to add any poison!

1644
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,810
I hope Big Mom will drop dead
from deliciousness!

1645
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,550
Great! We made it in time!

1646
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,970
Pudding-sama!

1647
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,150
What?!

1648
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,510
Hey, are you guys okay?!

1649
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,730
The cooks are collapsing one after another!

1650
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,970
They must have worked too hard!

1651
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't stand up again.
We know your plan.

1652
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,400
"Cacao Island at 1 a.m.".

1653
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,340
But of course, your friends will be wiped out before they even get close to Cacao Island.

1654
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,750
They will be greeted by my younger brothers' fleets.

1655
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,630
It'll be the same for you, even if you do manage to get out of here.

1656
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,880
But...

1657
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,340
I'll definitely... make it through the mirror!

1658
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,480
Why are you talking like you'll succeed?

1659
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,860
Pudding-chan! Chiffon-chan!

1660
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,460
I couldn't have done it without your help.
Thanks!

1661
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,670
With this cake...

1662
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,130
I can save my friends for sure!

1663
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,710
How can you be so sure?!
Sure, the cake is done...

1664
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,520
but your friends could be dead already!

1665
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,890
Even if they're alive, you don't know whether Mama will like the cake or not!

1666
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,760
Its a waste of time to transport 
this crappy cake, Sanji...

1667
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,450
...san!

1668
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,620
That's not what you meant to say, Pudding!

1669
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,660
Oh! No, I didn't mean it!
What am I saying?!

1670
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,150
In any case, I've got to get going...

1671
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,710
Wait!

1672
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,630
Wedding cake!

1673
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,530
Rumble! Monster Point!

1674
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,350
I will stop her!

1675
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,310
What the hell is that?!
Are there only monsters on that ship?!

1676
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,360
Napoleon! Extend yourself!

1677
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Yes, Mama!

1678
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Chopper, Brook, Jinbe!
If we can hold out here, then...

1679
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,530
Yeah, I know!

1680
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,740
You don't need to say it.

1681
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
Mm-hm!

1682
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,960
Until that moment comes,
endure it no matter what!

1683
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,160
I'll bring the best cake ever
to stop Big Mom...

1684
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,510
I'll send you flying...

1685
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,850
and make it through the mirror.

1686
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,140
Because they...

1687
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,480
believe in me!

1688
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,940
I'll cut you in half!

1689
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,700
Cloven Palm!

1690
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,580
Chopper!

1691
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,120
Gust Sword!

1692
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,420
Soul Parade!

1693
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,760
Cognac!

1694
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,140
Stop!

1695
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,990
Chopper! You can't fight anymore!

1696
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,040
I've got no choice! Come on, Big Mom!

1697
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,600
At the very least, I can drag you down with me into the sea!

1698
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,430
You're full of spirit.

1699
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,210
Then, do you think you'll be able to take me on after this?

1700
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,070
No... way...

1701
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,870
At that size, even seawater won't help us!

1702
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,000
So... that's the soul of an Emperor!

1703
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,430
Now, try to get away as far as you can!

1704
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,640
If nothing is done,
we'll get burned up along with the Sunny!

1705
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,530
Even though we made it this far!

1706
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,400
And Sanji-kun should be here any moment now!

1707
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,240
That was fun, you lot...

1708
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,690
Now, give me the cake...

1709
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,960
What is this...

1710
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,170
delicious smell?

1711
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,830
Don't stand up again! You stand no chance!

1712
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,430
This fool's Observation Haki is
getting as good as mine!

1713
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,740
I have to get rid of him soon,
or something unexpected could happen!

1714
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,530
Mochi...

1715
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,250
Thrust!

1716
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,090
That ship...

1717
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,290
Guys!

1718
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,040
A ship is here!

1719
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,630
It's got the cake onboard!

1720
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,510
Sanji-kun and the others
baked the cake and came back for us!

1721
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,480
Oh, Sanji!

1722
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Sanji-san!

1723
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,890
Mama!

1724
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,480
It smells so sweet!

1725
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,870
There it is, Black Leg. It's your ship!

1726
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,250
That damn Prometheus.
He's gotten huge because of Big Mom's soul!

1727
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,580
And riding on top of the giant Prometheus,
I see Big Mom-rero.

1728
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,590
Father! Beyond them, it's...

1729
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,210
Perospero and...

1730
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,590
Bavarois...

1731
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,050
along with Smoothie and the others!

1732
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,310
They're being chased by
quite a troublesome fleet!

1733
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,900
Their ship's taken heavy damage, too!

1734
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,250
Man your positions, men!

1735
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,690
Yeah!

1736
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,710
We're up against Big Mom!
Keep your guards up!

1737
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,450
But if you see an opening,
fill her with bullets!

1738
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,260
Yeah!

1739
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,260
Rero!

1740
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,090
Nami-san! I'm here to save you!

1741
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:32,650
Anyways, Big Mom and Perospero have to have been chasing them for hours...

1742
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm impressed that they survived! Especially without a captain to lead them!

1743
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,890
Nami-san!

1744
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,440
There's someone on the bow!
Do you feel that weird aura?!

1745
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,740
Well, it isn't Haki...
Why are they on Bege's ship?

1746
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,010
Hm? Someone's dancing on the bow of that ship!

1747
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,990
Who cares about that?!
The cake is what matters!

1748
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
Lick!

1749
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,050
They definitely recreated the wedding cake
that we saw at the wedding!

1750
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,340
If Mama likes how it tastes,
her Hunger Pangs will end! But...

1751
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,220
Bege is there!
That cake has to be poisoned!

1752
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,720
What should I do?!

1753
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,110
Thanks to that sweet smell,
she's stopped attacking us...

1754
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,380
I thought...

1755
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,490
we were going to die...

1756
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,370
Should we destroy that cake?!

1757
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,150
No, if we do that, there will be
no stopping Mama's Hunger Pangs, and...

1758
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,010
this country will be annihilated!

1759
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,560
Oh... but, if she eats the poisoned cake and dies...

1760
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,810
it'll be the end for both this country and our pirate crew!

1761
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,930
What should I do?!
Which option should I choose?!

1762
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,050
Hey, Black Leg!

1763
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,590
We held up our end of the deal!
Now we'll take the cake.

1764
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,940
As promised, we won't do a thing until Mama eats it and is full.

1765
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,570
But...

1766
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,910
after that, we're free to do whatever we want, got it?!

1767
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,400
Do whatever you want. Our mission was to
calm Big Mom down using this cake.

1768
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,820
We can stop her!

1769
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,300
We're ready, Sanji!

1770
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,280
...san!

1771
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm coming!

1772
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,420
You better hurry up if you don't want to die!

1773
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,200
Pudding!

1774
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,600
Take care of yourself!

1775
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,090
Are you happy now?

1776
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,130
Yes, very...

1777
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,600
Goodbye, Sister...

1778
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,440
Rabiyan! Super Express!

1779
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,570
Go fast enough so that Big Brother Peros
and Big Brother Bavarois don't notice us!

1780
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,490
Okay!

1781
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,580
My wedding cake!

1782
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,370
There it is!

1783
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,960
I finally found it! Let's go!

1784
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,090
Yes!

1785
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,260
Mama!

1786
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,350
Wedding cake!

1787
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,160
Here she comes! To starboard!

1788
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,890
Yes, sir!

1789
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:37,350
Full speed to the southwest!
Head towards Liqueur Island!

1790
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,610
Lick?

1791
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,240
Perospero-sama!
The ship with the cake has changed its course!

1792
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
Why?!

1793
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,490
Mama is being lured by the cake
and has started chasing Bege's ship!

1794
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,600
Straw Hat's ship and Bege's ship...

1795
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,260
By splitting up,
they're trying to divide us...

1796
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,790
Lick!

1797
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,670
Yo! I'm back!

1798
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,650
Sanji-kun!

1799
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,590
Sanji-san! Pudding-san!

1800
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,370
Sanji!

1801
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,800
We were barely hanging on!
I thought we were done for! Thank you!

1802
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,250
I'm glad that you're okay!

1803
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,440
Thump!

1804
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,650
I love you, too! Nami-san!

1805
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,500
By the way, Sanji-san,
why were you on Bege's ship?

1806
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,440
It's a long story...

1807
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,410
Where is Bege's ship heading?

1808
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,580
We don't know what Mom will do
after she eats the cake...

1809
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,880
so they're taking the cake
to the nearest island.

1810
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,400
What? So they decided to be bait?!

1811
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,030
Why are they doing that?!

1812
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,910
They haven't given up on killing her.

1813
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,180
I see. That sounds just like Bege.

1814
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,110
This ship's safety is the only thing
that matters to me.

1815
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,960
It'll be great if they can lure Mom away.

1816
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,190
In any case...

1817
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,710
Our ship has taken a lot of damage...

1818
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm sorry. I should've done better...

1819
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,040
What are you talking about, Jinbe?!
If it weren't for you, we probably would have...

1820
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,650
Let's talk about it later.
I'm really glad that you're okay.

1821
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,710
By the way,
where are Pedro and Carrot-chan?

1822
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,200
Um...

1823
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,440
Oh, th-they're sleeping inside!
They both got exhausted from fighting...

1824
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,730
Brother Peros, what should we do?!

1825
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,190
Straw Hat's ship or Mama,
which one should we chase?!

1826
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,650
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

1827
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,650
Clank.

1828
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,110
This is... Bege...

1829
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,830
Bege! You bastard! What are you up to?!

1830
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,880
And why is the cake on your ship?!

1831
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,180
We'll deal with Mama's Hunger Pangs...

1832
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,160
and we'll let her eat the cake
and then make sure she's comfortable.

1833
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,590
Don't lie, you traitor!
What did you put in the cake?!

1834
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,250
We didn't put anything in it. You know Pudding made the cake, right?

1835
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,300
Oh, yeah! Where's Pudding?!

1836
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,080
You don't need to worry about
Mama or Pudding right now.

1837
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,660
Just relax and focus on the Straw Hats.

1838
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,980
You son of a-

1839
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,880
Clank.

1840
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,150
Hey, Bege!

1841
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,950
Let's chase Bege, Bavarois!

1842
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,860
What?!

1843
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,990
Look at them! I'm one-hundred percent certain
that they're scheming to kill Mama.

1844
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,950
And Pudding might be dead!

1845
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,750
But Brother Peros!
What about the Straw Hats' ship?!

1846
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,900
They'll sink at Cacao Island anyway! Also...

1847
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,210
Ring, ring, ring...

1848
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,340
Who do you think is also chasing the Straw Hats' ship?

1849
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,690
Ring, ring, ring...

1850
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,340
Ring, ring, ring...

1851
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh, yeah!

1852
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,170
Answer!

1853
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,910
Ring, ring, clack.

1854
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,910
Are you still chasing the Straw Hats' ship,
Smoothie?!

1855
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,400
Charlotte Smoothie - 14th Daughter of the Charlotte Family
(One of the Three Sweet Commanders)

1856
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, I am, Brother.

1857
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,460
You guys keep chasing the Straw Hats' ship!

1858
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,370
Bavarois and I are going
to chase Bege and Mama!

1859
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,670
Squeeze every last drop of life out of them!

1860
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,920
Torment them
and plunge them into an abyss of fear!

1861
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,580
Roger that.

1862
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,800
Clank.

1863
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,140
He should've just let me handle it
from the beginning...

1864
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,180
Brother Peros is getting distracted...

1865
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:59,400
Charlotte Citron - 15th Daughter of the Charlotte Family

1866
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,980
It would've been much easier
to stay on Cacao Island...{\an8}

1867
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,400
eating chocolate and drinking tea...{\an8}

1868
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,800
They're so impatient. Men are such idiots.

1869
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,750
Charlotte Cinnamon - 16th Daughter of the Charlotte Family

1870
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,210
Well, don't say that.

1871
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,180
Everyone, prepare to fight!

1872
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,040
Before they reach Cacao Island,
we'll sink the Straw Hats' ship!

1873
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,900
Yeah!

1874
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,590
Mm-hm!

1875
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,410
Mm-hm!

1876
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,690
They know where we're meeting Luffy?!

1877
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, it's probably surrounded 
by ships waiting to ambush us.

1878
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,810
Oh, no...

1879
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,650
Oddly enough... they seem to be acknowledging us as strong opponents.

1880
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,700
Cacao Island will be our final and biggest challenge!

1881
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,470
We'll rescue Luffy no matter what
and escape this territory.

1882
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,790
But... if we fight their fleet head-on, we're bound to lose.

1883
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,380
What's with that pitiful look?!

1884
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,220
I can't believe you slipped...

1885
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,230
Straw Hat!

1886
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,210
My plan is going well!

1887
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,920
Big Brother!

1888
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,840
Cling!

1889
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,250
To tell you the truth, I was the one who...

1890
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,700
Oh, I didn't know that, Flampe!

1891
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,140
You're such a thoughtful, well-behaved girl!

1892
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,750
That's my most-beloved sister.

1893
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,820
Oh, I'm so commendable! And so cute!

1894
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,510
That one moment of carelessness...

1895
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,930
will be the deciding factor in this fight!

1896
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,160
Why did you lower your guard?!

1897
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,350
Mochi Anemone!

1898
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,360
What's the matter, Straw Hat?!

1899
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,250
Just as I began to think highly of you...

1900
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,270
you decided to disappoint me!

1901
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,690
I think I saw it!

1902
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,190
Or was it my imagination?

1903
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,970
That's fine.

1904
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,000
Because beyond that imagination is Observation Haki!

1905
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,010
You have to be able to
sense it instinctively!

1906
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,730
Instinctively?!

1907
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,620
He stood up again!

1908
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,540
What's with those wobbly legs?!

1909
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,590
All right! Another shot, then!

1910
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:31,260
This time, I'll shoot a Numbing Needle
that's 10 times more effective than the last one!

1911
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,280
You're just a monkey who doesn't know when to give up.

1912
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,500
Drop dead already!

1913
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,090
Numbing Needle!

1914
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,300
What? He dodged it! That was my silent needle!

1915
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,180
But he fell anyway!

1916
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,920
Flampe-sama! They'll hear us!

1917
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,930
B-But the way that monkey stands up...

1918
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,100
It reminds me of a newborn fawn!

1919
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,530
So wobbly!

1920
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,260
Come on, don't make us laugh, too!

1921
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,730
There, look!

1922
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,950
He's so lame! 
Even though he's super weak and covered in blood...

1923
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,550
he gets up again and again!

1924
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,890
He wobbles up... then gets knocked back down!

1925
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,020
And then wobbles his way back up again!

1926
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,650
Flampe?

1927
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,740
Don't tell me...

1928
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,470
Big Brother is looking this way!

1929
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,600
He's so perfect and so cool!

1930
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,940
Oh, Katakuri-sama is coming this way!

1931
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,880
What?!

1932
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,990
Well done! You're such a well-behaved girl, Flampe...

1933
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,390
There, there.

1934
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,450
He's going to praise me!

1935
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,540
I'm not ready for it yet!

1936
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:32,170
I see. It was you, Flampe.

1937
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,510
You stopped him with your
favorite silent blowgun.

1938
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,300
In such an intense battle,
his concentration suddenly broke...

1939
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,900
I thought it was strange...

1940
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,150
Mochi...

1941
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
Thrust!

1942
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:07,500
But I still attacked him in his moment of weakness, pierced his stomach, and inflicted a fatal wound!

1943
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,880
Do you think... that I want to win like that?!

1944
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,590
Look at that, Flampe-sama!
The fawn stood up again!

1945
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,550
Hey, don't make me laugh!

1946
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,000
His legs are all wobbly!

1947
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,820
Just like a baby fawn's!

1948
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Now, Katakuri-sama will win for sure!

1949
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,370
Of course!

1950
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,400
It's my perfect big brother's...

1951
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,780
perfect victory!

1952
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,620
Flampe.

1953
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,660
Did you do it?

1954
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,950
That's right, Big Brother!

1955
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,470
I. Did. It.

1956
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,630
I'm the most considerate and the cutest
among your sisters, right?!

1957
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,760
The perfect and world's greatest big brother's favorite will be...

1958
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,140
me!

1959
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,640
Pat my head and tell me I'm a good girl!

1960
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,730
Big Brother!

1961
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,400
What's so funny, you lot!

1962
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,680
He...!

1963
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,850
Katakuri-sama!

1964
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,580
W-Why?!

1965
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,750
Don't you dare...

1966
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,790
give unwanted support in a duel between men!

1967
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,460
Stay away for me! Don't touch me!

1968
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,840
Ouch!

1969
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,220
Katakuri-sama!

1970
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,590
If you're going to laugh at that idiot...

1971
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,310
then you'll have to laugh at me, too!

1972
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,790
So lame!

1973
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,250
Agreed! So disappointing!

1974
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,000
Come on, that's gross!
You got blood on me!

1975
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,380
What the hell is this?!

1976
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,180
You're supposed to be always noble, calm, strong
and perfect in every way!

1977
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,370
That's the person we admire!

1978
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,970
But you stabbed your own stomach...

1979
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,810
So lame!
Someone like you can not be Big Brother Katakuri!

1980
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,510
How pathetic!

1981
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,190
You look like a pelican eel!

1982
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,990
Pelican eel!

1983
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,110
Stop it, Flampe-sama!
We won't be able to hold in our laughter!

1984
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,530
Ho-hum... I'm so disappointed!

1985
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,200
Whoa, it's a pelican eel!

1986
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,570
Stay away from him!

1987
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,940
His strength is also like a monster's!

1988
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,390
Run!

1989
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,720
Hey! Say something!

1990
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,950
Hurry up and take pictures! Let's show everyone...

1991
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,380
that loser's face!

1992
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,010
E-Excuse me! I'm sorry, Katakuri-sama...

1993
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,850
Katakuri-sama, look this way!

1994
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,820
He really looks like a pelican eel.

1995
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,270
The perfect big brother that everyone admired,
Charlotte Katakuri...

1996
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,530
is dead!

1997
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,120
I'll expose you to the fan club! And to all of the islands of Totto Land!

1998
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,480
It will be known throughout the entire country!

1999
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,830
How dare you get your dirty blood on me...

2000
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,370
and threaten me... everyone's favorite!

2001
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:03,220
Now who is the perfect big brother?!
You're so uncool!

2002
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,350
I'm embarrassed to even tell people we're blood-related!

2003
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,410
You ruined the Tea Party and I won't 
forgive you, either, Straw Hat!

2004
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,080
It's so annoying to even lay eyes on you two!

2005
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,630
I'll shoot highly venomous needles through your hearts now!

2006
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,520
Do it! Do it!

2007
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,010
I won't forgive you!
Both of you should prepare for what's to come!

2008
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,100
Our spectators sure are noisy...

2009
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,520
They won't be able to stay on their feet anyway!

2010
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,790
Conqueror's Haki?!

2011
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,800
That monkey can use it, too?!

2012
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,090
A weakling like him...?!

2013
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,500
