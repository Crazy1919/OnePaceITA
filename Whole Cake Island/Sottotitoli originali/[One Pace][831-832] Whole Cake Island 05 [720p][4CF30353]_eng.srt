780
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,770
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,040
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,240
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}

800
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,790
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,580
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,140
Whole Cake Island

812
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,710
Adventure in the Mysterious Forest

813
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,080
Ready to launch!

814
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,800
– I never get tired of looking at it!
– Me neither!

815
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,470
Channel 3!

816
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,720
Here it comes!

817
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Shark Submerge 3!

818
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,030
I'll take Pedro-san, then.

819
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,190
I'm sorry, Luffy!

820
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,120
I insisted on coming along,
but now I'm relying on Brook.

821
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,670
I think I can help you, Pedro-san!
Infiltration is my specialty!

822
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll get a copy of the Poneglyph at any cost!

823
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,380
Yeah, we'll be counting on you!
Brook! Pedro!

824
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,510
Once we meet up with Sanji and Pudding,
we'll be waiting for you around here.

825
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,350
We all have to be really careful!
Don't forget Pekoms' message!

826
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,150
{\an8}TURN BACK

827
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,650
Yeah, we decided to go on!
We just gotta do it!

828
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,030
– We're counting on you!
– See you!

829
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,200
Good luck!

830
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,280
See you later!

831
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,550
Okay, let's go!

832
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,530
Depth: 15 meters. Visibility: good.

833
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,170
It's going well!

834
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,880
Let's go up the river,
straight to Big Mom's castle!

835
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,460
I hope the river is deep.

836
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,060
Thank you for this!

837
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,400
Southwest Coast

838
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,150
Ya-hoo!

839
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,990
Okay, I landed!
We've arrived at Big Mom's island!

840
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,920
– I smell an adventure!
– I don't want one!

841
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,750
As soon as we find Sanji-kun,
we'll go back!

842
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,170
Hey! Sanji! Pudding!

843
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,680
We're here, as promised!

844
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't shout! The enemy will notice!

845
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,980
Hey, did you really see them, Luffy?

846
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,440
I did! I'm sure!

847
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,570
But when we looked,
they were already gone!

848
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,450
Yummy! Nami, try and eat the soil!
It's hard whipped cream!

849
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,870
Yummy!

850
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,790
You're right! It's meringue.
Is this island full of candies like the others?

851
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,130
What?! I wanna live here!

852
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,420
Around here!

853
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,810
I'm sure I saw Sanji and Pudding here,
but when I looked away, they were gone!

854
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,850
This is definitely the southwest coast.

855
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,310
And you wouldn't lie about it,
but I don't know why they would leave.

856
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,150
I wanna see Sanji already.

857
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
Oh?

858
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,630
Hey!

859
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,370
There he is!

860
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,460
– Sanji!
– What?

861
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,430
Sanji!

862
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,430
– What happened?
– Hey!

863
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
What's going on?

864
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,610
Sanji was there just now!
Why is he hiding?

865
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,480
Really?

866
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,580
Oh?

867
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,910
Sanji?

868
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,670
What? Where did he go?

869
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,640
We lost him!
But this place looks delicious!

870
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,730
It's a forest of sweets!

871
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,600
It smells so good!

872
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,100
If all three of them saw him,
it had to be him.

873
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,860
But... why would he disappear?

874
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,480
Sanji-kun...

875
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,190
Believe this, if nothing else.

876
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,200
I didn't mean to hide
anything from my friends.

877
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,910
Maybe he feels embarrassed...

878
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,170
Hey! Sanji! Come on out!

879
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,380
We're here to pick you up!

880
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,670
Sanji!

881
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,810
Okay, let's split up and search!

882
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,060
I'm going this way!
Where you see a bunch of cakes!

883
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,710
I'm going straight!

884
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,610
Where the sweet caramel-like
smell is coming from!

885
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,780
Then, I'll go this way!
Look at those beautiful jellybeans!

886
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,320
Wait! I don't want a secondary disaster!

887
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,920
What?! We just lost him,
so all we can do is follow our gut.

888
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,540
That's how people who get lost would think.

889
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,080
Plus, aren't you guys being motivated by
some other cravings?!

890
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,090
Some other?

891
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,470
No, we aren't.

892
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,840
Don't lie!

893
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,060
All right! I'll search with you guys!
All three of you, stay with me! Okay?

894
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,890
Mm-hm. Got it!

895
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,690
– This flower is a candy!
– Really?!

896
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,900
This is where the caramel smell comes from!

897
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,690
It's so sweet! It sticks my teeth!

898
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,430
I'm so happy!

899
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,060
Hey, guys! Do you remember?
We're here to pick up Sanji-kun!

900
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,060
You guys are too distracted by the candy!

901
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,310
I thought we were gonna look for Sanji-kun!

902
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,150
I know!

903
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,610
But there are sweets everywhere!

904
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,450
Don't you think that's strange?!
We're in the enemy's territory!

905
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,790
We'll search to some extent,
and if we can't find him, we'll go back.

906
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,410
What?!

907
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,950
Why?!

908
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,130
This green river! It's melon juice!

909
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,090
Really?! Let me try!

910
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,340
If you take a close look at this bridge,
it's a doughnut!

911
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,090
Hey! That's enough!

912
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,140
Cross the bridge!

913
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,610
Nami!

914
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,020
It's a crocodile!

915
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,250
Do you wanna take it down, Luffy?!

916
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,050
No.

917
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,260
Oh, just humans...

918
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,690
What did you think we were?!

919
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,980
That's not important!

920
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,650
The crocodile is wearing clothes and a hat
and he talked!

921
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,700
Just as I thought,
this forest is dangerous and strange!

922
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,080
If that surprises you, take a look at us.

923
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,170
Well, I know what you mean, but...

924
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,180
I think we'd better trust Pudding
and wait by the sea!

925
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm sure she'll bring Sanji-kun!

926
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,150
And look!
Our road back is already problematic!

927
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,900
We'll be fine. If we jump over
the river, we can always go back.

928
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
What?

929
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,700
What?

930
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,420
What?!

931
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,130
There's another Luffy?!

932
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,130
What?!

933
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,880
Who are you?!

934
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,810
"Who are you"?! I'm Luffy!
Stop mocking me!

935
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,400
What's going on?!
Which one is the real Luffy?!

936
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,530
They move and talk exactly the same!

937
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,490
No, they're a bit different!

938
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,040
Like a mirror-image, his scar and accessories
and everything are inverted.

939
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,590
It really looks like there's a mirror!
Who is that?!

940
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,130
Who are you?!

941
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,050
She's asking who you are!
Answer her, you idiot!

942
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,260
There he is! I found Sanji!

943
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,060
There! Up in the tree!

944
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,270
Hey! Sanji!

945
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,490
Get out of my way, you fool!

946
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,570
Sanji-kun, what are you doing up there?!

947
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,620
Oh, he's running again! Sanji!

948
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,200
You bastard! Outta my way!

949
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,760
Damn! You guys, go ahead!
Chase him!

950
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
O-Okay!

951
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm coming too!

952
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,730
Don't get separated!
Chopper! Carrot!

953
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,680
This forest is strange!
Something's gonna happen again!

954
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,980
I know! But if we lose Sanji again...

955
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,110
Sanji!

956
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,150
Nami, go with them!

957
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,480
I'll catch up with you after I beat him up!

958
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,450
Yeah, okay!

959
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,710
Sanji!

960
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,020
Rubber-Rubber...

961
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,860
... Gatling!

962
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,700
Who the hell are you?!

963
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,550
What?!

964
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,670
Th-There's a gigantic half-buried man!

965
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,540
It's a Giant!

966
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,780
– You scared me!
– We should be saying that!

967
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,800
Are you okay?!
Who did this to you?!

968
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,950
What?

969
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,120
Your body is half-buried!

970
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,130
I'm half-buried because I want to be.

971
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,880
What?! Is he stupid?!
I shouldn't have been worried!

972
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,260
The thing is...

973
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,190
I wanna have some juice.

974
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,680
I don't care!

975
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,390
Chopper, don't take him seriously!
He'll drive you crazy!

976
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,270
Wait, wait, you guys.

977
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,230
He's saying something.

978
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,730
Ignore him!

979
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,450
I like apple juice very much.

980
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,120
– So what?!
– Don't listen to him.

981
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,770
If you go left,
there are waterfalls of apple juice.

982
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,330
I like them very much.

983
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,890
Remember what Luffy told us?
We should be looking for Sanji-kun.

984
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,260
Am I dreaming?

985
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,970
You're looking for someone, aren't you?
He came this way.

986
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,220
What?! Did he?!

987
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,810
I said "Don't take him seriously"!

988
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,400
If you get me some apple juice,
I'll tell you.

989
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,860
Okay, okay.

990
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,030
Watch out! Nami! Chopper!

991
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,130
A rabbit?!

992
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,100
No! Let's run!

993
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,250
There are talking trees and crocodiles,
and the rabbit was trying to kill us!

994
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,280
This place is weird.
Let's go back to see Luffy!

995
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,090
We still know the way!

996
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,070
But, what about Sanji?!

997
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,310
We don't know
if he was real or not anymore!

998
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,720
We finally saw each other,
but he didn't even get up!

999
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,110
He didn't say anything!

1000
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,270
Yeah...

1001
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,360
And if that's the real Sanji-kun,

1002
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,610
do you think he'd just stand by
and watch us going through this?!

1003
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,940
All right. Let's go back.

1004
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,840
The needles are...

1005
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,740
Look! The clock is like that, too!

1006
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,210

1036
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,270
I'm sorry, Bird-san!

1037
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,690
C...

1038
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,110
Crane!

1039
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,640
Randolph – The Crane Rider
The Big Mom Pirates

1040
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,750
– The weapon is...
– ... coming towards us!

1041
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,810
{\an8}Big Mom's castle, Whole Cake Chateau.

1042
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,190
{\an8}The lake behind it is called Lake Aprico.

1043
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,370
This is Germa's ship!
Requesting permission to enter the port!

1044
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,710
Go ahead!

1045
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,420
{\an8}Only the ships of Big Mom's subordinates...

1046
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,210
{\an8}or those soon to join her empire, are allowed entry.

1047
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,920
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!

1048
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!

1049
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,400
All right. Stop right there!

1050
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,870
Brace for the impact!

1051
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,250
{\an8}Germa is...

1052
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,840
{\an8}... the name of the one and only seafaring kingdom
that has no land of its own.

1053
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,120
{\an8}Several dozen of their ships
 travel independently,

1054
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,930
{\an8}but occasionally come together
to form the shape of the kingdom.

1055
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,650
{\an8}The country is ruled by the
Vinsmoke Family,

1056
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,870
{\an8}which once conquered the North Blue by force.

1057
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,940
{\an8}This is the Germa Kingdom.

1058
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,500
{\an8}Their army, Germa 66,
is still viewed as a threat in the world.

1059
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,120
{\an8}Most of its citizens are men and soldiers.

1060
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,970
{\an8}There is not a day that
they don't train themselves.

1061
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,000
Why don't you go away already?

1062
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,370
How could you say that...

1063
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,240
... to your sister that you haven't seen
for 13 years?

1064
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,750
How many times do I have to tell you?

1065
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,960
I cut ties with you guys
under no uncertain terms!

1066
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,470
You guys must be crazy
to put up a tasteless picture like this!

1067
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,850
The big incident where four kings in the North Blue
were put down.

1068
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,920
The Conquest of Four Nations.

1069
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,420
Our father's dream is to bring the North Blue
under Germa's control again.

1070
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,680
What's wrong with that?

1071
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,290
It's natural for men to be
hung up on power and fame.

1072
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,670
Why don't you enjoy being a
member of privileged royalty

1073
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,270
rather than staying in a
silly little pirate group?

1074
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,510
Screw you.

1075
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,850
Look. These 10 waiting maids
will do whatever you ask them to.

1076
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,810
Don't hesitate to ask, Prince-sama.

1077
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,270
Nice, nice!

1078
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,860
That's because you're of royal blood.

1079
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,780
If we keep sending our troops to countries in war,
we'll never run out of money.

1080
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,280
You won't have to fight at all.

1081
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,500
Don't you like the sound of that?

1082
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:49,060
We Vinsmokes have always gained
wealth through our force of arms.

1083
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,410
You have that blood in your veins.

1084
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,260
Like I care.

1085
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,210
I'm not gonna marry her!

1086
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,560
Pudding is a nice girl, isn't she?
I like her.

1087
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Generalissimo, where are you going?

1088
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,270
I'm gonna go see Sanji.

1089
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,770
Don't bother me.

1090
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,040
Father-sama, why are you here?

1091
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,670
Vinsmoke Judge – The King of the Germa Kingdom
The Generalissimo of Germa 66

1092
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,880
Are you still whining?

1093
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,300
You bastard...

1094
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,890
Oh, my son.

1095
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,690
Don't call me that.

1096
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,270
Even if I call someone "Father",
it wouldn't be you!

1097
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,910
Did you do something to Yanji?
He is quite strong.

1098
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,370
I guess I'm stronger than him!

1099
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,340
Step outside!

1100
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,920
Men should talk with their fists.

1101
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,850
The Seducing Woods

1102
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,140
Chopper! Carrot! Dodge!

1103
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,230
Okay!

1104
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,180
What's going on back there...

1105
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,220
No!

1106
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
What?!

1107
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,660
He can serve as a landmark!

1108
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,830
Oh, you guys from earlier!

1109
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,710
The field of lollipops!

1110
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,170
A little more to go until we reach Luffy!

1111
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,010
You bastard! Outta my way!

1112
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,770
– He's still fighting!
– Luffy!

1113
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,980
Let's go back to the coast!

1114
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,980
Oh? Why're you guys here?!

1115
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,780
Hurry up! I'll tell you later!

1116
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,360
This forest has a bunch of creepy traps!

1117
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,360
Okay!

1118
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,000
Somebody's after us!

1119
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Let's get out of the
forest as fast as we can!

1120
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,670
That's the river where
we saw the talking crocodile!

1121
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,700
If I remember right, as soon as we
cross the river, we can get out!

1122
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,430
Let's jump over it like this!

1123
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,140
Here we go!

1124
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,980
Wait, guys! That's not the real me...

1125
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,190
Did you say something, Luffy?!

1126
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,360
No, I didn't.

1127
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
Guys! Let's keep running
without slowing down!

1128
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,330
Okay!

1129
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,620
What happened to Sanji?!

1130
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,060
He ran away from us
and didn't come back!

1131
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,630
Something's wrong with him,
even though he sure looks like Sanji!

1132
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,090
Let's talk after we get out, Nami!

1133
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,130
Yeah! I'm glad that we still know the way!

1134
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,680
We'll reach the coast soon!

1135
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Yeah!

1136
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,180
Oh?!

1137
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,350
– Huh?
– What?

1138
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,610
What?! Why?!

1139
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,070
Oh, it's you guys again!

1140
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,330
Hey, could you pull out the thing
that's stuck to my...

1141
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,500
We just went straight back the way we came!

1142
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,580
Why are you here?!

1143
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,300
Don't yell. It scares me.

1144
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:08,010
Did you ask why I'm here?
I was here the whole time!

1145
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,820
It's you guys that left and came back.

1146
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,940
– Chopper, let's try again!
– Uh-huh!

1147
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,730
Hey! Pull out the thing
that's stuck in my head!

1148
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,570
Running through the field of lollipops...

1149
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,620
Jumping over the crocodile's river...

1150
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,510
Let's get to the coast this time!

1151
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,510
You scared me!

1152
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,810
Why do you guys keep coming back here?

1153
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,900
Again?! Even without the Log Pose working,

1154
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,070
we don't need to know the directions,
because it's one simple path!

1155
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,650
Going straight back this way...

1156
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,280
Slowly... Slowly...

1157
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,410
Oops.

1158
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,250
Flower?!

1159
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,120
What?! The trees and flowers are moving!

1160
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,750
One, two! One, two!

1161
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,420
The soil is moving and talking!

1162
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,420
What's going on?

1163
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,720
What are those things?
What's with this forest?!

1164
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,970
– They found out!
– They did!

1165
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,720
♪Flower!♪

1166
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,480
There was no path from the beginning!

1167
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,400
You finally became aware...

1168
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
... of the terror of this forest!

1169
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,240
Hey, Luffy, what are you doing?!

1170
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,660
This is the Seducing Woods!

1171
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,870
Nami! That's not Luffy!

1172
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,380
Who are you?!

1173
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,640
Who am I?

1174
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,060
We were together the whole time!

1175
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,650
No matter how many times you try,
you'll never get out of this forest!

1176
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,790
Never...

1177
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,320
Not until you die!

1178
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,480
Let go of me!

1179
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Calm down, young girl.

1180
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,620
Look at the scar on my face.{\an8}

1181
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,210
Charlotte Brûlée
The 8th Daughter of the Charlotte Family

1182
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,210
Isn't it terrible?{\an8}

1183
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,670
Who are you-teia?! A tree?

1184
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,050
I'm not a damn tree! I'm Brûlée!

1185
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,650
Brûlée?

1186
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,720
A cute rabbit and a pretty girl...

1187
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,180
How nice...
When I see those beautiful faces...

1188
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,310
it makes me want to scratch them up!

1189
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,800
