{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000

796
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000

{\an8}

800
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,790
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340

807
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340

809
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,580
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,950
Seems like there's nothing wrong.

812
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,870
Yep!

813
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm kind of hungry again!

814
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,380
Don't worry. We'll see an island soon.

815
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,000
Let me give you
some extra information while I can.

816
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,510
There are a total of 34 islands
surrounding Whole Cake Island.

817
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,930
That many?!

818
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,390
There are 34 ministers, one for each island,
to run the place.

819
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,410
They call this vast marine area...

820
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,100
... Totto Land!

821
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,950
Totto Land

822
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,590
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm, I see. I'm sorry.

823
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,720
I thought it was an enemy ship.

824
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,600
Yeah, I hijacked the ship from a pirate group.
I'll present it to Mama myself.

825
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,020
Oh!
Do you have something sweet in that ship?

826
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,360
– Of course.
– Mama will be happy then!

827
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,200
It's a surprise.
Don't report to her about that ship.

828
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,280
Oh, that's wonderful!

829
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,610
Understood! Pekoms-sama, that's very cool!

830
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,410
Look at that!

831
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,840
Bricks and houses and everything...
They're all...

832
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,720
... made of chocolate!

833
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,940
A chocolate town!

834
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,080
It's like a dream!

835
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,800
Wow! There are so many kinds
of people and animals!

836
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,970
What the...! What the...!
What's with this town?!

837
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,890
Look! Chocolate is pouring out!

838
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,950
Oh, I knew you wanted to start
with the fountain of chocolate!

839
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,560
The chocolate spout!

840
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,530
{\an8}Chocolate Bathhouse

841
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,530
"Chocolate Bathhouse"?!

842
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,110
A chocolate bath?!

843
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,370
– Chocolate clothes?!
– Can you eat them?!

844
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,760
I managed to cover for us,
but we should not stay long. Grr!

845
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,960
We gotta do what we have to do and just go...

846
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,340
Are you done?

847
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,680
Wow! This is cute!

848
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,850
Oh, Nami, you look great!

849
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,230
Thanks!

850
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,530
Hey, look! My costume looks
quite nice too, right?

851
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,730
Yeah, that's really gorgeous!

852
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,990
How's this?
Do I look like a pirate, Broo...

853
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,210
What?

854
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you want more?

855
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,220
It will take one more day to
get to Whole Cake Island, where Sanji is.

856
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,300
Go food shopping.

857
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,780
Okay! Yay!

858
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,310
Pedro, do you have binoculars?!

859
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,330
Thanks! Let's see...

860
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,310
Wow! It's so diverse here, Pekoms!

861
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,660
I see Minks, too!
It's like a wonderland!

862
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,990
Yes, that's exactly what
Mama's dream is.

863
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,320
Humans, Minks, Fish-men,
Longarms, Longlegs, Dwarfs...

864
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,270
A country where all races in the world
can live together without discrimination.

865
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,130
No, I mean everything in the world!

866
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,760
Everything in the world?

867
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Yes, that's Mama's ideal world, Totto Land!

868
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,520
Realize you're already deep
into a great territory!{\an8}

869
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,800
This island is Cacao Island, and is
ruled by the Minister of Chocolate.

870
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,450
The name of the town is Chocolat Town!

871
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,900
Chocolat Town?! What a wonderful name!

872
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,400
Everything in this town is made of chocolate.

873
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
What?! I love chocolate!
Am I allowed to eat it?!

874
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,900
Grr! In this town,
you can eat chocolate all you like!

875
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,950
Yes!

876
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,710
But be careful!

877
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,400
It's against the law to eat
the roof-tile chocolates.

878
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
Because they won't be able
to keep off rain or snow.

879
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
Window glass is the Minister
of Candy's jurisdiction

880
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,560
and construction posts are
the Minister of Biscuit's.

881
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,490
And everything else other than chocolate is
private or public property.

882
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,100
Looks delicious...

883
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,170
Hey! Were you listening?!

884
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,070
I couldn't understand at all.

885
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,530
Say, are their panties
also made of chocolate?

886
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,030
Of course, they are.

887
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,290
I can't wait to see chocolate panties!

888
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,460
We're not here to take a break.

889
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,840
Come back as soon as you
finish food shopping. Grr!

890
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll stay on the ship, since they know my face,
but I love chocolate.

891
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
Get me some!

892
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,930
Okay!

893
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, Straw Hat!

894
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,070
If you're gonna go,
stop wasting your time and put on your disguise...

895
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,700
Luffy and Chopper have
already gone to the town.

896
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,390
What?!

897
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,700
Hey, what do you think will
happen if they find out

898
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,400
I brought you guys here?!

899
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Act cautiously!

900
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,610
Don't worry!
We'll know where they are soon.

901
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,400
Somebody ate a cafe!

902
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,300
There they are!

903
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,740
Screw you!

904
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,320
If it were just the chocolate
walls they could be put back later,

905
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
but the whole cafe is gone!

906
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,690
You guys ate candies,
marshmallows, almonds and jelly beans!

907
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,900
That's a crime of Snackalism!
I need to question you!

908
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,880
Come to the station with me!

909
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,790
But, old man,
there is a good reason for this.

910
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah? Out with it!

911
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,740
It was too delicious!

912
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,420
Okay, well said, idiots!
Come with me!

913
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,900
Oh, no! They're gonna get arrested!

914
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,090
Don't make a scene, Pedro-san!

915
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,050
Wait, Chocopolice-san!

916
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Carpet! Carpet!

917
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,610
The carpet is flying...

918
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,900
Carpet! Carpet!

919
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,410
Oh, you're the... owner!

920
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,450
Oh, more trouble!
The owner of the cafe came!

921
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,710
Look what they've done to your cafe!

922
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,290
I can't believe this!

923
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,220
The Owner of the Caramel Cafe

924
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,180
Nitro the Jelly

925
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,930
Rabiyan the Carpet

926
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,520
How could you leave this much?
This isn't what we agreed to! Gee!

927
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,780
You have to finish it properly!

928
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,410
Hey, do you know her?

929
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,880
No, I don't. Who is it?

930
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,290
And what's that thing on her shoulder?

931
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,500
I thought the combination of jam and biscuits
and chocolate here was delicious!

932
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,170
Here! Try this!

933
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,310
How is it?

934
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,640
It's good!

935
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,330
Chocopolice-san, I'm sorry.

936
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,160
The cafe will be expired soon,

937
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,980
so I asked them to eat the whole building!

938
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,570
Oh, pardon me! I didn't know
they were a demolition crew!

939
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,350
Come on, guys!

940
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,330
You should've had a sign out
when you were working.

941
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,540
There were still some customers too.

942
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,880
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

943
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,960
Yes, thank you!
And I'm sorry to disturb you, everyone!

944
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,330
So it was nothing serious.

945
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,970
Oh, we were so worried.

946
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,180
Oh, yeah!

947
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,100
Congratulations on getting married,
Pudding-sama!

948
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,540
Your wedding day is approaching
and you're checking in on your cafe?

949
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,140
Don't work too much.

950
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,890
We all wish for your happiness!

951
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,780
Thank you!

952
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,330
She saved Luffy and Chopper.

953
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,500
She's so kind. I wonder who it is.

954
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,120
They're so lucky!

955
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,560
This is how fortune favors
the future Pirate King.

956
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,870
Oh?

957
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,960
Captain Pedro?!

958
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,000
You're Captain Pedro, aren't you?!
I thought so! It's been a while!

959
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,220
Why are you here?

960
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm just sightseeing. Don't tell anyone I was here.

961
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,140
O-Okay. It was a pleasure to see you.

962
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,850
You know people in this town, Pedro?

963
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll tell you later.

964
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,070
So your name is Pudding.
Thank you for helping us!

965
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,080
No, no! I'm the one who
should be thanking you!

966
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,460
Why?

967
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,580
Because you said...

968
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,540
"It was too delicious"!

969
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,050
That chocolate at the cafe is a
new blend that I came up with!

970
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,840
Did you like how it melted in your mouth?

971
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,200
I added milk to cocoa butter
and highly-pure beet sugar

972
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
and kneaded it for three days
straight at 29 degrees Celsius!

973
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,460
I don't know what you're talking about,
but it was so good!

974
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,560
It was!

975
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,900
You said it was delicious,
and it really makes me want to cry!

976
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,150
Thank you! I'm so happy to hear it!

977
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,690
Wh-wh...

978
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,490
What a nice girl!

979
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,720
Do you like making chocolate?

980
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,120
I love sweets!

981
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,660
This town smells like chocolate
and it's like heaven!

982
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,460
Even the table is chocolate!

983
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,790
It's nice to know that!

984
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,590
We really want to stay
and thank you, Pudding,

985
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,490
but we need to go...

986
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,970
Yeah? That's too bad.

987
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,180
Before you go, would you like a cup of tea?

988
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,460
I guess you have a sweet taste in your mouth.

989
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,560
Tea sounds good!

990
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,770
Okay. I'll be right back.

991
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,980
Oh, what a nice girl!
She's really a nice girl!

992
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,450
I haven't asked your name, have I?

993
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,030
I'm Luffy.

994
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,650
The future Pirate King...

995
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,240
Hey!

996
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,080
What?

997
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,080
Luffy?

998
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,760
Whole Cake Island

999
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,790
How long do we have until the tea party?

1000
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,330
Three days, Mama!

1001
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,920
Flower! Flower!

1002
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
I see...

1003
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,880
What about Germa's son?

1004
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,340
He's here, Mama!

1005
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,880
Furniture! Furniture! Furniture! Furniture!

1006
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,390
There will be a wedding!

1007
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,640
How is the cake?

1008
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,400
The wedding cake!

1009
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,150
– The design?
– Okay!

1010
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,900
– The budget?
– Don't be stingy!

1011
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,740
Ingredients must be carefully selected

1012
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:54,730
Kill the people and rob them!

1013
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,790
Eggs!

1014
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,460
I got them.

1015
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,670
Flour!

1016
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,550
I got it!

1017
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,930
Fruit!

1018
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,220
I got it.

1019
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,140
We'll make it taste good!

1020
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,640
Let's eat a delicious cake!

1021
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,770
Sweet dealings!

1022
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,900
The tea party from hell!

1023
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,280
– Is this strawberry jam?
– Or somebody's blood?

1024
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,990
I don't care either way!

1025
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,330
If you're invited, be there at any cost!

1026
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,960
A sweet moment!

1027
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,460
Sacrifices to the Devil!

1028
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,210
This is a dream land for everyone....

1029
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:52,050
All kinds of races come together...

1030
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,750
Totto Land!

1031
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,360
Mmm, I can't wait!
I heard he is here.

1032
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,320
Yes, he is here.

1033
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,700
Straw Hat!

1034
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,090
Chocolat Town, Cacao Island

1035
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,090
Luffy is...

1036
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,430
Oh, no!

1037
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,640
Now that I look closer, you look familiar!
Straw Hat Luffy!

1038
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,520
That's right! I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

1039
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
We're totally screwed.

1040
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,470
Are you people really
the Straw Hats, the pirates?!

1041
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,910
Yes, we are!

1042
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Sanji-san's comrades?! You're kidding!

1043
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,110
I'm not kidding! Sanji is our buddy!

1044
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,840
What? Do you know Sanji?

1045
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,340
What?!

1046
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,440
Are you daughter of Big Mom
who's gonna get married to Sanji, Pudding?!

1047
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,650
Mm-hm.

1048
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,280
Sanji's fiancée...

1049
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm jealous! She'll be such a beautiful wife!

1050
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,370
W-Wife?!

1051
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,870
Oh! But why?!

1052
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,580
You people aren't even Mama's allies!
How did you pass the TARTE security?

1053
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,960
Why did you come?!
Y-You're gonna be killed!

1054
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,300
You're already in Mama's territory
and she's a very scary pirate!

1055
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,330
But I know you people are scary pirates too!

1056
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,150
No!

1057
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,730
Wait! Calm down!
We won't get rough with you!

1058
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,560
Luffy, what should we do with her-gara?

1059
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,860
Don't get rough, Pedro!

1060
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,750
So you came for Sanji-san...

1061
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,750
To take him back.

1062
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,920
I knew he didn't consent,
since Mama is so self-centered.

1063
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,940
She even uses her children's weddings
to strengthen her pirate crew.

1064
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,020
We've given up on marrying someone
freely out of love.

1065
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,730
We only have two choices; give up or run.

1066
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:59,240
One of my older sisters that I loved very dearly
went out to the sea looking for love.

1067
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,780
To seek a match.

1068
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,880
Just out of curiosity,

1069
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,000
... We have heard that you're the 35th daughter
of the Charlotte Family.

1070
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,300
Does Big Mom have 35 daughters?

1071
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,600
Yes, she has 39 daughters and 46 sons.

1072
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,510
We're 85 brothers and sisters.

1073
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,470
Oh, my!

1074
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,680
Wow! That's so many brothers and sisters!

1075
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,650
We have different fathers.
Mama has 43 husbands, so we're a family of 129.

1076
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,690
What... 129?!

1077
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,360
Some of my older brothers and sisters
already have children,

1078
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,910
so if you count them in, there are more.

1079
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,210
The Big Mom Pirates consist
mainly of her blood relatives.

1080
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,920
She's true to her name – Big Mom!

1081
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,220
Have you met Sanji?

1082
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,270
Y-Y-Yes... just once.

1083
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,790
Although his eyebrows are twirly,
he is very kind and gentlemanly!

1084
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,800
Flower! Flower!

1085
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,360
Even though he's got heart eyes,

1086
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,300
he knows so much about making
sweets and taught me a lot!

1087
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,660
Flower! Flower!

1088
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,240
We like the same stuff and he's so manly!

1089
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,210
I heard his legs are black,
but he's tough and dependable!

1090
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,000
He is, isn't he?!

1091
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,500
That's not what "Black-Leg" means.

1092
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,510
You really got him! He's a great guy!

1093
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,470
D-Don't tell me you're in love with...

1094
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,770
Are you in love with Sanji-kun?!

1095
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,340
L-L-Love?! Well, I mean...

1096
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,360
Mama's decision can't be overturned.

1097
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,070
And if I marry someone, I prefer, um...

1098
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,710
I like Sanji very much too!
We're the same!

1099
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,170
No, I can't say such a thing!

1100
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,180
SHOCK!!

1101
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:25,340
This is totally unexpected!
I can't believe such a lovely girl is the bride!

1102
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,510
No wonder Sanji-san's got heart eyes!

1103
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,680
We should tie her up!

1104
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,440
She'll tell them that we're here.

1105
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,280
If they find us while we're on
one of the outermost islands,

1106
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,370
we'll never be able to get to Sanji!

1107
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,370
How could you say that, Pedro?

1108
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,140
How else can we silence her?

1109
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,130
Don't forget that she's Big Mom's daughter.

1110
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,030
Yeah, but she's scared of her mother too!

1111
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,800
That's why she'll tell her!

1112
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,470
How would you know?!

1113
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,720
You stay out of this!

1114
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,560
Excuse me.

1115
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,280
I think I can still let go of my feelings...

1116
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,910
... towards Sanji-san!

1117
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,080
People in Totto Land...

1118
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,340
give their blessings to my marriage.

1119
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,180
So do the members of the Vinsmoke Family.

1120
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,100
Mama looks forward to the wedding cake.

1121
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,820
None of us can disobey Mama's order,
so I knew I couldn't marry for love,

1122
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,440
but I've been dreaming
ever since I was a child.

1123
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,660
Wondering what my husband would be like.

1124
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,330
And then, Sanji-san came along.

1125
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,310
I was surprised,
because he was such a wonderful man.

1126
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,650
But, he actually said to me in the end,

1127
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,360
"I want to marry you, but I can't do it."

1128
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,740
"I want to go back to my friends."

1129
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,170
What?! Sanji rejected a girl?!

1130
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,630
But... it's good to know...
I knew he wanted to continue the adventure!

1131
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,550
It wasn't just him who wanted to be back,

1132
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:20,930
because you all actually came here
to take him back at the risk of your lives.

1133
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,600
Even if this is Mama's decision,

1134
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,150
it'd be hard for me to stay with someone
who didn't want to get married.

1135
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,910
And most of all, I know you all
care about Sanji-san very much,

1136
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,200
and I can't take him away from you.

1137
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,130
He said he wanted to go
back to his friends too.

1138
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,050
Then all I can do for him
is help him with that.

1139
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,010
Take this route.

1140
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,560
This is the only way you can get there

1141
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,720
without Mama finding out. 
Only we siblings know about it!

1142
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,930
Is that where Sanji is?

1143
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,860
If you go along this route,
you can get to Whole Cake Island.

1144
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,730
But Mama won't let go of Sanji-san.

1145
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,700
So let's meet up at the southwest coast of
 Whole Cake Island tomorrow.

1146
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,080
I'll promise to bring Sanji-san there.

1147
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,290
I'll cooperate with you!

1148
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,900
Is it okay?
Won't you get punished by Big Mom?

1149
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,420
I'm her biological daughter.
Don't worry.

1150
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,380
You're in enemy territory.
Worry about yourself.

1151
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,760
Pudding...

1152
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,850
But is it really okay?

1153
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,400
Sanji-san and you all care about each other.

1154
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,150
Pudding-san, you're so...

1155
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,860
It's a bit of a shame,
but my next husband to-be...

1156
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,040
... could be someone even nicer!

1157
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,460
H-How wonderful this girl is!
Is she really the Emperor's daughter?!

1158
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,670
Thank you, Pudding!

1159
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,510
You're welcome!

1160
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
Pudding-sama, we're here to pick you up.

1161
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,430
One moment!

1162
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,060
I'm working now, so wait a second.

1163
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,060
You need to stop working until the wedding,
Pudding-sama.

1164
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,950
But I have customers...

1165
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,910
You have to prepare for the wedding too.

1166
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,250
Oh, it's you! The groceries
that you ordered are ready.

1167
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,090
They're there, so just take them.

1168
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh, there they are!

1169
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,080
Can you carry them?

1170
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,180
Thanks. We'll be fine!

1171
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,620
Choco-burger?!

1172
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,640
Don't look at other stuff!
Let's go! Pekoms is waiting for us!

1173
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,690
I want the choco-burger, Nami!

1174
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
– Choco-pasta.
– Choco-fried chicken.

1175
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,530
We have enough food! Come on!

1176
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,200
Oh?

1177
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,030
Pekoms?

1178
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,520
Did you find him?

1179
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
No!

1180
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,720
This is strange.

1181
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,120
Doing number two, maybe?
What about the bathroom?

1182
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,250
Hey!

1183
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,300
There is a message in the bathroom!

1184
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,310
"Turn back"?

1185
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,240
– Did Pekoms write this?
– Who else would do that?

1186
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,860
Did somebody invade?

1187
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,090
Has Pekoms been abducted?

1188
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,820
Maybe they've found out about us.

1189
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,570
In any event, this is serious.

1190
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,990
{\an8}Turn back

1191
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,520
"Turn back" means if we don't turn back,
something's gonna happen.

1192
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,300
Yeah.

1193
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,580
Okay, everyone, keep that in mind!

1194
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,260
Let's keep going!

1195
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,510
What?

1196
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,180
This is getting exciting!

1197
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,150
Broc Coli Island, New World

1198
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,480
Damn!

1199
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,260
– All done?
– Yes, sir.

1200
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,200
Okay, let's go.

1201
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,080
How dare you kill my wife?

1202
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,660
How dare you kill my children?

1203
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,250
How dare you destroy my country?

1204
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,840
You're Germa, aren't you?!
You guys are not human!

1205
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,090
Wall.

1206
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,990
I can't believe it took four hours.

1207
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,610
I have to attend my brother's wedding.

1208
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,330
I have no interest in your family.

1209
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,290
Nor your war for that matter.

1210
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,930
It's finished.

1211
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:33,560
How could a war between such
weak countries last two years?

1212
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,770
– The commission?
– I got it.

1213
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,660
– Thank you!
– Thank you!

1214
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,640
Our country has been saved.
Did we ask demons for help?

1215
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,260
No, we didn't! They're angels!

1216
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,260
Drop your weapons!
The war is over! It's over!

1217
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,640
Thank you, Germa!

1218
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,980
Germa 66! Hurray!

1219
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,280
Germa! Germa! Germa! Germa!

1220
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,160
The wedding is in three days.

1221
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,840
Two days is enough
to get to Whole Cake Island.

1222
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,160
What about Sanji?

1223
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,380
He's already here.

1224
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,090
Oh, great. I can't wait to see him.

1225
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,300
Yeah, right!

1226
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,320
See you in two days.

1227
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,380
Clank.
