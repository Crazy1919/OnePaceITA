Screw that little rabbit...

1611
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,300
Let's go, Genie!

1612
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,810
Did you call for me, Master?!

1613
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,610
That little rabbit... I'm gonna chop her up!

1614
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,070
Time to show you...

1615
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,780
what we can do!

1616
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,540
Daifuku-sama! You're putting us in danger!

1617
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,710
What are you aiming at, Genie-san?

1618
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,510
I won't let you get away!

1619
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,930
Come this way!

1620
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,020
How annoying!

1621
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,270
Genie-uine Rage Split!

1622
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,860
Please stop! Daifuku-sama!

1623
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,400
That little...

1624
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,740
That rat! She stole another helm!

1625
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,910
That crafty little rabbit!

1626
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,580
She's jumping from ship to ship and is making them attack each other!

1627
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,920
She sure is something...

1628
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,970
Yeah! She's awesome, right?!
She's like a little sister to me!

1629
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,980
When the moon cycle and the weather
are in their favor...

1630
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,560
the Minks are quite strong.

1631
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,930
The moon cycle and the weather?

1632
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,460
Mm-hm...

1633
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,990
It is said that when the Minks gaze at a full moon on a clear night...

1634
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:36,040
their feral instincts are awakened from the depths of their memories.

1635
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,950
That white, beastly form is known as...

1636
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,830
The Moon Lion, Sulong!

1637
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,120
Sulong?!

1638
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,600
Originally, the transformation made them lose their minds and attack everyone in sight...

1639
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,830
so it was quite troublesome.

1640
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,750
For both other people... and themselves.

1641
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,430
For themselves? What do you mean by that?

1642
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,480
If a Mink is unable to control it, they willl get exhausted after a single night...

1643
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,630
and die.

1644
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,640
What?!

1645
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,860
Die?!

1646
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,700
So it's a double-edged sword... It's a combat technique that could cost them their life.

1647
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,120
Carrot-san... stealing the enemy helms is truly a genius strategy.

1648
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,090
With that in mind, I will provide assistance until we are close enough to fight, too!

1649
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,530
Provide assistance?

1650
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,470
Won't you fall into the sea?!

1651
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,680
Don't worry about me...

1652
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,570
That's right! He can run on water...

1653
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,900
because he's so light!

1654
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,520
Let's leave the securing of our escape route to the two of them, and keep moving forward at full speed!

1655
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah!

1656
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
Mm-hm!

1657
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,450
Stop right there!

1658
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,610
Dodge to the left!

1659
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,200
To the right!

1660
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,870
Sluggie-gie!

1661
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,930
Prometheus...

1662
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,980
Zeus...

1663
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,680
Mama?

1664
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,780
Brother Peros!

1665
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,330
Mama's acting strange!

1666
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,510
Lick. Yeah, I know!

1667
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,490
She's getting skinnier and is having a hard time breathing!

1668
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,990
Prometheus... Zeus...

1669
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,080
Napoleon!
What happened to Zeus and Prometheus?!

1670
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm calling them over now!

1671
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,130
It's been almost eight hours since she started having her Hunger Pangs!

1672
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,580
We've never had a problem stopping them before...

1673
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,620
and I've never seen Mama this hungry.

1674
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,910
Even we have no idea
what will happen to Mama.

1675
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,660
She's truly an unknown monster now.
Lick.

1676
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,540
Will she make it to Cacao Island?

1677
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,310
By the way, Brother Peros,

1678
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,420
A report came in, saying that Pudding is currently transporting the cake this way on a ship!

1679
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,550
Oh, really?! She's our guardian angel!

1680
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,200
Well, there's a problem, Big Brother!

1681
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,270
It's true that Pudding is coming with the cake...

1682
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,650
but the ship is... Bege's, apparently...

1683
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,900
Lick? Did you say Bege?!

1684
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,550
Why is the cake that's going to save this country on that assassin's ship?!

1685
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,150
I-I don't know!

1686
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,950
What do you mean you don't know?!

1687
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:29,540
What are we gonna do now?! We can't trust that cake anymore!{\an8}

1688
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,540
Within the Territory - Bege's Ship

1689
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,390
What are you doing, Black Leg?!

1690
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,500
That's what I should be saying! Screw you!

1691
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,440
I will absolutely not let you poison the cake!

1692
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,800
This cake will definitely reach Big Mom's mouth, right?!

1693
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,110
Knowing that, what kind of idiot wouldn't add in poison or explosives?

1694
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,720
This is our opportunity to take out one of the Four Emperors!

1695
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,250
Do you realize how big of an opportunity this is right now?!

1696
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,900
Shut up! This is a battle with a cook's pride on the line!

1697
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,710
Don't interfere!
The taste alone will take care of our enemy!

1698
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,340
Huh?! Stop dreaming!

1699
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,910
Big Mom is a woman who has eaten tons of delicious snacks from around the world in her lifetime...

1700
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,640
and you think you can make a cake that will surpass her greatest imagination?!

1701
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,980
That's impossible!

1702
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,110
You're right! If that cake isn't good enough, then we're done for!

1703
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,230
But I'll take you up on that bet!

1704
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,080
Even if we do succeed,
they won't let us leave alive!

1705
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,090
Cut the crap!

1706
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,680
I guess you don't know Big Mom's history!

1707
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Mark my words, we will regret not killing her when we had the chance!

1708
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Father!

1709
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,800
What did you do to Father?!

1710
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,020
Black Leg!

1711
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,940
What did you make Father eat?!

1712
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,890
You should ask him.

1713
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,140
This cream... it's so good that I could go to Heaven right now.

1714
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,770
What?! He's about to die from the deliciousness?!

1715
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,020
Father, thank goodness-rero!

1716
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,670
Listen to me, Bege...

1717
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,550
You're free to try and assassinate her if you want...

1718
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,140
but... you can do it after I have filled the stomach of my guest!

1719
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,480
I will feed anyone who wants to eat! That is the job of a cook!

1720
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
Pudding-sama!

1721
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Why are you collapsing?!

1722
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,140
Bege! It's been a while, but even I helped with this!

1723
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,950
Believe in the power of sweets!

1724
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,380
Oh, damn...
It's like I've been hypnotized!

1725
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,050
Maybe this cake will work on Big Mom, too...

1726
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,020
Yeah... Okay...

1727
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,820
Now, let's hurry up!
Have you finished coating the cake?!

1728
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,740
Just a little more to go!

1729
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,540
Chiffon-sama!
Two of the cooks have fallen to the sweet smell!

1730
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,840
Guys! Get ahold of yourselves until it's finished!

1731
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,090
Yes, Madam!

1732
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,710
Stay safe... Nami-san, I'm on my way!

1733
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,830
Hurry up! Hurry up!{\an8}

1734
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,830
Within the Territory - At Sea - Prometheus and Zeus

1735
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,880
Which way?

1736
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,230
Straight ahead!

1737
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,920
I can feel Napoleon's presence!

1738
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,150
This is your fault, Prometheus.
You went back to eat the forest fire!

1739
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,390
Who's the one that caused me so much harm, Zeus?!

1740
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,920
I can't believe you let yourself be used by the enemy!

1741
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,510
We are special Homies that were born straight from Mama's soul.

1742
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,610
The next time you betray Mama to eat, you won't be let off so easily!

1743
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,420
I'm sorry... but... those thunderclouds were delicious!

1744
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,030
Are you really listening to me?!

1745
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,940
We can't steer the ship!

1746
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,410
We're going to be swept away!

1747
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,590
Within the Territory - The Sunny

1748
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,300
A path opened up!

1749
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,720
We can break through the enemy line!

1750
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,610
Carrot is amazing!

1751
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,450
Chopper! We have to protect the ship!

1752
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,310
Yeah!

1753
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,560
No, they're coming back!

1754
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,590
Carrot-san, wonderful!

1755
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,600
Hey! That skeleton's running on the sea!

1756
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,730
Stop him in his tracks!

1757
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,070
I must keep up with her, too!

1758
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,140
Shoot! Shoot!

1759
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,870
I'm starting to lose consciousness! I'll have to stop soon.

1760
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,430
How many ships are left?

1761
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,220
Damn that little rabbit!

1762
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,520
Genie-uine Rage Split!

1763
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,490
He-teia saved me the work!

1764
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,350
We'll get her this time!

1765
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,080
Genie...!

1766
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,450
Carrot-san!

1767
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,330
Guillotine!

1768
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,590
Go to hell, brat!

1769
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,170
I'm sorry, Pedro...

1770
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,030
Baron Corpse!

1771
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm glad that you're okay!

1772
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,440
Even though it was only a little bit of assistance... I put one of the ships over there to sleep!

1773
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,020
You've already done enough.
Let's go back!

1774
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,920
You saved me! Thank you!

1775
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,400
That's our line.

1776
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,420
How do you turn back to normal?

1777
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,860
If I block my eyes from seeing the moonlight...

1778
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,040
using a hat or some sunglasses...
or by simply closing my eyes...

1779
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,470
The moonlight from a full moon enhances our abilities!

1780
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,210
That was truly beautiful!

1781
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,060
Carrot... Are you all right?!

1782
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Yeah...

1783
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,810
Thank you!
You helped us out of a big pinch!

1784
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,940
We were surrounded by enemies
and our ship was almost sunk!

1785
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,380
I'm glad I was able to help.

1786
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,660
Can I go into a room where there's no moonlight?

1787
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,270
Of course! Leave it to us
and get some rest!

1788
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,190
Brother Peros!
Big Brother Daifuku can't fight anymore!

1789
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,380
His fleet is drifting away!

1790
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,290
How useless... Daifuku!

1791
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,550
Mama... Are you really all right?!

1792
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,340
There they are...

1793
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,310
They're coming, Mama!

1794
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,940
Zeus! Prometheus!

1795
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,480
We're on our way!

1796
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,370
Mama?! She looks like a different person...

1797
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,540
Why is she so light?!
Is it because she's so hungry?!

1798
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,540
Lick. How long has it been since I saw Mama move so fast?!

1799
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,010
Give me the wedding cake!

1800
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,660
Big Mom is coming!

1801
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,410
Napoleon!

1802
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,800
Transform into a sword!

1803
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,180
Yes, Mama!

1804
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,200
What the hell is that?!

1805
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,240
Mama...

1806
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,420
Straw Hat!

1807
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,100
No way!

1808
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
Big Mom!

1809
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,170
What has she turned into?!

1810
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,790
Where is my wedding cake?

1811
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,880
Stand back, guys!
Be prepared to abandon ship!

1812
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,840
But...

1813
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,600
Oh... I'm so hungry.

1814
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,080
But nothing else can satisfy me.

1815
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
Where is it?!

1816
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,360
Where is the wedding cake?!

1817
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,200
No! The Sunny!

1818
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,450
Oh, no!

1819
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,910
How are we going to chase off such a monster?!

1820
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,190
Wheat Island - Flour Town

1821
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,280
That scared me!

1822
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,010
Mirrors are...{\an8}

1823
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,570
Wheat Island - Flour Town

1824
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,030
If this continues, all of the mirrors in this town will be gone!{\an8}

1825
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,260
I didn't expect him to fight this long
against Katakuri-sama in the Mirro-world...

1826
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,360
Whole Cake Island

1827
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,360
We keep getting reports on mirror-breakings
from various islands.

1828
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,040
It's already 9:30 PM-soir.

1829
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,780
It's been almost 12 hours
since the assault on the Tea Party!

1830
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,420
What's going on? Dammit!

1831
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,320
Hey, everyone...
Do you wanna know something interesting?

1832
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey, stop!
Their chance of survival will lower even more.

1833
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,340
What is it, Stussy-sama?

1834
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,050
At the Tea Party, Linlin revealed...

1835
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,890
the Tamate Box from the Ryugu Palace.

1836
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,550
She got it...

1837
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,640
from Straw Hat Luffy, didn't she?

1838
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,270
So what?

1839
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,360
That Tamate Box...

1840
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,360
contained explosives.

1841
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,660
Are you sure-bon?

1842
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,490
Mirro-world

1843
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,490
Oh... he's still so perfect and cool.

1844
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,350
Big Brother Katakuri!

1845
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,370
And...

1846
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,010
haven't you gotten a
clear shot yet, sniper?

1847
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,460
Well, I've been shooting at him
without being noticed...

1848
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,470
but he's moving so fast!

1849
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,340
Damn!

1850
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,920
Geez! You're useless!

1851
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,470
So crappy!

1852
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,520
If we don't take out Straw Hat soon,
Big Brother Katakuri will bring him down.

1853
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:25,110
Everyone!
Whose head is going to be patted by Big Brother?!

1854
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,740
Of course, it's Flampe-sama's!

1855
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,490
I thought so!

1856
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,840
I have 41 older brothers.

1857
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,990
And 40 of them voted in the Best Little Sister Awards.

1858
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,920
I won!

1859
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,970
Everyone loves me!

1860
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,190
That means I'm everyone's favorite!

1861
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,730
36th Daughter of the Charlotte Family
Charlotte Flampe
Katakuri Fan Club President and Suicide Squad Captain

1862
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,640
I have to be the king of the little sisters!{\an8}

1863
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,600
So cute!

1864
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,110
Everyone wants to be Big
Brother Katakuri's favorite!

1865
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,890
But he's an icon for all
his 38 younger sisters!

1866
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,550
Even all his younger brothers admire him.
There are too many rivals!

1867
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,260
So I wanna help him now to earn some bonus points!

1868
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,360
We know how you feel, Flampe-sama!

1869
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,600
We want Katakuri-sama to like us, too!

1870
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,840
I don't care about you guys!

1871
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,190
When we got here,
he didn't seem like himself.

1872
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,620
But now he's as cool as always!

1873
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,440
I can't stand to see him having a hard time
against an enemy in the first place!

1874
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,530
He has to be perfect at all times!

1875
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,990
Or I'll be disappointed!

1876
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,500
You're right.

1877
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,960
But he's not having a hard time now.

1878
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,610
It's just that the enemy's persistent!

1879
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,100
He must've received mortal wounds
dozens of times, but he keeps getting up.

1880
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,220
What a fool!

1881
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,390
How laughable.

1882
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,520
Wedding cake!

1883
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,170
Did you hide it in here?!

1884
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,260
Wait, Big Mom!

1885
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,470
I don't see it!

1886
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,180
It's not here!

1887
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,640
Stop! There's no cake on this ship!

1888
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,020
What?!

1889
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,980
Don't be ridiculous... That can't be true!

1890
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,620
Because my son told me that it's here!

1891
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,840
If it's not here, then I'll have to take my eldest son's life with my own hands!

1892
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,220
Sh-She remembers!

1893
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,340
If you're lying to me...

1894
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,480
you'll pay with your lifespan!

1895
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,050
Just how conscious is she right now?!

1896
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,280
I thought I could get away with it!

1897
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,730
Don't you dare call my son a liar!

1898
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, Napoleon!

1899
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,330
Yes, Mama!

1900
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,420
Let's do it.

1901
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,110
Cognac!

1902
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,910
{\an8}Cognac: Type of brandy named after the town of Cognac in France.

1903
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,910
I'll burn you and cut you in half!

1904
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,210
A big flaming sword!

1905
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,460
No chance! Get away, Jinbe!

1906
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,600
Go to hell!

1907
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,670
Shark Skin!

1908
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,880
Blade of Destruction!

1909
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,540
What in the world?!

1910
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,150
He stopped Cognac!

1911
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,310
Jinbe!

1912
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,660
Don't think...

1913
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,120
you can overpower me, you damn shark!

1914
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,380
Jinbe-san!

1915
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,420
Oh, no!

1916
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,590
Jinbe!

1917
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Where is it?! Bring out the cake!

1918
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm starving to death!

1919
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
Carrot!

1920
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Stop it, Big Mom!

1921
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,240
Carrot is in that room!

1922
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,150
If you want me to stop...

1923
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,450
Nami!

1924
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,060
Tell me where it is!

1925
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,510
Nami!

1926
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,890
I'm fine!

1927
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,600
Oh, no! The sail caught
fire from Big Mom's head!

1928
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,810
Where did you hide...

1929
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,050
Run, Nami!

1930
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,270
that massive cake?!

1931
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Guard Point!

1932
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Chopper!

1933
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,780
Well, well...

1934
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,670
Look what you've turned into!
They're getting more and more exotic.

1935
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,530
I'll definitely add you to
my collection of strange beasts!

1936
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,700
You little chubby raccoon!

1937
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,650
I'm not a raccoon! I'm a reindeer!

1938
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,310
Once I get the wedding cake,
both you and Soul King will belong to me!

1939
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,210
Let go of me! The cake isn't here, and I'm not your plaything!

1940
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,400
Chopper!

1941
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,340
Oh! If Mama sinks their ship,
maybe my lie will go down with it!

1942
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,450
If the Straw Hats lose their ship,
they'll basically be done for!

1943
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,370
The ship...!

1944
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,480
The ship's burning!

1945
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,760
Rubber-Rubber...

1946
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
Hawk Stamp! 

1947
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,170
Did he try to dodge?

1948
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,260
Why won't the lights go out...

1949
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,510
in your...

1950
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,510
eyes!

1951
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:34,180
I don't understand you.
Falling down to the ground is disgraceful.

1952
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,690
The ship...!

1953
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:07,020
The ship is is burning!

1954
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:14,530
Now, where is the wedding cake?

1955
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,540
Let go of me!

1956
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,470
Chopper!

1957
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,550
What should I do? What should I do?
We have to put out the fire!

1958
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,190
Water! Water!

1959
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,380
Ocean Current...

1960
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,890
Shoulder Throw!

1961
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,590
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow...

1962
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,470
Damn! Suddenly, the water...!

1963
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,630
Jinbe-san!

1964
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,470
Mama!

1965
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,470
Get off of this ship, Big Mom!

1966
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,460
If that's what you want...

1967
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,940
then hand over the cake!

1968
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,860
Fishman Karate Secret Technique!

1969
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,370
Vagabond Drill!

1970
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,180
Mama!

1971
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,270
What?!

1972
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,210
Yay! He kicked her out!

1973
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,030
Jinbe, you're amazing!

1974
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,200
Thank goodness!

1975
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
You did it!

1976
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,330
Guys!

1977
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,630
If we allow them to damage the ship any further...

1978
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,230
how will we face Luffy and the others?!

1979
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,520
The ship cannot slow down!

1980
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,010
If Perospero and the others
catch up to us, that'll be the end of the line!

1981
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:43,650
Yeah!

1982
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,540
Okay!

1983
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,300
You can count on us!

1984
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,380
I'm sorry, but...

1985
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,470
Big Mom will regain her footing right away!

1986
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,040
How's Carrot?

1987
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,250
She's okay!

1988
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,810
Let's lose them at full speed!

1989
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,020
Mama, are you okay?

1990
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah!

1991
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,620
That wasn't so bad, Jinbe!

1992
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,410
Here she comes!

1993
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,380
Oh! I have an idea!

1994
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,430
Let's slice it up!

1995
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,840
That's a good idea, Mama!

1996
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,560
Then, I'm sure I'll find it!

1997
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,770
The wedding cake!

1998
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,400
It stretched this time!
If she swings that sword around...

1999
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,640
The ship will be finished!

2000
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,730
At least Big Mom isn't on the ship anymore!

2001
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,960
All right, Zeus-chan...

2002
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,860
You like these, right?

2003
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,780
Those are...!

2004
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,610
Black Ball!

2005
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,580
It's delicious! It's
delicious! So delicious!!

2006
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,010
Yum-yum!

2007
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,130
That's right! Now, help yourself!

2008
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,580
What should I do?!

2009
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,620
Humph! The same trick won't work twice!

2010
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,350
Don't try to fool me, you temptress!

2011
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,650
Nami!

2012
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
It's me.

2013
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,490
Oh, please!

2014
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,420
That's right... I don't have any flesh,
so lightning doesn't affect me.

2015
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,340
Oh yeah?

2016
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,470
Do you wanna fight me again, Soul King?!

2017
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:01,220
I remember that you couldn't even
scratch me with your sword before!

2018
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,840
You're right... So may I at least...

2019
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,940
see your panties?!

2020
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,760
Huh?!

2021
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,390
What?!

2022
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,610
Okay.

2023
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,080
It's done!

2024
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,570
Three-Pace Hum...

2025
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,160
Soul...

2026
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,290
Notch Slash!

2027
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,590
From the very beginning, our target was you alone, Zeus!

2028
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,930
Ow, ow, ow! Damn!
I let my guard down!

2029
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,970
Stay with us, Zeus!

2030
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,310
Positive Charge Black Ball!

2031
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,480
Discharge and feel better, Zeus-chan!

2032
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,280
You...!

2033
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,740
Th-This is...

2034
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,900
What is it?!

2035
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,310
Mama!

2036
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,670
You're kidding me, Mama!

2037
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,570
Zeus discharged!

2038
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
Mama!

2039
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,120
We did it!

2040
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,840
We bought some time!
Let's make some headway now!

2041
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,550
Hurry up, Brook!

2042
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,590
Okay!

2043
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,260
Grab this!

2044
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm back!

2045
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,290
Yay! Welcome back!

2046
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,220
Brook, well done!

2047
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,780
We tried to minimize the damage,
but it's quite bad.

2048
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,820
Oh, yeah.

2049
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I brought something back.

2050
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,920
Oh, Zeus!

2051
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,200
I-Isn't he dangerous?

2052
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,700
I don't think he has much energy left...

2053
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh, where am I?

2054
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,290
Nice to see you again, Zeus.

2055
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,100
Nice... to... see you... too...

2056
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,230
As I recall, you tried to...

2057
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,800
strike me with lightning earlier.

2058
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm sorry...

2059
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,390
If "sorry" were enough,
there would be no need for sheriffs or the Navy.

2060
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,270
I bet you got the wrong idea earlier...

2061
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:08,280
I didn't ask you to be my friend...

2062
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,140
What?

2063
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,030
I'll ask you one more time...

2064
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,870
Will you be my servant... or would you rather...

2065
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,370
die?

2066
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,990
Think about it carefully.

2067
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,010
Mama! Mama!

2068
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,720
Shut up...

2069
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,060
Mama!

2070
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,930
Chase them, Prometheus!

2071
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,550
Yes, Mama!

2072
