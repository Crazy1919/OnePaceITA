It can't be.

1612
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,440
No... No...

1613
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,410
Pedro-san sacrificed himself...

1614
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,940
If only we were... if only we were...!

1615
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,830
If only we were stronger...

1616
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,880
Our enemies are the ones who should be crying.

1617
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,350
We cannot allow ourselves to be upset.

1618
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,690
Hey, Jinbe-san!

1619
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,360
How could you say something so cruel?!

1620
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,980
Just because you spent the least amount of time with Pedro doesn't mean that...

1621
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,490
I'm just saying that we shouldn't let our guards down!

1622
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,040
We had our backs against the wall on that coastline...

1623
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,580
Pedro knew that we were in a dangerous situation, and was prepared to sacrifice himself whenever necessary.

1624
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,510
This is...

1625
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,470
Pedro's victory!

1626
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,850
How great of a loss has the enemy suffered because of your presence here?

1627
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,320
This is an unprecedented series of events for them!

1628
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,780
Your strength really drove Big Mom
into a corner!

1629
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,790
Don't you hear Pedro's voice in your ears?!

1630
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,220
"Keep going!"

1631
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,030
Luffy understood the stakes instantly...

1632
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,520
and decided to take the enemy on
all by himself.

1633
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,530
Katakuri has a bounty of over one billion! It's an all or nothing situation.

1634
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,490
But it's not over yet!

1635
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,370
We are still in Totto Land!

1636
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,750
Sooner or later, the pirate queen of this country, Big Mom, will be on our tail!

1637
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,130
And her fleet could close in on us from all directions at any time!

1638
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,130
So until we escape from Big Mom's territory...

1639
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,850
we must not let down our guard!
Don't you hear Pedro saying that?!

1640
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,090
I'm very sorry.

1641
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,930
I was way out of line.

1642
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,400
Nami, give us directions!

1643
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,450
Okay!

1644
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,280
Sanji-kun and the others will be sailing to us from Cacao Island...

1645
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,320
so we need to make sure we don't miss them.

1646
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,740
There's a strong wind coming!
It's a tailwind!

1647
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,450
So steer to starboard!

1648
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,660
Hard a-starboard!

1649
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,780
We'll catch the wind on the starboard side
and head straight west!

1650
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,300
We'll take a direct route!

1651
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,610
Roger!

1652
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,080
I'll go refill the cola we used!

1653
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,660
I'll watch for enemies!

1654
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,380
Okay!

1655
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm in position!

1656
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Uh-huh!

1657
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll help you monitor the sea currents!

1658
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,370
They're coming from six o'clock!

1659
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,710
Those are the ships from earlier!

1660
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
There's a person?!

1661
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,380
I-It can't be!

1662
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,930
Cake!

1663
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,060
It can't be.. that can't... that can't be possible!

1664
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,560
Big Mom is walking on the water!

1665
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,230
No way! That's ridiculous!

1666
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,960
It's not water... It's...

1667
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,760
candy?!

1668
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,540
She's walking on a large
blob of moving candy!

1669
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,500
Using candy?!

1670
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,130
Hey, does that mean...

1671
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,130
The only person capable of producing that...

1672
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,930
It must be... him-teia!

1673
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,640
Lick...

1674
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Candy Sea Slug!

1675
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,770
Where did Zeus go?

1676
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,650
It's his job to help Mama cross the sea!

1677
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,320
It can't be...

1678
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,200
But I suppose that's fine... because I have a score to settle with them!

1679
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,910
Pedro sacrificed his own life!

1680
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:18,110
Well, I'm able to replace my right arm with candy, but...

1681
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,210
Every time my right arm is melted...

1682
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,930
when I'm enjoying my afternoon tea...

1683
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,590
I'll remember... that Jaguar Mink's face!

1684
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,170
Isn't that right, Napoleon?
There's nothing more humiliating!

1685
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,150
It is a grievous crime in this land.

1686
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,830
The Straw Hats have no future here.

1687
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,140
How should I torment...

1688
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,100
his companions to sate my rage!

1689
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,990
Whole Cake Island

1690
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,990
Huh? Why, why, why?

1691
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,630
Everyone's gone!

1692
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,620
I really wanna eat some flames!
I'm losing my strength...

1693
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,270
I wanna eat thunderclouds, too...

1694
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,420
Within the Borders of Totto Land - At Sea

1695
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,540
Oh... So Lola-chan, who we met at Thriller Bark,
was a master at making chocolate?!

1696
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,940
That's right. Lola was the Minister of Chocolate on Cacao Island...

1697
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,480
but after she left, the position was never filled!

1698
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
Oh, how come?

1699
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,490
Because the presumed candidate here keeps rejecting the position.

1700
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,660
Isn't that right, Pudding?

1701
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,780
B-Because, to me...

1702
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,710
The only Minister of Chocolate for Chocolat Town should be Sister Lola!

1703
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,020
And I've always hoped that she would return someday...

1704
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,670
I know how you feel, but...

1705
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,720
Oh?

1706
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,960
Oh? Oh? Oh?

1707
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,260
Could I be mistaken?

1708
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,530
No...

1709
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,220
Pound - The Father of Lola and Chiffon

1710
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,220
I-I think that's my daughter!

1711
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,300
Hey! Hey!

1712
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,630
Hey!

1713
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,440
She's gone now...

1714
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,610
Chiffon...

1715
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,660
Hey! Come out from under there, Pudding!

1716
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,260
N... No way!

1717
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm wearing a wedding dress right now!

1718
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,620
If I sit on the carpet with that man...

1719
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,600
people will think that we just got married to each other!

1720
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,510
What people?

1721
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,550
You never know who's watching!
And I'll be annoyed if they think it!

1722
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,000
It.. It'll... It'll really annoy me, okay?!

1723
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,980
Sorry about the trouble. Just don't fall, okay?

1724
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,390
S-Shut up!

1725
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,700
Oh! What a sweet man!
He's worried about me!

1726
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,540
Who do you think you are?!
Whether I fall or not isn't your business!

1727
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
There's Cacao Island!

1728
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,880
All right! Let's start making the cake
as soon as we arrive!

1729
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,690
Hey! Did you hear what I said, Sanji...

1730
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
...-san!

1731
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,150
Mirro-world

1732
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,160
What an idiot!

1733
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,210
I can't believe he broke the mirror himself!

1734
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,960
Are you trying to sacrifice yourself
to let your friends escape?!

1735
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm gonna kick your ass!

1736
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't be ridiculous!

1737
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,210
Who do you think you're talking to?!

1738
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,420
Katakuri-sama has a bounty of
one billion, fifty-seven million belly!

1739
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,680
He's the strongest of the Three Sweet Commanders!

1740
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Hawk Gatling!

1741
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,830
I'm following your lead on this...

1742
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,340
Am I doing it wrong?

1743
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,240
But... it's more efficient this way!

1744
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,750
That's our Katakuri-sama!

1745
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,930
Katakuri-sama, that's so brutal!

1746
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,820
I suppose you understand now.

1747
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,750
As I already told you... in terms of ability...

1748
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,290
There's nothing you can do that I cannot.

1749
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,800
I have you beat in both speed and strength.

1750
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,680
Rubber won't lose to mochi!

1751
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,220
I'm not gonna lose!

1752
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,020
Rubber-Rubber...

1753
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,080
Hawk Stamp!

1754
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,020
Is that it?

1755
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,230
No way!

1756
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,380
He disappeared again!

1757
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,540
I knew Katakuri-sama was in a different league!

1758
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,220
So you're trying strength next?

1759
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,180
Give up already.

1760
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,090
What a huge punch!

1761
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,970
Rubber-Rubber...

1762
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,050
Elephant...

1763
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,430
Gun!

1764
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,190
Katakuri-sama has an even bigger one!

1765
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,700
Is that how you do...

1766
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,800
your Elephant Gun?

1767
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,620
Cacao Island

1768
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,570
She's so beautiful in her wedding dress!

1769
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,070
I feel bad for her.
Her wedding was ruined.

1770
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,550
But even with that sad look,
she's still so beautiful!

1771
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,620
Oh! It's the Minister of Puffs!

1772
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,250
Chi... Chiffon-sama!

1773
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,430
Everyone, don't worry!
Sister Chiffon is not the primary culprit of the revolt!

1774
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,060
The one at fault is her husband; "Gang" Bege!

1775
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,930
I'm sorry, Sister.

1776
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:32,100
I told them that I'd threaten you
and force you to help me make the cake.

1777
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,520
That's okay, Pudding.
That's the position I'm in now.

1778
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,090
Well, Pudding-sama,
I can't believe what happened today...

1779
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,100
Who could've expected such a happy wedding...

1780
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,640
to be ruined by Straw Hat Luffy's trespassing and Bege's betrayal?!

1781
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,180
That Sanji man ruined it, too!

1782
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,250
What's done is done.

1783
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,530
Pudding-sama, I'm sure you're having a hard time!

1784
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,570
Mama must be angry.

1785
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,820
Yes, she's mad and hungry.

1786
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,900
In addition, she's having Hunger Pangs and may very well destroy this country.

1787
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,700
Oh, how horrible...

1788
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,330
Is everything ready?

1789
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:25,550
Yes! About an hour ago, the 31 most renowned chefs from Whole Cake Island arrived here.

1790
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,130
Sweets Factory - Chocolat Town

1791
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,590
We've been expecting you, Pudding-sama!

1792
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,820
We're the 31 head chefs
of Whole Cake Island!

1793
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,270
We're the WCI 31!{\an8}

1794
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:59,080
Sister Chiffon and I will make the wedding cake that can stop Mama.

1795
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,780
Please help us.

1796
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,240
Yes, ma'am! We've already made preparations!

1797
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,040
Pudding-sama was the bride,
so she was affected the most by what happened...

1798
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,920
You can count on me!
I'm not gonna let Mama destroy our country!

1799
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,670
Pudding-sama!

1800
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,710
I can't believe she's overcoming the pain
and overseeing the cake-making herself!

1801
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,300
She's literally a goddess of salvation!

1802
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,600
Good luck!

1803
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,590
Go ahead and go inside with Rabiyan.

1804
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,510
Okay.

1805
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,620
Please, everyone! Listen to me!

1806
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,390
I need you to do me a favor!

1807
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,960
We're going to risk our lives and bake the cake
that will determine the fate of our country!

1808
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,240
We really need to concentrate!

1809
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,410
So, please don't look inside the factory
under any circumstance while we're at it!

1810
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, ma'am!

1811
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,720
And no matter who it is,
don't let anyone look inside!

1812
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,460
Yes, ma'am!

1813
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,620
We understand! Pudding-sama!

1814
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,680
Thank you, everyone!

1815
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,740
Good luck, Pudding-sama!

1816
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,070
This way, they won't see Sanji-san...

1817
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,050
And now, I've got to deal with the ones who will be helping us.

1818
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,620
Head Chefs! Come inside one at a time!

1819
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,330
Head chef of the First Kitchen, Buche, reporting for duty.

1820
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,040
Stay still.

1821
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm gonna modify your memories...

1822
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
Edit!

1823
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,400
Hey, let me down.

1824
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,130
Okay!

1825
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,460
Here you go!

1826
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,050
That must've been a tough ride.

1827
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,630
Inside the Factory

1828
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,430
We don't have much time, so I drew a
blueprint of the cake on the way here.{\an8}

1829
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,270
What?! You memorized it?

1830
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,650
Pretty much.

1831
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,200
No way! It's easy to remember the shape, but how could you know the ingredients without tasting it?!

1832
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,580
By smelling it.

1833
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,040
Seriously?!

1834
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,340
Now, hurry up! Every minute counts!

1835
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,970
Pudding-chan's chef outfit is so cute!

1836
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,230
What?!

1837
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,520
Pudding-sama, are you all right?!

1838
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,680
Let's do it, Husband-sama!

1839
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
Huh? Me?

1840
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,310
Come here!

1841
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
I took out their memories of the incident earlier...

1842
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,910
in other words, they think the wedding finished without a hitch, and...

1843
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,280
that w... we are... m... married!

1844
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,730
But...

1845
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,720
they think the wedding cake was ruined
by unexpected weather.

1846
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,790
And that Mama was enraged, so the cake has to be remade quickly.

1847
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,500
That is what they believe now.

1848
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,540
I see.

1849
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:12,710
Their memories of making the cake are still fresh, so they'll be useful to us!

1850
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,930
Who drew this blueprint
and recipe for the wedding cake?!

1851
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,180
Me!

1852
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,600
Husband-sama, you drew this?!

1853
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,770
Yeah. Let me know if there are any mistakes.

1854
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,370
It's perfect!

1855
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,000
You even identified the hidden flavors...

1856
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,410
that took Head Chef Streusen-sama a week to come up with!

1857
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,740
I heard rumors you were skilled, but wow, you're amazing!

1858
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,290
And by an odd coincidence, as husband and wife...

1859
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,460
Husband and wife?!

1860
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,520
..this cake will be your first project, strangely enough.

1861
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,790
Yeah, you're right. I'm a little embarrassed.

1862
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,880
Husband and wife...

1863
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,930
Are you okay, Wife-sama?!

1864
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,470
W... Wife...

1865
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,340
Wife-sama!

1866
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,740
Wife-sama! Wife-sama!

1867
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,600
Stay with us, Wif..

1868
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,310
Stop! She'll die!

1869
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,440
What?!

1870
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,060
He called us husband and wife! Oh my!

1871
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,440
Hey!

1872
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,580
What? He suddenly said "Hey" to me!

1873
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,540
Maybe it's not so bad to have an assertive husband...

1874
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,190
No, but it's important to start things right.

1875
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,500
I-If you act like my master,
I'll kill you, Sanji...

1876
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,290
I need you to gather these as fast as you can.

1877
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,100
Non-homogenized milk, sugar beets,
bananas, black sesame...

1878
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,340
roasted soy flour, yogurt.
A lot of it.

1879
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,540
Yes, sir!

1880
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,430
...san!

1881
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,640
Everyone! It's a race against time
until the cake is complete!

1882
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,370
Chiffon-chan, you bake
the giant chiffon cake.

1883
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,480
Pudding-chan,
you handle all the chocolate tempering.

1884
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,420
You have two hours and forty minutes!

1885
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,830
It certainly is a fight against time.

1886
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,540
When we get there,
I'll add my secret ingredient!

1887
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,310
It can lead anyone to the peak of happiness...

1888
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,380
I'll make you taste true sweetness!

1889
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,920
T-True sweetness?!

1890
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,490
In three hours, we'll load the incomplete cake
on a ship and leave Cacao Island.

1891
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,200
And as we let it cool down,
we'll decorate it on the ship.

1892
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,580
Before we meet up with Luffy and the others
being chased by Big Mom, on the Sunny...

1893
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,860
we'll finish making the greatest cake ever!

1894
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,280
I see. That sounds efficient.

1895
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,400
But at that fast of a pace?

1896
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,450
No matter how you look at it, that's impossible!

1897
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,840
We gotta do it!
Do you want Mama to destroy the country?!

1898
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm sorry! We'll follow you!

1899
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,110
All right!

1900
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,020
Let's start baking!

1901
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,870
For those who saved Lola!

1902
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,970
For Sanji-san!

1903
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:06,230
I'll make my special extremely-fluffy
chiffon cake!

1904
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,440
I must help Sanji-san and the others get away!

1905
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,430
With my very sweet chocolate!

1906
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,650
Keep hanging on, guys!

1907
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,170
I'll show them!

1908
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,270
My offensive cooking!

1909
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,700
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring... Clank!

1910
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,100
Mirro-world

1911
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,100
Katakuri, it's me.

1912
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,930
You managed to survive, Brother Peros.

1913
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,650
Yes, barely.

1914
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,420
That bastard Pedro...

1915
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,250
died so pathetically!

1916
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,630
Straw Hat! You were there, weren't you?

1917
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,140
I suppose he sacrificed his life to try and kill me...

1918
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,180
but I'm very much alive, as you can probably tell.

1919
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,730
So he died for no reason!
Right?!

1920
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,450
And now you're going to die in vain too,
just like Pedro.

1921
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,150
Why don't you let him kill you already?
Lick.

1922
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,670
What happened to Straw Hat's friends?

1923
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,840
Believe or not...

1924
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,520
they launched their ship into the air and escaped our encirclement.

1925
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,340
I'm chasing them with Mama now...

1926
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,300
We're walking on the water.

1927
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,220
They're tenaciously trying to flee...
but we'll catch up to them soon.

1928
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,890
Amande and the others' fleet
will be here soon, too.

1929
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,800
I see.

1930
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,390
Clank.

1931
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,100
Brûlée.

1932
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,460
Ah, Big Brother...

1933
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,390
How long do you plan on sleeping?
Our soldiers can't go anywhere if you keep doing that.

1934
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,370
Okay.

1935
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,800
I thought he might have been able to protect his crew with all of that vigor he's got, but...

1936
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
this is the current state of their captain.

1937
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,260
Take those soldiers
and go set fire or something to Straw Hat's ship.

1938
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,280
Okay!

1939
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,040
Big Sister Brûlée!

1940
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,430
We found a mirror that goes to Straw Hat's ship!

1941
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,500
Mascarpone
34th Son of the Charlotte Family

1942
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,500
Joscarpone
29th Daughter of the Charlotte Family

1943
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,500
There must be one or two more!

1944
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,170
All right! Let's shoot flaming arrows
at Straw Hat's ship!

1945
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,970
I hope they taken out by Mama
while in a frenzy from the fire.

1946
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,760
Yikes!

1947
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,230
Give me that mirror!

1948
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,520
Leave them alone!

1949
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,680
I thought you wanted to have a one-on-one duel with me, Straw Hat.

1950
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,300
That's what you get!

1951
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:41,280
Now, burn down Straw Hat's ship!

1952
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,400
Roger!

1953
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,820
Are you ready, Joscar?

1954
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,060
I am, Mascar.

1955
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,750
Now, shoot them!

1956
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,410
Stop!!

1957
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,480
Stop!

1958
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,810
No, you stop.

1959
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,860
Leave my precious younger brother and sisters alone!

1960
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,620
A mirror!

1961
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,040
Hey, Nami!

1962
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,490
Jinbe, can you hear me?!

1963
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,920
Somebody, respond!

1964
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,580
At Sea - Totto Land

1965
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,640
Hey! Can you hear me?! Somebody!

1966
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,850
What? Luffy?!

1967
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,080
Nami!

1968
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,600
Luffy, it's me! Are you okay?!

1969
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,640
There are still some mirrors on the ship, right?!

1970
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,300
What?!

1971
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,850
Maybe in the mens' bedroom or the bathroom?!

1972
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,070
It's burning up!

1973
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,910
We're gonna shoot, Joscar.

1974
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,030
Yes, we are, Mascar.

1975
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,120
It's burning! It's burning!

1976
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,790
Luffy?! What'd you say about mirrors?!

1977
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,130
Break them all! To pieces!

1978
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,880
Are you out of your mind?!
How will you come back if we do that?!

1979
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I don't know... but I'll be fine!

1980
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,800
I'll figure something out!

1981
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,120
Sniff, sniff...

1982
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,490
I smell something!

1983
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,880
I don't have a nose, though!

1984
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,690
What?

1985
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,070
The bathroom is on fire!

1986
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,090
What's wrong?!

1987
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,180
How is this happening?!

1988
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,700
What?!

1989
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,600
Flaming arrows from inside the mirror!
Cannon shots from behind!

1990
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,350
One thing after the other!
My eyes are spinning!

1991
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,420
Oh, I don't have eyes that can spin!

1992
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,980
In any case, let's put it out, Brook!

1993
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,100
Now, you guys, keep shooting!

1994
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,350
We're gonna keep shooting, Joscar.

1995
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,270
Yes, we are, Mascar.

1996
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,610
Stop it, you bastards!

1997
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,900
Luffy!

1998
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,320
Luffy! Are you okay?!

1999
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,430
Those of you who'll march into the ship...
follow me!

2000
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,480
Oh, no!

2001
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,800
Nami! Hurry up and break the mirrors!
All of them!

2002
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,930
But...

2003
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,760
Our enemies are sending an army your way!
I can't stop them by myself!

2004
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,520
Let me focus just on this guy!

2005
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,840
Huh?

2006
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,030
Nami! We have a problem!

2007
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,160
We can't get away!

2008
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,130
A high wave!

2009
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,000
What?!

2010
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,460
Are you there...?

2011
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,450
I'm sorry, Luffy...

2012
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,100
I won't let you get away!

2013
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,070
Nami! What's wrong?!

2014
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,640
We...

2015
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,530
might be done for...

2016
