780
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

781
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,380
{\an8}yes

782
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,770
{\an8}we

783
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,040
{\an8}can!

784
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

785
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

786
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}m

787
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}i

788
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

789
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ma

790
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}im

791
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

792
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}a

793
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}yes

794
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}oh

795
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}we

796
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}ye

797
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
{\an8}can!

798
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,240
{\an8}swe

799
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}

800
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,370
{\an8}yes

801
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,610
{\an8}we

802
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,790
{\an8}can!

803
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes, we can!

804
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}

805
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}yes

806
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}ye

807
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}we

808
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}w

809
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,340
{\an8}can!

810
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,580
{\an8}ca

811
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:51,750
Ship, ship, ship! Ship!

812
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,710
0 and 4

813
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,420
By the way, have you ever read the WEJ?

814
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,680
The WEJ-rero, you know? The
World Economic Journal!

815
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,940
You know it, don't you-rero?

816
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,240
There was this comic strip in the WEJ!

817
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,700
A giant dreamlike robot was featured in it!
Sora, Warrior of the Sea!

818
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,790
I've been constantly reading it-rero!

819
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,690
Sora, a hero who can walk on water,

820
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,170
accompanied by a transforming
robot and a seagull-rorero,

821
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,390
fights the evil armies of Germa 66.
It's a story of a marine hero!

822
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,720
It has fans all over the world!

823
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,770
I heard it's based on true
stories of naval heroes.

824
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,740
{\an8}Navy

825
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,480
So it's sort of educational
material to brainwash children!

826
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,690
To teach them "The Navy is
always right and strong"!

827
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,450
But that's not what I like about it!

828
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,080
It's Germa! Germa 66!

829
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,290
They're evil armies that always corner Sora
by all possible means!

830
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,170
They're evil heroes!

831
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,140
Yes, they get defeated for the
sake of the story every time

832
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,890
but I'd always supported them
with a white-knuckled intensity!

833
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,430
I supported you guys!

834
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,810
Don't include me!
I have nothing to do with them!

835
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,440
Don't say such a thing!
I'm kind of happy to see you in person, actually!

836
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,790
Why don't you tell that to them?

837
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,450
Hey, open!

838
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,370
Door!

839
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,170
Listen...

840
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,550
Stop following me!
I thought this was my room!

841
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,470
This room belongs to me too!
Let me out! Dammit!

842
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,400
Why are you treating me so poorly?!
I'm a genius scientist!

843
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,210
Haven't you given up yet?!

844
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,650
We were only told to capture you, Caesar!

845
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,180
But he is a precious groom who will

846
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,290
connect the Vinsmoke Family
and us – the Charlotte Family!

847
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,480
You two are different in value.

848
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm not gonna get married.
Just get out.

849
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,630
"Get out"?!

850
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,720
He's just been mean to Vito!{\an8}

851
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,130
"Hitman Gotti"
The Fire Tank Pirates

852
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,640
I can't stand it! Apologize to him!

853
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,140
Gotti! Whoa, wait! Wait!

854
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,210
He hasn't been that mean to me!

855
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm okay. Thanks. We were
just messing around-rorero.

856
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,520
I wasn't.

857
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,150
Gotti. I want both you and Vito out!

858
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,210
Oh, you said it again!
You're a dead man!

859
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,200
No, Gotti!

860
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
Say whatever you like!

861
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,460
But I can't tolerate anyone
who insults my friends!

862
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,170
I said "Wait"! Please don't do it-rero!

863
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,130
You don't have to tolerate me.

864
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,960
It's not like I wanna be your friend.

865
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,180
Son of a...

866
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,520
Gotti!

867
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,390
What are you doing?!

868
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,650
Ma'am!

869
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,290
Do you know that he's Vinsmoke's son?!

870
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,500
If you lay so much as a finger on him,

871
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,090
your Father's head will roll!
Can't you get it?! Huh?!

872
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,640
Do you want me to chop your head off first,
you dummy?!

873
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,980
Ouch! I'm sorry! Ma'am! I'm sorry!

874
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,900
Hey, you...

875
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,940
Ow, ow, ow!

876
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,650
I'm sorry! Ma'am! I'm sorry!

877
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,200
No food for you today as punishment!

878
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,820
No, please, ma'am!

879
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,420
Sorry to bother you.
Let me hear about Germa some other time...

880
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,880
Nope.

881
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,470
Well...

882
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,310
She resembles her...

883
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,200
A few days later

884
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,200
I can't take it anymore...
I'm gonna die...{\an8}

885
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,040
On the Thousand Sunny

886
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,290
It's hot... I'm gonna die...

887
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,710
(I'm gonna be dried up...){\an8}

888
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,960
(Sanji, food! Ice cream!){\an8}

889
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,600
I can't stand the heat...
I wish I could take off this fur skin...

890
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,310
We're like you...
We Minks have low tolerance for heat.

891
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,830
It's really hot.
I'm gonna become a mummy...

892
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,800
A mummy...

893
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,130
A mummy?

894
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,860
A mummy!
Nami-san, if I become a mummy...

895
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,490
– ... it'd be a little bit of a resurrection for me, isn't it?
– I don't care.

896
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,810
In that case, may I see your panties?

897
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,600
I have no energy even to smack you.

898
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Nami, I'm so hungry and it's hot...

899
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
I need nutrition...

900
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,810
We're out of food and we couldn't fish
because it'd been stormy for days

901
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,430
and finally it's clear.

902
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,980
Catch some fish somehow
before the weather changes!

903
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,180
We're all gonna starve to death
before we get there!

904
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,840
Food...

905
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,230
We wanna do so, but Nami...

906
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,480
The water is boiling because it's too hot!

907
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
What?!

908
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,120
There won't be any fish around then.

909
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,540
What should we do?!

910
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,400
Emergency food...

911
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,380
Don't look at me!

912
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,460
Luffy! You got a bite!

913
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,560
There's a fish! It's huge!

914
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,490
– Pull it up, Luffy!
– Luffy-san, go...

915
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
You can do it, Luffy!

916
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
Food...

917
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,690
Food!

918
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,520
He did it!

919
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,190
Luffy!

920
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,990
It's very big!

921
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,510
Let's eat!

922
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,710
I did it!

923
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,120
Its color doesn't seem right.

924
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,170
Is it okay to eat?

925
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,480
What are you saying?!
There's no such thing as an inedible fish!

926
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,520
Luffy! Wait a sec!
I'll go check real quick!

927
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,140
What?

928
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,900
Where's the encyclopedia of fish?!

929
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,520
Sanji's bookshelf is full of nudity!

930
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,650
Found it!

931
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,920
Alright.

932
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
No, this is not it.

933
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,990
Here it is!

934
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,120
Luffy! Watch out for its skin!
The skin of that fish is extremely poisonous!

935
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Look! I found Sanji's note!

936
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,660
The skin tastes good!

937
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,920
Luffy! Wait! I'll grill it for you!

938
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,300
Here, try it, Carrot.

939
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,920
The skin's so slimy...

940
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,300
Luffy!

941
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,560
– Shall we eat too?
– Yes!

942
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,230
It's delicious! It's so delicious, Nami!

943
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,820
– Yes, it even makes me cry!
– I'm so happy to be alive! Grr!

944
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,360
It's so good!

945
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,770
I just cooked it like it
said in Sanji-kun's note.

946
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,540
Chopper, you need energy too, first.
Eat it.

947
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,760
Luffy's gonna... d-die!

948
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,590
I-It's cold...

949
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,940
Crying isn't gonna help!

950
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,720
Here! To take care of Luffy,
you have to gain energy, Chopper!

951
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Now, eat!

952
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,690
Okay!

953
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,770
But even if I wanna treat him,
we're short of antidotal herbs!

954
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,830
Yum!

955
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,730
We gotta find an island, Nami!

956
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,240
We're lacking herbs!

957
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
Yum!

958
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
Food...

959
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,460
But it's not that easy to find an island...

960
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,060
Sanji-kun's encyclopedia says
it's extremely poisonous

961
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,730
and kills you instantly if
you eat the skin, right?

962
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,980
Yeah.

963
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
Yum!

964
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,440
But he's still alive!
Doesn't that mean he has strong antibodies?

965
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,430
He has one of the best vital powers
of all humankind!

966
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,730
But he's in very bad shape!

967
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,620
Yum!

968
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,380
Luffy, are you okay?

969
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,220
The river is... beautiful...

970
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,550
He's seeing the River Styx!

971
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,930
We're about to reach Mama's territory.

972
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,280
There are some islands in the area
around the Whole Cake Island.

973
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,740
I'd say Black Leg and the others
have passed through those islands

974
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,880
and reached the Whole Cake Island by now.

975
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,580
Don't lower your guard, guys...

976
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,920
I'll stand guard!

977
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,490
I was gonna stop by at the first island.
Let's get an antidote there.

978
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,510
Okay.

979
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,980
What? This time, it's snow?

980
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,400
It's beautiful!

981
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,990
It's not snow! Are those Sugar Clouds?!

982
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,240
That's right.
And it's Cotton Candy Flurry that's falling.

983
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,830
What?! Cotton candy?!

984
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,850
Nice! Nice!

985
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,250
Sweet...

986
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,250
Territorial Sea Slug

987
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,310
Ring, ring, ring...

988
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,720
– Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...
– Oh? Who is it?

989
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,770
Your Transponder Snail is receiving
Warning Signals.

990
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,610
That means we're in Big
Mom's territory for sure.

991
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,070
Cotton candy!

992
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,950
Guys! Hide or disguise yourself!

993
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,480
So sweet!

994
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,450
Are you listening?!

995
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,250
I see something, Pekoms!

996
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,010
It's a ship! A ship is coming towards us!

997
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,050
What?! Are they here already?!

998
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,940
What do you mean?!

999
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,140
– That's probably a TARTE, one of our scout ships.
– What?!

1000
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,730
– I can't see it clearly because of the fog.
– What should we do?

1001
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,860
– I'll handle it somehow, so all of you, go hide!
– Got it!

1002
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,820
– Oh, no! Luffy is looking really sick!
– What?!

1003
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,800
The poison must've spread
into his system even more!

1004
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,450
It's dangerous! We gotta treat him A.S.A.P.!

1005
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,160
Don't they have an antidote
on that scout ship?!

1006
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,170
– I'll ask them for you! Hurry up and hide!
– Okay!

1007
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,040
Chopper-san, hurry up!

1008
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,140
What?!

1009
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,840
Luffy...

1010
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,740
Is that a Transponder Snail?

1011
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,700
It's huge!

1012
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,200
There is a number.

1013
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,280
Sixty-six?

1014
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,540
This is Germa.
Is that the Straw Hats' ship?

1015
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,960
That's Germa 66's ship!

1016
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,720
Germa 66...
The organization led by Sanji-kun's father...

1017
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,180
Why are you here, Straw Hats?!

1018
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,350
We're gonna collide!
Guys, furl the sail!

1019
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,280
Luffy, I'll be back.

1020
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,850
We managed to avoid the crash...

1021
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,480
Sanji!

1022
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,730
Sanji!

1023
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,990
Oh, that twirly eyebrow! It's Sanji-san!

1024
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,200
What? Sanji? Is that Sanji?!

1025
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,330
Sanji!

1026
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,620
Sanji-kun!

1027
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,500
Great!
I didn't expect to see you this soon!

1028
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,040
How lucky we are...

1029
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,680
Hey, Sanji! We have a problem!
Luffy got poisoned by eating fish and is dying!

1030
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,010
Is there any antidote on that ship?!

1031
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,350
Sanji!

1032
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,890
Stop calling me "Sanji"!

1033
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,190
You got the wrong person!

1034
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,180
Well, of course I look like him.

1035
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,700
My name is Yonji!{\an8}

1036
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,490
Vinsmoke Yonji
Germa 66 (Winch Green)

1037
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,330
Yonji?!

1038
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,160
Not "San(three)-ji" but "Yon(four)-ji"?!

1039
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,340
He resembles him
and has twirly eyebrows but he's not him?!

1040
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,620
My relationship with your friend Sanji
is a secret of secrets.

1041
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,090
It's absolutely confidential!

1042
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,760
He's definitely his younger brother...

1043
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,360
So he also had a younger brother...

1044
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,230
What?! How can you tell
that's his younger brother?!

1045
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,110
Cutie!! Cute, so cute...

1046
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,780
Are you really not Sanji?!

1047
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,450
Yonji-sama.

1048
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,140
I don't think they are transporting
Sanji-sama on that ship.

1049
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,120
So I guess we missed each other.

1050
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,250
You're right. Let's go back.
It was a wasted trip.

1051
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,880
Wait, Sanji!

1052
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,170
I'm Yonji!

1053
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,800
Oh, Luffy...

1054
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,720
A rash is breaking out all over his body!

1055
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,180
He's losing his resistance!

1056
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,650
This poison is so severe!
Luffy may have strong antibodies, but it's...

1057
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,780
Luffy, stay with us!

1058
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,450
Hey, it's just fish poison!
I thought you were gonna be the King of the Pirates!

1059
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,490
Luffy! Don't die!

1060
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,790
Luffy-san!

1061
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,790
Hey, please!
I bet you have antidotes!

1062
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,080
We used all we got,
but he still needs more!

1063
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,050
Hey!

1064
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,550
If you're Sanji-san's brother,
please save Luffy-san!

1065
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,110
I'm sorry.
I have no interest in saving people.

1066
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,880
Or do you wanna try and
rob the medicine from us?

1067
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,140
Like pirates?

1068
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,260
What a jerk!

1069
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,720
He's totally different from Sanji-kun!
Even though he likes girls too!

1070
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,240
He's not kind at all!

1071
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,580
Just say the word if you want me to kill him!

1072
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,170
Yonji.

1073
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,630
Stop being so stingy!

1074
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,760
Yonji-sama!

1075
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,120
What's going on?!

1076
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,770
Luffy!

1077
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,320
Oh, Reiju-sama!

1078
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,410
Luffy!

1079
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,620
Luffy!

1080
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,660
– Luffy-san!
– No!

1081
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,390
An invader!

1082
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,800
Who are you?!

1083
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,130
Hello. I'm sorry.

1084
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:36,150
My young brother is a cold-blooded jackass.

1085
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,960
Young brother?

1086
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,590
Are you his sister?

1087
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,580
Vinsmoke Reiju
Germa 66 (Poison Pink)

1088
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,350
Her eyebrows are twirly too!

1089
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,230
She's gorgeous!

1090
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,900
Reiju!

1091
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Is he flying?!

1092
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,530
You moron!
How could you humiliate me?!

1093
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,910
Shut up!
You should be ashamed of yourself!

1094
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,250
What? Is he hovering in the air?

1095
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,880
It's science!

1096
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,750
What?!

1097
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,300
Germa 66 is a group of fighters
who have honed themselves with science.

1098
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,260
They are a scientific
fighting squad, if you will.

1099
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,390
And Mama is...

1100
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,690
... looking to get that technology!

1101
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,280
Pekoms-san, if I'm correct,
Vinsmoke was...

1102
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,490
... the name of a royal family, wasn't it?

1103
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,310
If I remember right, it was a family that

1104
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,120
conquered the North Blue
by force of arms long ago!

1105
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,090
By "royal family,"
you mean like Vivi and Neptune?!

1106
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,800
What? Are they such a prominent family?

1107
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,310
That's right. They were synonymous
with "evil" in a past age.

1108
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,930
That's why they were used as
models for the comic strip.

1109
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,270
Skeleton-san,
you have so much historical knowledge.

1110
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,310
I've lived a long time...

1111
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,020
I'm dead now though.

1112
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:32,110
But it's not just a story from the past.
We're still a royal family.

1113
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,300
Germa is a country without soil.

1114
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,410
We have no land to govern,
but we're given the right to attend the Reverie.

1115
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,750
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1116
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,340
If that is so, may I see your panties?

1117
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,880
Stop it!

1118
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,770
Okay, now, can I have it?

1119
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Looks like he ate an Armored-Stone Fish
from the Boiling Sea, didn't he?

1120
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,860
What? How did you know?

1121
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,650
The way this poison works is unique.

1122
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,240
He must be greedy.
It could even kill a Giant instantly.

1123
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,790
What?! Oh, no!
Then, there's no way to save Luffy...

1124
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,140
I shouldn't be a ship doctor anymore!

1125
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,470
But this boy is lucky.

1126
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,120
Because this poison is...

1127
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,680
... one of my favorite things!

1128
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Wh-What are you gonna do?

1129
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,350
Let's have it!

1130
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:03,200
What?! Whoa-whoa-whoa!
If you suck up poison like that, you're gonna die!

1131
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,620
Oh! I'm jealous! Smooch!

1132
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,840
I wish I could change places with him!
Even though my lips...

1133
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,880
... are gone!

1134
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,270
The rash is transferring to her body!

1135
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,320
What?!

1136
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,190
The rash on Luffy's body is all gone!

1137
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,360
You've sucked it all out?! Are you alright?!

1138
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,210
Yes, of course. I'm Poison Pink.

1139
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,860
Poison...

1140
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,910
Pink?

1141
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,250
It was delicious!

1142
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,840
What?! What happened?!

1143
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,900
Luffy!

1144
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,880
Luffy!

1145
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
– I'm so relieved!
– Are you all right?!

1146
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,980
What a relief!

1147
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,360
Luffy!

1148
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,440
Oh? Did I fall asleep while eating fish?

1149
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,360
The skin was so good! Is there any left?

1150
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,080
– No! Don't you remember?!
– Nope.

1151
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,660
Sanji!

1152
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,210
She's a woman!

1153
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,290
Oh, right. Who is this?

1154
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,390
Luffy-san, she saved your life!

1155
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,090
What? Thank you for... what again?

1156
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,550
So that's Straw Hat Luffy...

1157
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,730
Oh! You're Sanji's sister!

1158
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,800
Yes.

1159
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,270
Sanji is one of us, the Vinsmoke Family.

1160
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,100
Our father parted from Sanji
when he was a little kid

1161
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,250
and has been looking for him.

1162
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,470
When Sanji's wanted poster was circulated
two years ago,

1163
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,290
our father immediately asked the Navy HQ
to pursue him.

1164
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,000
But they found the wrong man –
someone named Duval.

1165
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Duval!

1166
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,140
He's the guy from the Flying Fish Riders
who we met before Sabaody...

1167
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,180
Oh, I remember!
Sanji-san was mad about it too.

1168
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,920
It was only recently
that the Government called us saying...

1169
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,700
... that they finally captured an image
of Black Leg Sanji amid the chaos

1170
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,240
evoked by the Straw Hats' comeback.

1171
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,580
Our father raised the bounty right away

1172
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,070
and made them change "DEAD OR ALIVE"...

1173
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,080
... to "ONLY ALIVE."

1174
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,960
That's why only Sanji-kun's poster was
changed a little bit.

1175
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,260
Where is Sanji now?

1176
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,010
I don't know.

1177
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,270
Maybe he's with Big Mom or with our father.

1178
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,020
We came to greet him,
but I think we missed each other.

1179
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,800
Well, if he can attend the tea party,
that's all that matters.

1180
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,790
And I got to see you guys too.

1181
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,670
Thank you for looking after my brother
all this time.

1182
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,340
Sanji's sister!

1183
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,510
Thank you for saving my life.

1184
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,270
But...

1185
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,560
I still want Sanji back! He's my friend!

1186
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,050
I'm gonna take back Sanji at any cost!

1187
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,890
See? She saved our enemy's life.

1188
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,940
Hey, you!
You're Pekoms from the Big Mom Pirates, right?

1189
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,030
Why are you with the Straw Hats?

1190
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:38,200
I have my own reason!
Why do I have to explain it to you guys?! Grr!

1191
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,000
There's no bond between us yet!

1192
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,590
You're right!

1193
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,580
I'll pretend that I didn't
see anything for now.

1194
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,690
Yeah, we don't wanna cause trouble and
break off our brother's marriage.

1195
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,360
We'd best all tread lightly.

1196
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,610
That'd be smart! Grr!

1197
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,200
Unanchor the ship. Let's go back.

1198
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,330
Well, good luck.

1199
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,030
They didn't get into a fight with Germa,
it seems.

1200
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,040
Yes, I'm sure that's their ship.
Straw Hat Luffy is on board too.

1201
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,250
What do you wanna do?

1202
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,340
Jinbe.

1203
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,500
