Luffy vs. Sanji

46
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,110
Fly away...

47
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,620
... to the end of the New World!

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,330
Cannon Ball!

49
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,050
Mama, Smoothie-sama of the
Three Sweet Commanders has arrived!

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,840
Whole Cake
Chateau

51
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,050
Okay.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,660
Sweet Commander Katakuri-sama 
will be here soon, too!

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,900
Oh, it's been a while since
they all got together!

54
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,820
What about Cracker?
Is he home yet?

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,710
I bet he'll be back soon
with Straw Hat's head as a present!

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,080
I can't wait!

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,170
Hm? Is that...?

58
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,770
What happened?

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,870
What is it?!

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,700
Big Brother!

61
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,540
Big Brother!

62
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,250
Big Brother Cracker!

63
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,000
This can't be happening!
He's one of our Three Sweet Commanders!

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,170
Who did this?! I'll kill the bastard!{\an8}

65
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,200
Charlotte Mont d'Or
19th Son of Charlotte, Minister of Cheese

66
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,600
Charlotte Opera
5th Son of Charlotte, Minister of Cream

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Where did he fly from-fa?!{\an8}

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,380
I think he went to the woods...{\an8}

69
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,160
Charlotte Galette
18th Daughter of Charlotte, Minister of Butter

70
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,140
... to take care of Straw
Hat Luffy last night.{\an8}

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,140
That means...

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,070
Straw Hat Luffy must be somewhere near-fa!

73
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,030
Put out an emergency alert!

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,510
Evacuate!

75
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,680
What happened?!

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,830
Sweet Commander Cracker-sama was defeated!

77
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,830
What?!

78
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,510
The Seducing
Woods

79
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,390
Luffy! Are you okay?!

80
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,600
I ate a lifetime's worth of biscuits...

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,500
But you shrunk back down a lot.

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,380
Gear Fourth takes so much energy.

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,580
Pound!

84
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,100
Where were you?!

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,580
Well, I'm sorry for running away.
I thought you were going to lose.

86
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,500
You're being pretty honest!

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Because that guy was one
of the Three Sweet Commanders...

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,130
Well...

89
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,400
Anyway, we won!

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
We did it! We did it!

91
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,440
Yay! Yay!

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Lighten up!
We beat one of the Emperor's top officers!

93
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,530
I... can't even move...

94
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,910
What have we done...

95
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,290
We helped them defeat Cracker-sama-ju.

96
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,590
Everyone knows that we Homies
cannot resist the power of Mama's Vivre Card!

97
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:10,180
That is why even Mama's
children aren't allowed to carry one!

98
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,020
Why do you have it?!

99
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,330
Is that true?

100
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,980
So it's really quite a valuable thing.

101
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,430
But you're in big trouble.

102
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,230
Why?

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,530
When Sweet Commander Snack was defeated...

104
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,490
The vengeful Cracker's
fleet blackened the sea

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,780
and the angry Linlin created a storm...

106
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,510
I heard it sank the enemy
ship in the blink of an eye!

107
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,010
Storm?

108
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,370
Linlin is always accompanied
by weather elements.

109
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,340
Weather?

110
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,460
On her left hand, Zeus, a thundercloud!

111
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,810
On her right hand, Prometheus, a sun!

112
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,430
Nothing can stop her when she gets mad.

113
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,910
Before she hears about this,
you'd better run!

114
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,450
I don't care if she gets mad!

115
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,700
What?!

116
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm the one who wants to get mad!
First of all, Sanji, that fool!

117
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,380
To my buds, I've gotta
see a woman. I'll be back.{\an8}

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,970
How could he disappear leaving
a note behind suddenly!

119
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,970
Without telling us why!

120
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,970
This is my problem.

121
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,230
I'll be back.

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,060
Tell them "Hi" for me.

123
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,380
Thanks to Pudding's map,
we made it this far,

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,740
but Pekoms went missing.

125
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,040
And although Pudding said
that she'd bring Sanji,

126
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,030
no one was there
at the rendezvous point.

127
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,700
We wasted a lot of time while we were lost in the forest!

128
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,920
When they get married,
Sanji will Big Mom's subordinate, right?!

129
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,850
We gotta get moving!

130
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,890
Yeah! When is the wedding?

131
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,020
Cracker said the Vinsmokes will enter...

132
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,540
a castle today, where the
wedding will take place.

133
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,900
What time is it now? We've gotta stop them!

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,230
A-Are you serious?
If you don't run away, you'll really...

135
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,190
I'm not gonna run away!

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,790
Hey, tree!

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,990
You know where the castle is, don't you?!

138
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,960
Well...

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,000
Carry me to the castle!

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
No way-ju...

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,410
We're gonna take Sanji back at any cost!

142
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,920
Nami, can you hear me?!

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,830
Chopper!

144
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,120
How are you guys?

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
We're okay!
If things go well, we'll see you guys and Brook...

146
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,170
What?

147
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,580
That doesn't look okay! Chopper?

148
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,070
Either way, we can't be saved from the outside!

149
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,130
Just keep...

150
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Chopper?!

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,300
Nami, don't worry! We're fine...

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,930
How can I not worry?

153
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,470
Right, we're gonna go to the castle
to find Sanji-kun!

154
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,610
Okay!

155
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,280
Once you rescue Sanji,
let us know through this mirror aga...

156
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,280
It broke!

157
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,990
Hey, Chopper?! Carrot?!

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,580
It turned into a normal mirror.
Are they okay?

159
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,830
Has he gotten smaller than before?!

160
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,550
Whoa... What?

161
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,200
What's going on?!

162
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,770
Whoa...

163
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,510
He's almost back to normal!
Is that humanly possible?!

164
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,270
– Meat...
– Meat?!

165
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,300
Hey, young girl.

166
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,860
You're lucky.

167
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,990
Why?

168
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,120
There they are.

169
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,450
That's Germa 66.

170
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,460
Can you see Sanji?

171
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,750
Is that it?!

172
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,050
Hey, Sanji!

173
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,420
Your Majesty, something
is charging towards us.

174
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,930
It's been a while!

175
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,440
What?! That idiot made it this far
into Big Mom's territory?!

176
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,460
What is the big tree behind him?!
It's running!

177
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,400
Hey!

178
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,720
Sanji-kun!

179
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,350
I'm glad that we made it in time!

180
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,740
I thought I'd never see you again!

181
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,260
Why are they... here?

182
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,190
Is that Straw Hat Luffy?

183
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Hey! We're here to pick you up!

184
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,910
Sanji!

185
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,420
Stop it, you fool!
The Calicoach will turn over!

186
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,170
Let's go, Sanji!

187
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,860
You said you'd be back in the note
but I didn't wanna wait.

188
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,470
Banquet!

189
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,300
I was gonna come by myself, but...

190
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,110
You said your hands are important to you.

191
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,550
If you try to get off of this island,
your hands will be blown off!

192
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,410
If someone declines Mama's invitation...

193
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,870
... So, Zoro and the others must've gotten
to the Wano Country...

194
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,830
We'll chop this guy's head off.

195
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,530
... That's why Nami, Chopper, Brook and I came
to pick you up. And...

196
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,060
You are a sacrifice, Sanji.
I haven't changed...

197
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,640
But if you betray the honor of manhood,
I'll chop off my own head as well!

198
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,970
Sanji, I'm hungry!

199
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,920
I don't think of you as my son even one bit!

200
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,510
That's how a parent pays the price.

201
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,940
– It's a shame that I don't want anyone to know!
– Sanji!

202
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,970
Hey, Sanji!

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,690
Don't catch a cold.

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,620
... And I had no choice, so...

205
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,550
Hey! What are you doing, Sanji-kun?!

206
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,680
Get packing, you low-class pirates!

207
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,770
My name is Vinsmoke Sanji.

208
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,490
I'm a prince...

209
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,110
of the Germa Kingdom!

210
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,260
I'm sorry for keeping it a secret.

211
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,280
I thought that it would drive you to grief.

212
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,290
The difference between our standings
couldn't be clearer.

213
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,500
If I stay here, I can spend money
and use soldiers and servants as I like.

214
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,400
Going back to that crappy ship
with you and your friends...

215
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,680
... or staying here,
marrying Big Mom's beautiful daughter.

216
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
It's pretty obvious which is a happier life.

217
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,840
Don't take the note seriously.

218
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,080
I won't go back with you!

219
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,900
I can't believe you've come all the way here.
Thanks for your trouble.

220
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
Get out of here... I forgot your name.

221
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,120
Screw that! What are you talking about?!
I'm not convinced!

222
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,650
Okay, I'll help you drive them off.

223
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,900
Sit back!

224
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll...

225
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,760
... send them away!

226
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,850
What do you mean by sending us away, Sanji?

227
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,940
Get packing.

228
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,660
There is no other meaning.

229
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,330
I don't know what made you come,

230
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,730
but I appreciate
that you took the trouble.

231
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,530
Having said that, if you really think about me,
you should've done the opposite.

232
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,060
Rather than being with you guys
who are poor and weak,

233
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,040
it'd be better to be part of
the rich and powerful Big Mom Pirates.

234
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,920
I'll be happier.

235
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,510
I'm not so sure about you

236
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,720
becoming the King of the Pirates,
to be honest.

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,250
It's only human nature
to jump on the bandwagon.

238
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,980
Stop joking, Sanji-kun!
What are you talking about?!

239
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,900
Then, all this time,

240
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,900
you've been fooling me.

241
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,420
I've actually been looking down on you.

243
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,420
What is that glow? A flame?!

244
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,500
This ought to be fun to watch.

245
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,300
I bet you didn't see it coming,
so it's hard to accept.

246
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,930
I'll prove it to you. Get ready.

247
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,060
Diable Jambe...

248
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,230
No, Sanji-kun!

249
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,760
Joue Shot!

250
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,760
{\an8}Cheek Shot

251
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,430
Luffy! You're bleeding!

252
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,150
Sanji-kun, did you really...

253
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,440
Get ready to fight.

254
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,220
Use your Haki or you're gonna die.

255
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,660
I just wanna talk to you.
Why do I need Haki?

256
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm not gonna...

257
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
... fight you!

258
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,140
Then...

259
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,810
... go away!

260
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm not gonna do that either!

261
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,690
You've always...

262
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,070
... been selfish!

263
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,010
Hey you, cook!

264
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,570
Join my group!

265
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,360
Be the cook on my pirate ship!

266
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,150
Please stop, Sanji-kun!

267
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,900
We just came to pick you up!

268
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,440
Luffy has...

269
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,650
... fought against their top officer all night
to get this far!

270
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,020
So his body is...

271
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,470
Cut it out, Nami!

272
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,170
Stay out of this!

273
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,870
This is...

274
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,490
... a duel!

275
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,050
You call this a duel?!

276
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,970
Sanji-kun!

277
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,730
Get out of my sight now!

278
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,910
Luffy!

279
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,220
Go away!

280
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,510
Go away!

281
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,260
Get out of my face...

282
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,340
... now!!

283
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,170
I refuse!

284
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,030
Luffy!

285
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,430
Sanji-kun!

286
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,610
Here we go!

287
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,290
Sanji-kun... Please stop...

288
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,620
That's enough! Stop, Sanji-kun!

289
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,680
We'll leave!!

290
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,440
I won't!

291
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,410
You're a good cook,

292
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,910
so let's be pirates together!

293
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,070
Concassé!

294
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,070
{\an8}Crush

295
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,400
Luffy! Luffy!

296
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,700
How strong...

297
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,400
After all, he's a Vinsmoke.

298
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,630
Luffy!

299
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,130
Luffy! Luffy! Hey! Stay with me!

300
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,160
Luffy! Luffy!

301
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,530
Hey, Sanji!

302
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,080
Goodbye!

303
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Sorry...

304
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,860
... we should never have done this!

305
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,900
Oh! A bitchy girl! How hot!

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,000
The superfluous ties have
finally been severed.

307
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,370
Thanks for waiting.

308
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,460
– Let's go.
– Yes, sir.

309
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,580
Luffy!

310
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,420
Wait!

311
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,870
Sanji!!

312
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,500
"Low-class pirate"?!

313
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,620
I know you were just saying
things that you didn't want to!

314
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,940
Stop lying!

315
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,290
Did you think
that you could send me away that easily?!

316
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,460
Screw that!

317
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,470
No matter how many times you kick me,

318
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,950
you're the one...

319
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,280
... that gets hurt!!

320
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,050
Luffy! Why?!
Whatever the reason is, he can't do this...

321
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,610
Shut up!

322
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,070
Should we stop, Sanji?

323
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,580
Keep going.

324
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,710
Say...

325
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,000
do you know about the All Blue?

326
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,990
It's a miracle sea!

327
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,680
In that sea...

328
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,210
Our journey...

329
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,210
... isn't over yet!

330
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,650
I'll be here waiting!

331
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,670
If you don't come back, I'll be here...

332
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,820
... starving to death!

333
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,120
You're the cook of my ship!

334
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,690
He was making food for rats again!

335
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,830
I won't eat anything
other than what you cook!

336
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,870
Even if I get hungry or
spears rain down on me,

337
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,190
I'll stay right here and wait for you!

338
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,520
Be sure to come back, Sanji!

339
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,370
Without you, I...

340
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,770
I can't become the King of the Pirates!!
