I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,320
I have reached my limit! I have a muscle cramp!

Though I do not have any muscles to have a cramp in!

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,680
Brook, you're pretty enthusiastic, huh?

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,120
You took out quite a few of the Flying Fish.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,880
I am glad to have been of help!

26
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,320
But please... let me rest for a while...

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,420
Zoro-san...

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
It looks like you're still hurt...

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,860
I won't let these fish beat me! Don't worry about it!

30
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,340
You let down your guard, Roronoa!

Octopus-Arm Danger!

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,100
You saved me, huh?

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,850
That's right! You guys were spacing out and all...

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,700
Hacchin! You were really cool!

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,560
Just what I'd expect from you, Hachi!

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,260
Really?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Die, fishman!

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,940
Right! Excuse me!

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
I thought I was gonna die! Thanks!

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,710
I told you to watch yourself, didn't I?

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,380
Don't take them on one by one... Get in formation!

43
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,380
Formation (Hentai)

44
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,880

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,260
You called?

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,880

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,880
You mean me?

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,640
They're here!

55
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,330
Here I am! Here!

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,350
Welcome!

57
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,980
A woman? It's a shame, but we were ordered to kill everyone!

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,140
Can you kill me?

59
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,440
What the-?!

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,300
Too bad.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,420
Mirage Tempo!

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,180
Beware of thunderclouds of despair!

Diamond!

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,060
Don't break formation!

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,520
I knew it, they're calling for me.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Now!

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,400
Huh? They didn't mean me?

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,570
What?! Bullets don't affect him?!

72
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,400
Strong Hammer!

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,060
Amazing! They're all really strong, Pappag!

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,520
To think they'd go this far...

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,820
We were just gonna grab Hachi and escape...

76
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,100
Take this!

77
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,590
Damn! Franky! We need to get the ship ashore!

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,180
They're at an advantage out here in the ocean!

79
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,610
That's probably why they live out here, you know.

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,820
They're not gonna give us a chance to steer the ship!

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,540
Luffy!

82
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,460
Run! A huge guy is coming!

83
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,560
Is it the Iron Mask?!

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,340
The masked guy and a cow!

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,410
A cow?

86
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,930
That's Motobaro's voice!

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,260
It's the Head!

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,840
Getting yourselves knocked down in droves...

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
What's that?! Something showed up!

90
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,400
Duval's
Beloved Bison
Motobaro

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,400
You're not just bugs, y'know! Flying Fish Riders!

92
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,060
H-He crushed his own house...

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,400
I don't need this base any more, as long as I can kill the Straw Hats!

94
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,020
We're so sorry, Head! We'll draw them out to sea and finish them off right...

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,400
Move it!

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have no need for a fishman, mermaid, or glove! If you wanna run, then just get lost!

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm a starfish!

98
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,600
I didn't enter the slave-trading market 'cause I wanted to!

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,470
You guys understand that, right?!

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,360
Of course, Head!

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,230
What a great day this is!

102
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,780
The man whom I wanted to kill so badly that I even saw him in my dreams, is right here.

103
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,890
I'm so grateful!

104
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,500
I guess there is a god, huh?

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,220
One day, I was suddenly thrown into the depths of hell because of that man!

106
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,840
Hey, isn't he looking at us while he's talking?

107
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,510
Today, I'll kill ya right here, even if I die myself...

108
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,710
Pirate... Black Leg Sanji!

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,420
I really wanted to meet'cha!

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh, crap! The Head's really pissed off!

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,320
Me? That guy wants to kill me?

112
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,690
Sanji, who's that guy?

113
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,460
It seems like he's got some sort of grudge against you...

114
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,060
Could it be something that happened at the restaurant? Try to remember!

115
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,780
If it's something from back then, I did plenty of things that people might be mad at me for...

116
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,540
Let him shoot you! You've deserved it!

117
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,520
Quit playin' dumb, Black Leg!

118
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,320
We're talkin' about somethin' recent here!

119
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,660
Crap! Those are harpoons!

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,890
But if it's something recent, then I'm even more confused!

121
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,020
W-What? There's something strange about these harpoons...

122
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,200
These're my scorpion venom harpoons!

123
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,620
If they hit'cha, ya'll be headed for the afterlife in three minutes!

124
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,620
Know the depths of my fury!

125
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,740
Nami-san, watch out!

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,980
Damn bastard, I can't remember at all! Who are you?!

127
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,080
I'm gonna kill ya and yer crew!

128
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,420
I saw what was underneath that mask.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,990
Really? Who is he?

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,720
Don't be surprised. You've seen his face too!

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,680
Me too?

132
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,270
That bastard...!

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,940
He knocked off Duval-sama's iron mask!

134
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,860
Very well... Take a close look at my scarred face!

135
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,320
What the-?!?!?!

136
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,420
No way!

137
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,900
He's...!

138
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,100
My...

139
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,840
Oh, my...

140
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,540
I wanna cry!

141
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,110
I've been waitin' for this day...

142
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,930
I decided to murder ya, and so I set out to sea!

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,220
But lookin' for ya would be a problem, y'know...

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,360
After all, yer wanted poster and yer true face didn't match!

145
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,300
Even if the marines or bounty hunters ran into ya, they just might' not notice ya!

146
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,000
Nah, there's no way that'd happen!

147
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
Those guys'd definitely find ya!

148
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Head...!

149
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,720
They'd find ya, and then they'd say...

150
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,460
"Found you!"

151
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,150
"Black Leg Sanji!"

152
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,050
And then I'd tell 'em...

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,680
"I dunno anyone like that!"

154
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,620
"I ain't even a pirate!"

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,380
Hey, Sanji, where are you going?!

156
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Do ya realise...

157
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,980
How frightenin' it was, suddenly bein' targeted by bounty hunters?!

158
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,020
Why?

159
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,980
Why'd I suddenly have to be chased by the Navy HQ?!

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,820
Why'd all those big name bounty hunters suddenly start huntin' me?!

161
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,860
Why?!

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,980
Sanji?

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,080
What'd I do?!

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,520
Give me my life back!

165
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,500
Black Leg Sanji!

166
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,880
Like I care!

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,460
Head!

168
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
Whaddaya mean, "Like I care"?!

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,360
If ya ain't gonna take responsibility for dis, then who will?!

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,220
Shut up!

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,260
I'm more pissed about that wanted-poster than anyone!

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,740
So, things like this really can happen, huh?

173
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,260
What a surprise...

174
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,900
This world is really big.

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,340
Was Sanji born under some kind of miracle-star or something?

176
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,250
He might meet quite an interesting end someday...

177
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
I can't help but feel sorry for that Duval guy...

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,660
Those two look exactly like each other!

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Like two peas in a pod.

180
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,500
Brook! I'm so gonna kick the crap out of you afterwards!

181
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,640
Well then, Sanji...

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,080
We'll just be going on ahead.

183
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,690
Are you saying this is my fault?!

184
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,220
If you don't want to look like that wanted picture, you could just change your hairstyle or your beard!

185
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,420
There are plenty of things you could just change!

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
So I could have done that?

187
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,360
Are you all morons?!

188
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
We're not morons!

189
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,770
You know, Black Leg, we...

190
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,880
We...

191
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,240
Were running a small, unknown mafia in some distant corner of this sea...

192
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,600
We spent every single day by threatening the villagers for money...

193
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,040
That was the kind of happy life we had.

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,760
Black Leg...

195
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,700
Do you understand?

196
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,240
I, who had never caused any kind of uproar...

197
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,620
Suddenly found myself with a bounty of 77 million...

198
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
And was chased around by those powerful marines...

199
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,240
I got this nasty scar on my back,

200
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,700
and was forced to wear this iron mask to hide my face from the world!

201
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,400
It's yer fault dat my life was ruined!

202
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm prepared to chase ya to da ends of Hell!

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,160
If dat's a problem for ya...

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,260
Then how about you just kill me right now?!

205
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm bein' killed!

206
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,760
Those stupid accusations of yours...

207
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,380
Why'd you even have to put Nami-san and Robin-chan in danger?!

208
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,600
It's dat ship and dat crew dat made ya a famous pirate!

209
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,600
Of course I'd want revenge on'em!

210
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,680
Ya guys should all die!

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,060
Poison harpoons?!

212
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,580
Get in formation!

213
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:38,980
Huh?

214
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,720
Oh, crap!

215
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,180
Sanji-kun!

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,340
They're trying to pull him down into the ocean!

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Sanji! Hurry up and get out of there!

218
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,780
Damn, this net is made of steel!

219
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,440
Now suffer and drown!

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Sanji!

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,520
Dammit... I'll save you right now!

222
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,200
Don't go there yourself, idiot! I'll go get him!

223
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,200
Wait!

224
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,240
You humans are too slow, you can't catch him!

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,620
Leave this to me!

226
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,840
Fool!

227
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,180
You fishmen don't stand a chance at catching up!

228
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,740
The Flying Fish are the fastest animals in the sea!

229
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,400
And the Riders riding them have air canisters, so they can stay under water for as long as they like!

230
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,700
That guy doesn't stand a chance!

231
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,200
The next time that guy, Black Leg surfaces...

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,920
He'll already have drowned and died!

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,680
What was that!?

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
Feel the Head's anger, Black Leg!

235
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,040
Can't breathe...

236
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,700
It's okay!

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,540
Camie!

238
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,140
Hey, cowboy!

239
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,220
It seems that you forgot someone here!

240
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,900
Huh?

241
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,340
The Flying Fish are most certainly faster than fishmen.

242
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,680
They're in the top-class among sea-creatures. They really are something!

243
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
However...

244
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,840
The creatures at the very top of that top-class are the merfolk!

245
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,760
In this great sea...

246
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,820
There are no creatures that can outrun a mermaid under water!

247
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,020
It's alright...

248
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll save you right now, Sanji-chin!

249
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,400
Is she really that incredible?

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,540
Actually, if she hadn't been spacing out all the time, nobody would ever catch her!

251
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,720
I see...

252
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,460
Camie!

253
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
Take care of Sanji!

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
What's that?!

255
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
A huge anchor?

256
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,320
It's way too huge!

257
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,840
Aim for the Straw Hat crew's ship.

258
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,180
Hit it head-on and sink it!

259
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,100
Some of'em are Devil Fruit users!
If we get'em into the water, they're ours!

260
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
This is bad! Just one hit from that and we'll sink!

261
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,720
Dodge it! Use the Burst or the Paddle! Can we make it?

262
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,560
No, it's too late!

263
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,440
Hurry and come with me, Usopp!

264
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,940
Huh?

265
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,790
Y-Yeah!

266
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,100
You get on the bow!

267
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,680
Huh?

268
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,260
Uh, right!

269
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
We're gonna use our secret weapon!

270
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,640
Secret weapon?

271
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,640
Drop it!

272
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,700
The Sunny's in trouble!

273
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,820
That thing is dangerous!

274
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,040
Believe in this ship!

275
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,240
The mane started spinning!

276
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,480
Sink!

277
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,680
It's falling right at us!

278
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Emergency Evasion...

279
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,500
Secret Weapon!

280
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
Chicken Voyage!

281
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,460
They dodged it!

282
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,180
No way!

283
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,260
I've never heard of any ship that can go backwards!

284
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,040
Usopp!

285
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,120
Get inside the prow!

286
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,760
The prow?

287
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,080
Woah! You can enter it!

288
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
Don't think dodging it was all we could do!

289
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,360
This ship has got way more power than that!

290
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,100
Awesome!

291
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,360
What is it now?!

292
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,860
Charging complete!

293
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,760
Hey!

294
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,220
What should I do now?

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
Get as many as you can inside the circle!

296
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,640
Circle?

297
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,020
Like this?

298
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,880
They're in!

299
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Lock on with the button on the handle, then pull the lever!

300
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,340
This and...

301
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,220
This?

302
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,260
What's that?

303
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,960
{\an8}Gaon: Lion's roar

304
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,960
Gaon Cannon!

305
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,120
Fire!

306
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,220
Amazing!

307
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
You're too impressed!

308
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,140
Did you see that?!

309
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,740
The Sunny's full power?

310
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,540
That move took out almost all the Flying Fish!

311
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,360
That's just how good Usopp is!

312
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,440
For a first try it was magnificent!

313
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,720
Wow!!! What an amazing destructive power!

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,180
Sunny!

315
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,180
Lion-chan is incredible! It seemed as if my eyes were going to pop out!

316
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,300
Though I have no eyes to pop out...

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
It uses three barrels of cola to prevent the ship from being blown away...

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,640
And at the same time, it releases two barrels worth of Coup de Burst from the cannon.

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,840
It uses a ton of cola, so don't you overuse it!

320
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
She's tied us up with the net!

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,580
Damn!

322
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
That speedy mermaid!

323
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,260
We're almost there, Sanji-chin...

324
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,520
Hang in there!

325
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,700
Camie!

326
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,240
Thank goodness!

327
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,620
Is Sanji all right?

328
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,560
Everyone, it's terrible!

329
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,660
Sanji-chin is losing a lot of blood!

330
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,160
Huh?

331
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,480
Did he get done in?!

332
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,280
Just when I thought I'd saved him, a lot of blood suddenly started flowing out of his nose!

333
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,340
Nosebleed?

334
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,160
It's fine...

335
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,040
If he dies like that, then let him die.

336
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,260
That's true...

337
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,620
At least he seems happy.

338
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,480
Hang in there, Sanji-chin!

339
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,380
Is this...

340
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,880
Heaven?

341
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,100
Damn...

342
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,980
He survived, huh?!

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,680
Well, it looks like your subordinates are useless now, doesn't it?

344
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,480
Why, you...!

345
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,840
Then, I guess you should learn how terrifying Motobaro is!

346
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,140
I've lost count of how many fools have been impaled by his giant horns to this day!

347
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,440
They say his horns have even managed to destroy village dams...

348
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,760
Put him in a cage, and he'll break straight out!

349
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,500
The only reason I've been able to escape from the Navy all this time...

350
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,260
Is because of this guy's horns!

351
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,660
They call them the "Heart-smashing horns"!

352
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,480
All right.

353
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,560
I'll stop you!

354
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,460
Go, Motobaro!

355
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,020
Watch out, Luffy!

356
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,060
The horns were completely useless!

357
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,000
There's no point in us fighting!

358
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Hey, what's wrong, Motobaro?

359
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,140
The cow's acting strangely, isn't it?

360
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,280
What?

361
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,520
He lost consciousness?

362
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,220
What just happened?

363
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,600
Luffy!

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
What did you do?

365
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,180
I didn't do anything!

366
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,660
Motobaro!

367
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,800
Damn, how can this be?!

368
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,220
It doesn't seem like he attacked it...

369
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,020
It seems like Luffy won the cow over by talking to it...

370
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
What?

371
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,440
You mean, he psyched it out?

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
But that huge thing just fainted!

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,720
Is that even possible?

374
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,420
Why, you... Damn Straw Hat kid...!

375
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,240
Hey, wait a minute, Luffy!

376
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,400
Sanji!

377
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,040
I'm glad you're alright!

378
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,760
I'll end this stupid incident filled with pointless accusations myself!

379
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,260
Finish it?

380
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
Black Leg!

381
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,740
As long as you keep on living as a pirate I'll never find peace!

382
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,920
I'm the one who's sick of the accusations!

383
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,380
Shut up!

384
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,200
I don't want to see that stupid poster-face any more than you do.

385
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,420
It shouldn't even exist in real life!

386
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,240
Well, then...

387
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,380
You should just die!

388
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,000
Oeil

389
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,000
{\an8}Eye

390
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,680
Nez

391
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,680
{\an8}Nose

392
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,840
Joue

393
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,840
{\an8}Cheek

394
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,720
Bouche

395

396
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,490

{\an8}Jaw

400
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,440
Please, stop it...

401
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,320
Parage Shot!

402
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,320
{\an8}Trimming Shot

403
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,680
Taste the classiness of my finishing attack, and end your misery.

404
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,560
You shitty bastard.
