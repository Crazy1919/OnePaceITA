I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550
Chasing and being chased on top of Mobius' ring.

I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,140
I'd heard some rumors that you were on this island...

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:51,270
I Couldn't Save Them!!!

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,000
So, that was true?

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,880
Seeing how you helped out these brats,

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,860
that must mean you're still a pirate, at your age...

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
Rayleigh-san?

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,820
If you people would withdraw my bounty...

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,600
I'd be able to retire in peace, too.

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,440
The pirates' sins won't disappear, right?

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
Especially not those of the Roger Pirates.

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,080
But if we were to try and catch you,

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,240
it would require a bit more dedication than we have right now.

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,440
What a relief, Zoro! This old man really is amazing!

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,940
The body I could not pierce no matter how many times I stabbed him...

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,180
He just stopped him! How?!

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,240
You can't let them leave, can you, Kizaru-kun?

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,040
Give me a break, here!

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,800
If we can't catch these kids...

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,620
Then we at Navy HQ wouldn't be able to face the Celestial Dragons in Mariejoa.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,880
Would you please get out of my way?

40
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,650
Usopp! Brook!

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,210
Take Zoro and run!

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,280
Right!

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,020
Let's go, Brook!

44
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,380
Everyone, only think of how to escape!

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,940
Right now...

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,800
We can't...

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,060
Beat these guys!

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,300
Oh, great. That's really annoying.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
Franky!

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm gonna use all my cola energy...

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,620
This'll be my last attack!

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
Coup de Vent!

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
That damned idiot must have felt that!

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,980
Run!

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,940
Pops, thank you!

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,120
No problem! I'll pray for your safety!

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,320
Mirror of Yata

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,600
It's bright!

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,160
Light! He's doing something!

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
I won't let you pass!

61
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,840
It's been a long time since I used my sword.

62
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm in trouble here...

64
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,320
I was expecting things to be easy when I came to this island...

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,140
Worries are also a part of life, Kizaru-kun.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,100
The light ahead of us disappeared.

67
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,140
Seems like the old man saved us again.

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,340
T-T-That was scary!

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,620
Seems like he's the real Dark King.

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,140
This is the first time I've seen anyone stop the old guy.

71
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,780
But we're just one step away from catching Roronoa with his bounty of over 100 million...

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,920
PX-1! Roronoa is half-dead!

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
Go take him out!

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,820
He's...

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,840
Franky!

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
Take care of Nami-san! Please go on without me!

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,820
Be careful! We'll be alright!

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,160
Sanji-kun?!

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,520
He's going after Usopp and the others!

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Put me down...

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll let you escape...

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,400
Don't be ridiculous! You're even more useless than I am right now!

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
We're running together!

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,100
That's what Luffy wanted us to do!

85
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,140
Could it be...?!

86
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,180
He's here!

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,080
Usopp-san!

88
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,200
Usopp-san, go on ahead!

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,260
Stop it, Brook!

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,580
You know how strong he is, don't you?!

91
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,440
Hurry!

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,800
All for one, one for all!

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,760
There are times when a man has no choice but to act!

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,040
A bone-crushing defeat...

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Brook!

96
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,020
Don't come here!

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,780
Stop right there, you damn bastard!

98
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,440
Sanji!

99
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,900
My leg...!

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,660
Run, Sanji!

101
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,320
He's aiming for you!

102
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,780
Idiot! Hurry up and go!

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,340
As you can see, my subordinates are more than strong enough.

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,660
Zoro, I'm sorry! I dropped you!

105
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,680
Are you alright?

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,010
They're in trouble over there!

107
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,230
I won't even need my broadaxe, will I?

108
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,110
I thought I told you, you don't have time to worry about your friends!

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,770
Leg Locked, Heave-Ho!

110
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,010
Luffy!

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,570
How can that guy's attacks hurt a rubber man like Luffy?!

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,630
Damn!

113
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,750
Chopper! Don't stop!

114
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,670
Sanji!

115
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,150
Sanji!

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,000
Damn it! They'll all be killed!

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,190
Don't do it, Chopper!

118
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,910
Stop it, you people!

119
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,610
Rumble

120
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,970
Chopper!

121
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,270
That's the thing from back then!

122
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,950
What's this?

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,730
I had heard of this...

124
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,510
That's an interesting power, but...

125
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,590
It seems like you've lost your common sense, huh?

126
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,600
Luffy, watch out!

127
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,790
That Chopper... He did that again?!

128
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,660
I don't know why, but he seems to be distracted by him...

129
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,930
Now's our chance!

130
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,530
Sanji, Brook! Get up!

131
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,510
Let's hurry up and get away from here while we have the chance!

132
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,170
He's gonna fire another beam!

133
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,430
Hey, hurry and wake up, Brook!

134
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,330
Sanji!

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,220
Wait, PX-1.

136
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,650
Another one showed up!

137
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,430
What's going on?!

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
No way!

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,910
How many of these guys are there, anyway?!

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,330
This guy...

141
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,090
...He's the real one!

142
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,630
So, you survived, Roronoa?

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,510
Thanks to your mercy...

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,290
H... Hey, Zoro...

145
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,550
This is no time to be talking...

146
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,290
Hurry!

147
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,990
If you were to go on a vacation, where would you like to go?

148
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,090
Hey, Zoro!

149
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,130
If you don't hurry up and run...

150
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,050
Huh?

151
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,310
Z-Zoro...

152
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,040
Damn you!

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,900
What did you do to Zoro?!

154
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,580
He was...

155
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,020
He was just...

156
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,440
...Right here!

157
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,760
Zoro...?

158
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,500
Z-Zoro?

159
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,210
Zoro?

160
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,100
Zoro!

161
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,320
Zoro!!!

162
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,150
Stop it, Chopper!

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,040
Don't be reckless!

164
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,080
Zoro... Where did you go?!

165
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,280
He doesn't have any self-control...

166
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,500
Regardless, that Kuma boy...

167
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,460
What is that bastard doing here?

168
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,460
Bartholomew Kuma...

169
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,160
This is why you can't trust pirates!

170
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,820
They're surrounded over there, too?

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
Zoro just vanished!

172
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
Does this mean that the real one showed up at last?

173
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,980
There's no mistake...

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
I've seen that ability before...

175
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,120
Back at Thriller Bark, he used that...

176
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,940
...To get rid of a girl...

177
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,960
...Tnd she never came back!

178
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,720
This is really bad!

179
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,080
Hey! What'd he do to Zoro?!

180
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,640
Where'd he disappear off to?!

181
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,030
I have no obligation to answer.

182
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm the most tight-lipped man in the world.

183
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,050
I don't know if it's true or not, but they say that

184
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,910
anyone who gets blasted off by his pads

185
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,600
is sent flying through the sky for three days and nights...

186
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,750
Nobody except the person who was sent flying knows where to, though...

187
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,290
But it definitely won't be on this island...

188
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,560
Or anywhere else where you might meet them anytime soon.

189
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,450
They might end up on the edge of some distant sea.

190
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,380
What?!

191
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,540
Say something, you damned freak!

192
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,270
Where'd you send Zoro?!

193
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,510
So, he finally showed up...

194
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,890
The real Warlord...

195
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,770
There are three of them who look the same...

196
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,240
What's going on?!

197
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,630
Th... The real Warlord...

198
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,360
Don't come any closer!

199
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,110
Damn it... Stop!

200
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,550
I've got 8000 subordinates, you know!

201
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,970
Hey! Can't you hear me?! Don't come any closer!

202
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,380
Look out, Usopp! Behind you!

203
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,850
Behi-?!

204
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,570
Stay out of this.

205
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,710
He even got rid of his own comrade?!

206
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,670
Even PX-1?!

207
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,970
What're you doing with your allies, Kuma boy?!

208
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,450
Run, the three of you!!

209
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,690
Luffy!

210
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,780
Just run away, everyone!

211
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,630
We'll think things over once we're safe!

212
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,470
Go!!!

213
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,450
Hey, let's go!

214
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,050
But... Zoro...

215
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,120
Like he said, we'll think about that later!

216
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,970
Let's go!

217
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,590
Let's go! The beam only grazed me!

218
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,030
I'll lend you my shoulder, quick!

219
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,470
Be careful, you two!

220
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,690
Brook!

221
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,370
Brook!!

222
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,210
I shall protect you!

223
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,910
Even if it costs me my life!!

224
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,340
...Though I am already d-

225
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,190
Brook!!!

226
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,690
Damn it... What am I doing?!

227
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,770
Two of my comrades just vanished before my eyes!

228
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
Damn it!

229
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,630
Get going, Usopp!

230
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,190
Don't be ridiculous! We're leaving together, Sanji!

231
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,330
Why, you...!

232
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,430
Stop it, Sanji!

233
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,270
Damn pad-bastard!!

234
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,530
Sanji!

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,150
Stay away!

236
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,620
Stay away!

237
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,470
Stay away!

238
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,240
Gunpowder Star!

239
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,320
Gunpowder Star!

240
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,780
Damn!

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,060
Gunpowder Star!

242
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,260
Gunpowder Star!

243
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,200
Gunpowder Star!

244
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,460
Gunpowder Star!

245
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,140
Usopp!

246
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,080
Run!

247
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,540
Run!!

248
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,500
Usopp!

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,060
Sanji?

250
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,480
Damn it to hell!

251
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,240
Stop it, Sanji!

252
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,740
Even Sanji...

253
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,140
What's going on...?

254
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,360
What are we gonna do?

255
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,800
No way...

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,060
Everyone's...

257
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,820
The situation over there seems pretty hopeless...

258
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,920
I'd like to help them out, but I'm getting too old...

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,720
You're holding off a navy admiral on your own,
and you're still trying to do more?

260
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,920
You're making me look bad here, so just cut it out already!

261
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,120
You are the "Dark King", Rayleigh, are you not?

262
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,660
Huh?

263
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,960
Kuma?

264
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,660
Luffy?

265
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,960
You really expect me to believe what you just said?

266
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
Decide that for yourself.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,400
I am already endangering my own position.

268
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,060
Just what're you planning to do, Kuma?

269
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,740
As long as it doesn't directly affect the World Government...

270
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,160
We have no obligation to get along with the navy.

271
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,600
I will not answer that question.

272
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,680
You bastard!

273
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,410
Gear Second!

274
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,140
Get out of our way!

275
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,520
Strong Right!

276
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,140
What?!

277
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Wait!

278
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,640
You can't, Luffy!

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
Rubber

280
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,000
Jet Pistol!

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,340
No!!!

282
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,080
Luffy! Help!

283
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,740
Nami!!!

284
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,800
Luffy!

285
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,420
Chopper...

286
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,420
Chopper!!!

287
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,980
Chopper...

288
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Stop it...

289
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,360
Stop it...

290
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,360
Stop it...

291
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,320
Please, stop it!!!

292
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,460
Luffy!

293
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,000
Robin!!!

294
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,640
Luffy!!

295
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,960
I couldn't even...

296
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,340
...Save a single one of my friends!

297
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,380
So, you're gonna send him off and be done with it?

298
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,020
I hope you have a good explanation for this.

299
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,120
This is a huge problem, you know?

300
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,400
We will never...

301
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,800
...Meet again.

302
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,580
Farewell.

303
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,300
Grand Line...

304
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,300
Sabaody Archipelago...

305
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,560
Grove 12...

306
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,080
On this day...

307
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,490
...The pirate crew, led by captain Monkey D. Luffy...

308
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,610
...The Straw Hat Pirates...

309
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,960
...Were completely and utterly defeated.
