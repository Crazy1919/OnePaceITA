I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550

I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
Roger and Rayleigh

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,060
Wait!

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,860
What's going on here?! Save me!

23
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,100
Good grief...

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,120
There are even more of them than I thought.

25
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,160
You guys sure have some weird powers!

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,250
Yours is the strangest of all.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,940
Really?

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,520
I can't believe that the mortar cannons didn't work on all three of them!

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,920
Seems like they've earned their reputations!

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
Think this is the time to be impressed?!

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,520
Somehow, we've got to hold them off until Admiral Kizaru arrives!

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,700
Think we're gonna wait for that?

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,200
A head!

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Wait, don't throw me!

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,220
How can you talk?!

36
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,440
I don't know!

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,160
Also, my body feels hot for some reason...

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,090
Your body?!

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,360
You have a body?!

40
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,160
His body is burning up over there!

41
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
It's so hot!

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,500
My body is burning!

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,120
You can feel it?!

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Will someone pour some water on him?

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,960
I thought I was gonna die...

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,600
Everyone, be careful!

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,440
That guy...

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,960
Don't get into the circles he creates!

49
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,200
Room.

50
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,680
Y-You mean this?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah, it's this thing...

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,920
We were cut!

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,540
What's going on here?!

54
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,160
Just relax...

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,030
This'll be over soon.

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,310
Bone Balloon!

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,720
This arm is the arm of a giant!

58
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,460
Don't hesitate!

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,700
Ready your weapons!

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,400
Shoot!

61
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,940
Shoot all of them!

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,580
But Commodore!

63
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,660
Our weapons...

64
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,660
They're flying away!

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,430
W-What the...?!

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,980
What?

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,540
What's with that guy?!

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,370
This is no time to get distracted.

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
W-What the?!

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Hey, that's my leg!

71
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,330
Then whose leg is that?!

72
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,660
You've got too many torsos!

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,500
Like I didn't know that!

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,700
Giant Pistol

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,320
Eat this!

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,830
Hey!

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,180
It's already this bad?

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
Amazing!

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,700
My eyes must be deceiving me!

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,180
Oh, man...

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,010
You're overdoing it, Captain...

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,920
Why, these guys aren't half bad.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,560
They sure are impatient...

84
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,940
Hey, what happened to you, Straw Hat?

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,600
You're ruining the mood.

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,310
Really?

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,260
Well, I guess we've pretty much ruined their formation now.

88
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,580
Commodore, it seems all the pirates have come out of the auction house.

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,360
They're planning to run away!

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
Well, these brats shouldn't underestimate us!

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,180
Our reinforcements are on their way!

92
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,340
We've gotten the three hostages out through the back door.

93
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,090
Aim the mortar cannons at the people who don't have abilities!

94
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
Firing squad, get behind them!

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,520
All forces, prepare to attack!

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,500
Take out these pirates!

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Here they come.

98
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,900
The enemy seems to have run out of strategies.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Now it's just a brawl.

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,460
I'm back to normal!

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
Well, see ya later, Straw Hat.

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,880
It was a pleasure meeting you in person...

103
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,580
But I won't show you any mercy the next time we meet!

104
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,940
But I'll be the one who finds One Piece!

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,240
Hey, Kid!

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
What are you just standing around for?!

107
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,680
Hey, Killer.

108
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,780
On the route that we took to get here...

109
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,660
Whenever we said we were gonna find One Piece, people just laughed at us...

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Although I killed anyone who dared to laugh...

111
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,200
But after this...

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,660
we're going to an ocean where anyone who doesn't have the guts to say it will die.

113
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,370
Let's meet again in the New World!

114
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,880
Let's go, you guys!

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,860
Yeah!

116
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,470
Trafalgar Law!

117
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,020
How dare you do that to my mate back then?!

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,980
Bepo.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
Huh?

120
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,580
Captain, are you going back there?

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,260
Oh, Sanji!

122
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,700
Luffy, look over there!

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,640
Hey!

124
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,460
Young master and friends!

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,250
Flying Fish guys!

126
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,600
Huh?

127
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,280
Did you just say I'm handsome?

128
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,500
More importantly, we're all set to go!

129
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,420
Aren't we, men?

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,300
Yes!

131
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,020
Life is rosy!

132
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm not too happy about relying on those guys again,

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
but I guess we've got to hurry.

134
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,700
Right, let's go!

135
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,200
There's no choice!

136
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,780
Lullaby Parry

137
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,960
The two of you, hurry and go while you have the chance!

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah...

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,580
Don't fall asleep!

140
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,900
Are you an ally of the pirates, you scum?!

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,960
N-No, I'm not!

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,100
I ain't even a pirate!

143
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,820
Neuve Fleurs

144
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,820
{\an8}Nine flowers

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,520
What?

146
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,800
Twist

147
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,640
T'was scary...!

148
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,960
Head!

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,720
He was traumatized back when Navy HQ tried to kill him, and yet...

150
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,180
He endured it, huh?

151
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,340
That's amazing!

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,940
Shaddup!

153
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,400
Think this be the right time to be talkin' about traumas and stuff like that?

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,440
We've got to help the young masters, whom I owe my life to, out of this pinch!

155
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,600
Old man, Franky, go on ahead!

156
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
Sure, thanks!

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Don't let them get away!

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,900
How many of them are there, anyway?!

159
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,700
My blood is boiling!

160
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,320
You sure are an energetic old man!

161
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,720
Hey, hurry up, the three of you!

162
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Sure!

163
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,420
Don't let the Straw Hat Crew get away!

164
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
They're responsible for all this!

165
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
Shoot them! Shoot them!!!

166
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,220
What is that?

167
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,600
Thunderbolt Tempo

168
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
That's Saint Rosward's slave!

169
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,860
How'd he get those chains off?

170
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
Wanna come with me,

171
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,560
pirate, Captain Jean Bart?

172
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,080
It's been a long time since anyone called me that!

173
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,280
As long as it means that you'll free me from the Celestial Dragons,

174
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,820
I'll gladly become your subordinate!

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,400
You should save half of that graditude for the Straw Hats.

176
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,300
They're still following us, even after we destroyed the bridge...

177
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,520
Of course they are.

178
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,800
The marines will probably be there when we return to the city, too.

179
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,050
Let's hurry and get off the island.

180
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,560
Kid!

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960
Chief Kid!

182
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,840
Up there.

183
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,200
It can't be...

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,140
Why...

185
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,860
are you on this island?!

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
What a quick witted bear!

187
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
We can't even touch him!

188
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,300
How can a bear speak?!

189
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm sorry...

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,140
He's too sensitive!

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,220
Hurry up, Bepo!

192
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,280
Damn!

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,600
They destroyed the bridge!

194
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,100
You're new, so you're my subordinate.

195
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,620
As long as I'm not a slave, anything is fine!

196
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,400
Captain, look at that!

197
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,400
Eustass and...

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
That's...!

199
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,180
What's one of the Seven Warlords doing in a place like this?!

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,260
Trafalgar Law...

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,920
So, you know my name?

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,120
Captain!

203
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
We're right next to Navy HQ and Mariejoa...

204
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,520
It wouldn't be strange running into anyone here.

205
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,440
The marines are coming at us from behind!

206
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,800
This guy isn't gonna let us pass, is he?

207
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,440
Trafalgar, you're in my way!

208
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,260
You want me to kill you?

209
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,740
I told you not to order me around, didn't I?

210
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,180
I'm running into a lot of big shots today...

211
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,660
I don't wanna meet an admiral on top of all this, so...

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,960
I shall make you let us pass...

213
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,460
...Bartholomew Kuma!

214
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,790
Grove 8 


















Hound Pets Hideout

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,120
Are you alive, Peterman-san?!

216
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,280
How could they do this to our boss?!

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,460
Damn it!

218
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,420
But...

219
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,410
I never thought Duval would look 
so handsome under his iron mask!

220
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,970
Then, if you ever need anything, just call me!

221
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,280
We'll be your arms and legs until you're ready to go to Fishman Island!

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,800
Sure!

223
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,240
Thanks a lot, you guys!

224
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,620
Don't mention it.

225
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,920
Stop winking already.

226
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,840
Also...

227
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,880
This belongs to the mermaid, right?

228
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,440
My backpack!

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,240
That idiot, Peterman had it.

230
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
Thank you!

231
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,680
Now, let's go, Rosy-life riders!

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,530
Yes, Handrosy!

233
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,800
They've got quite a few different names for him, huh?

234
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,810
They're probably still trying to find a good one.

235
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,070
Let's hurry and get inside.

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,030
We've got to stabilize Hachi!

237
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,780
Hey, Shakki!

238
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,260
We're back!

239
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh, Ray-san, welcome back.

240
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,420
That was fast.

241
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,300
I'm really impressed that you guys found him, Monkey-chan.

242
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,000
Hachi is badly injured, so we've got to get him to the bed fast.

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,900
What happened?

244
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,670
Never mind, I'll get a bed ready for him.

245
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,730
What?!

246
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,150
On the pirate king's ship?!

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,480
Yes...

248
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,940
I was the vice-captain.

249
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,420
I'm Silvers Rayleigh.

250
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,450
Nice to meet you.

251
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,250
Vice-captain?!

252
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,440
You didn't tell them, Hacchan?

253
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,500
We only needed him to coat the ship...

254
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,580
Oh, you didn't notice?

255
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,880
I totally know that name!

256
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,880
It's written down in so many books...

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,010
That's definitely a name everyone's heard at least once...

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,340
Gold Roger?

259
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,960
There might have been a rookie 
by that name, or maybe there wasn't...

260
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,440
How does that octopus know a big shot like you?

261
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, Hachi helped me out once when I was stranded at sea over 20 years ago.

262
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,540
He saved his life.

263
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,680
He was just a child at the time, though.

264
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,000
Hachi and I used to get along pretty well before he joined the Sun Pirates.

265
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,430
Arlong's crew, right?

266
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,560
But...

267
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,440
If Gold Roger was executed 22 years ago...

268
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,580
How come you, the vice-captain, are still alive?

269
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,980
Your crew was captured by the navy, right?

270
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,920
We weren't captured.

271
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,660
Roger surrendered to them.

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,560
I suppose the government claimed that they'd "captured" him, to show their power.

273
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,300
The Pirate King surrendered?!

274
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,180
Why?!

275
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,680
He could see the end of our journey.

276
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,480
It was probably about four years before he was executed...

277
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,460
Roger caught an incurable disease.

278
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
Huh?

279
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,400
It was a disease that nobody could cure or stabilize.

280
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,720
Even Roger suffered from it, but...

281
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,960
But one man, the most well-known doctor of his time...

282
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,100
A man called Crocus of the Twin Capes, had the skill to ease his suffering.

283
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,700
We asked him for help, and he joined as the ship's doctor for our last journey.

284
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,180
And then, three years later, while holding off Roger's disease...

285
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,940
We did what they said was impossible, and conquered the Grand Line.

286
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,900
C-C-Crocus-san?!

287
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,890
From the Twin Capes...

288
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,310
Oh, how nostalgic!

289
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,400
What?!

290
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,300
I thought that old man had been at those capes for fifty years!

291
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,380
So he was part of the Pirate King's crew?

292
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,820
Come to think of it, he did say he'd been a ship's doctor for a while.

293
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,570
So he was a pirate for those three years?

294
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,180
If you met him, then that must mean that he's still well.

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,580
Crocus only had one condition...

296
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,720
That we let him look for a certain pirate crew whom he wanted to find.

297
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,160
Hey, Brook!

298
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,500
That must mean he went off to sea to look for you guys!

299
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,160
So Crocus-san even did something like that for us?

300
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,520
He was only a crew member for three years...

301
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,880
But he was, without a doubt, our comrade.

302
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,020
At my age, I would really like to see him again.

303
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,770
So, what happened after you conquered the sea?

304
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,700
After that...

305
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,580
Roger became known all over the world as the Pirate King.

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,600
It's not like he'd been called the Pirate King all along.

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,360
Titles like that didn't mean much for a man on the verge of death...

308
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,520
But, Roger was happy about it.

309
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,540
He was a man who loved doing everything in grand style...

310
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,460
Be it celebrations or battles...

311
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,220
Even though he knew he wouldn't live much longer, he seemed to enjoy himself...

312
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,460
Eventually, at the captains orders, the Roger Pirates disbanded.

313
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,120
We all went our separate ways, and one after another, everyone disappeared.

314
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:37,060
I have no idea what our comrades whom we risked our lives with are now, nor what they are doing.

315
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,740
Then, one year after the crew dissolved...

316
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,280
Roger turned himself in and was arrested.

317
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,220
It was decided that he would be executed in the town he was born in...

318
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,880
Loguetown in East Blue.

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,460
I hear that on that day...

320
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,180
Countless pirates who are famous today...

321
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,160
Were gathered in the square.

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,640
The Pirate King's execution was the center of attention for the world.

323
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,400
I didn't go.

324
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,560
These were the last words he said to me...

325
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,020
I'm not gonna die, partner.

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm sure both the world government and the navy were surprised.

327
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,380
They had intended for the execution to be a warning to all the pirates who saw it...

328
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,880
But Roger's last words raised the curtain on the Great Pirate Era!

329
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,540
My treasures?

330
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
If you want them, they're yours!

331
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,780
Look for them!

332
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,140
I left it all at that place.

333
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,000
Just a few seconds before the flame of his life went out, it flickered...

334
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,320
And he turned it into a blazing flare that covered the entire world.

335
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,500
I've never laughed as hard as I did that night.

336
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,980
I've never cried as much as I did that night...

337
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
Nor have I ever drank as much as I did that night.

338
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,440
He led a marvelous life as my captain!

339
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,340
Seems like we just heard quite the story...

340
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,980
It sounds like a completely different story coming from someone who was involved...

341
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,000
Then, it's almost as though Roger intended to start this pirate-era!

342
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,440
I can't say anything for sure about that.

343
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,860
Roger died.

344
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,960
The ones creating the current era are those who live right now.

345
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm sure there were a lot of people who received something from Roger in the square that day.

346
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,820
Shanks, whom you know well, was one of them.

347
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,920
Pops, you know Shanks?

348
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,840
If you're from East Blue, then maybe you know a pirate named Buggy as well?

349
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,010
Buggy!

350
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,480
Those two were swabbies aboard our ship.

351
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,420
Shanks was on the pirate king's ship?!

352
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
What, he didn't tell you?

353
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,140
It was about ten years ago...

354
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,020
I encountered him by chance on this island...

355
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,380
He'd lost his trademark straw hat and his left arm.

356
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,460
When I asked him why, he excitedly started telling me about you.

357
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,920
Rayleigh-san, I was really surprised...

358
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,220
There was a kid in East Blue who said the exact same thing Captain Roger said.

359
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,600
Those exact same words as the captain!

360
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,860
Sabaody Archipelago


















Grove 27

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,080
I see a warship approaching the port!

The admiral has arrived!

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,960
