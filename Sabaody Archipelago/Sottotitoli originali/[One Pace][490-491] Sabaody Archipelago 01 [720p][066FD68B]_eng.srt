I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,280
Flying Fish Riders

21
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,780
See you guys later!

22
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,600
We'll never forget what you did for us, Straw Hat!

23
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,400
The sun...! Thanks for giving us the sun back!

24
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,760
Everyone! Be careful to not get yourselves wiped out!

25
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,040
Don't say crazy stuff like that!

26
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,240
Lola! Thanks for the Vivrecard! Stay well!

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,100
If you meet Mama, give her my regards!

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,060
Let's meet again someday, Namizou!

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,420
Set sail!

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,680
No one truly knows what happens in this mysterious sea, the Florian Triangle...

31
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,900
They're gone...

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,600
Seems like it.

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,300
Now that that's over, let's set sail tomorrow!

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,210
Yeah!

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
Every year, over 100 ships vanish in the mist.

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,340
This started long before the enormous pirate ship, Thriller Bark, started hiding in the mist ten years ago.

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,560
It is a deep, ancient mystery...

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
It is lucky that the mist is as thick as ever this day...

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,620
For that strange face in the sea is concealed by its thick white veil...

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,050
Luffy...

41
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,120
Is this really okay with you?

42
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,740
Huh?

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,430
Ah, about Ace's paper, huh?

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,000
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,890
Luffy-san, I would have no objections if you wished to take a detour!

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,100
Time is of no great importance to Laboon and myself!

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,690
To "live" and "meet once more"... That is all that matters!

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,660
Luffy, we're all totally fine if you want to take a detour!

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,720
It's fine, it's fine!

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,300
Yeah! Let's go see your whale of a brother!

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,200
No, it's fine, really!

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,140
Even if he was in some kind of trouble, he wouldn't want me to worry...

53
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,680
Ace hates being made to look weak!

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,020
If we went to help him, he'd just get pissed off.

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
If we do meet up, it'll be as enemy pirates!

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,780
Ace has his own adventure.

57
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,310
That "Vivre Card" apparently doesn't just shrink when the owner's in bad condition...

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,540
It goes back to how it was once they recover.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,860
Yeah! If we meet, it'll be at that time.

60
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,300
That's why Ace gave me this paper, right?

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Oh, and Zoro!

62
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,720
You were asleep all along, so we haven't done this yet!

63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
Well, let's do it properly then!

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,480
To celebrate the recruitment of our new companion, the musician Brook...

65
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,360
Cheers!

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,580
Most obliged!

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Alright! Pull in the sails! We'll launch our way out of here with the Coup de Burst!

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,300
Coup de Burst!

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
What is this?!

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,760
Holy Land, Mariejoa

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,140
Don't be ridiculous!

72
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,240
Bartholomew Kuma, are you telling me that they managed to escape from your powers?!

73
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,680
I want a better explanation than that! I'm the one who has to report this to the higher-ups!

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,100
Just what I expected from my grandson!

75
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,600
Garp, be quiet!

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,760
You were given a special Government order to eliminate the whole crew,

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,140
yet you couldn't even bring back Straw Hat Luffy's head? This is a disgrace!

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Don't worry about that, Sengoku!

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,280
Luffy isn't the kind of guy who would go around bragging about defeating Moriah anyway!

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,580
Hmph!

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,900
Kuma, I hope you didn't take pity on those pirates just because they were injured.

82
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,460
Because you've failed to take this seriously, this game of cat-and-mouse will have no end.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,020
If they continue blindly following the Log, as they are now, they will draw ever closer to the Navy HQ.

84
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh, yeah, by the way... I brought the new tea!

85
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,660
Get out the crackers!

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Garp, will you be quiet?!

87
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,310
A few days later

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,870
Grand Line

89
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,480
Thousand Sunny

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Serpent currents!

91
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,540
Serpent... currents?

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,340
Everyone, be careful!

93
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
Let's go, everyone!

94
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,880
That's...

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,170
Coup de Burst!

96
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,740
We're here...

97
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,170
We've finally made it this far!

98
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,360
It feels kind of nostalgic...

99
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,780
I can't see the top! It's huge!

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,740
So this is the Red Line?

101
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,140
I wonder if we've matured since then?

102
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,280
I kinda feel like crying!

103
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
A lot of stuff has happened, huh?

104
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,640
Anyways, now we're halfway there!

105
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,660
The Twin Capes on the other side of the world, where we met Laboon, is connected to this spot!

106
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,280
Current location

107
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,600
It's great that we've all made it this far, huh?

108
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,560
I was told I came over Reverse Mountain from South Blue when I was just a kid...

109
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,840
But I guess that's a 30 year old tale.

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,720
I came to this sea from West Blue, five years ago.

111
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,220
When we've crossed the other half of the world, and see this wall again...

112
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
At that time...

113
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,540
I'll be the Pirate King! {Starts Late}

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
But we've got to be careful now.

115
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,980
This place is close to the "Holy Land" of the World Government and the Navy HQ, Mariejoa.

116
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,440
This "surprise-pool" is the best!

117
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,210
I'm too weak.

118
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,080
I have to become stronger!

119
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,060
I'm still far too weak!

120
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm still...!

121
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,100
How is it, Robin, Brook, Luffy?

122
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,780
No use. It's completely black.

123
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,780
It's totally black out there!

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
Hey, I think I saw something there!

125
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,540
Was that the eyeball of a monster?

126
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,560
A-a monster?

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,720
W-We are going to die!

128
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,090
Although I am already dead!

129
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh, by the way, Nami-san? I have a question...

130
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
What panties are you wearing today?

131
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,060
Shut up! Take this seriously!

132
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,760
Scary...!

133
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,540
He's a plucky guy, huh?

134
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,900
Hey, you guys! The Shark Submerge can't go any deeper than 5,000 metres, so be careful!

135
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,980
Hmm? The hull seems to be creaking.

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,570
Yes, it's because...

137
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,060
we're deeper than 5,000 metres right now.

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Ah, that means...

139
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,400
But that is terrible! We are going to be crushed by the water-pressure!

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,820
Oh! The monster from earlier! It's still here!

141
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
What a big mouth it has.

142
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,500
Watch out!

143
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,120
It's gonna eat us!

144
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,160
Here it comes again!

145
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
This sounds pretty bad...

146
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,020
I don't want to ride the Shark Submerge...

147
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,810
Me neither.

148
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,680
Nami-swan!

149
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,780
The "Horror-Nashi Tarte" from Thriller Bark is done!

150
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Oh, it looks good!

151
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,560
But this is a problem...

152
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,600
It tastes great!

153
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,560
It's good!

154
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,160
It's the same problem we had with Sky Island.

155
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,020
That's right...

156
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,420
We know the direction we have to take,

157
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,760
but we have no idea how we're gonna get there.

158
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,480
How are we gonna reach Fishman Island?

159
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,020
We're back!

160
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
That was fun!

161
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,660
Welcome back! Good work!

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,340
It's no use!

163
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,540
We can't see anything on the bottom of the sea at all. Is Fishman Island really there?

164
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,440
That was my first time riding a submarine.

165
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,400
If we'd have gone further down, the pressure would have killed us.

166
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,600
The Log Pose is certainly pointing straight down, but...

167
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,760
This is no good... I should have gotten some more info from Lola and the others.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,380
It's that thing from earlier!

169
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,140
It followed us!

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't think you can beat me when we're above the water!

171
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,340
Rubber...

172
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,880
Rifle!

173
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,390
Somehow, he didn't seem all that huge.

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,100
Because we dealt with Oars! Seems like we're fine.

175
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,300
Something came out.

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,140
A fish?

177
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,720
A person?!

178
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,400
No, that is wrong...

179
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,400
That's a...

180
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,140
C-Could it be?!

181
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,500
Ah! I crushed a human!

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm so sorry! Are you OK?

183
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Oh, don't worry about it~!

184
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,800
Anyway, who are...

185
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,880
{\an8}Please pull yourself together! Are you OK?

186
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,840
That's...

187
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,680
{\an8}I can't believe I did something like that! Please pull yourself together!

188
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,140
A fin...

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,620
Could it really be...?

190
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,960
A mermaid?!

191
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,020
What a shock! There are so many humans here!

192
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,460
W-What?

193
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,140
W-We're surprised too!

194
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,310
Camie

195
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,310
Kissing Gourami
Mermaid

196
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,310
(Designer Apprentice,

197
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,310
Takoyaki Shop Employee)

198
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,040
{\an8}I thought I was going to be digested. Thank you for saving me.

199
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,660
{\an8}I keep getting swallowed by monsters.

200
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,700
This was probably the 20th time.

201
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,580
You get eaten too much!

202
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,880
I have to repay you somehow.

203
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,920
Oh, I know! Would you like some takoyaki?

204
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,260
Takoyaki?! That's my favorite food!

205
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,660
Really?! Then that'll be 500 belly per person!

206
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,220
Hey, you're selling them?!

207
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,100
I screwed up!

208
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,680
Mermaid~! Mermaid~!

209
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,580
Mermaids, the dream of all mankind! Mermaids, the jewels of the ocean!

210
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,300
Yes, I've finally gotten to meet one of them!

211
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,020
She's so cute~!

212
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,700
This is the first time I've ever met one!

213
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Camie, was it?

214
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,540
It's not the first time.

215
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,400
You met old lady Kokoro, didn't you?

216
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,120
Thriller Bark? No, that wasn't scary. Not scary at all.

217
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,220
The scariest thing we've encountered so far was...

218
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,340
Uh, that's right, Sanji! Let's just pretend that never happened!

219
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,080
This is the first mermaid we've ever met!

220
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,420
You guys are so rude!

221
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,960
Huh? Old lady Kokoro was a mermaid?

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,880
But she could walk, couldn't she?

223
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,000
I see... You didn't know, huh?

224
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,180
Well, it happened while you were fighting that Lucci fellow after all.

225
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,500
Imagining old lady Kokoro as a mermaid is really gross for some reason.

226
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,340
You are too freaking blunt!

227
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
Geez, when it comes to this guy's expectations of mermaids...

228
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,180
But she seems like a cute mermaid, doesn't she?

229
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,560
This is my first encounter with a mermaid too.

230
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,280
Excuse me, would you please lend me some money?

231
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
Why would she?!

232
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,540
A skeleton!

233
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
See?! How are you gonna make it up if you scare her?! Get lost!

234
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,240
I can open my head as well. Isn't that funny?

235
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,680
Why you...!

236
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,900
That's so funny!

237
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,760
She sure got over that quickly.

238
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,800
By the way, can you poop?

239
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,700
What are you trying to ask, damn you?!

240
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,460
Ah, well, I...

241
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,520
Don't answer!

242
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
{\an8}She does not poop!

243
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,500
Camie? Camie? This is just weird...

244
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,100
Aren't you missing someone?

245
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,900
Who's the one left out of this fun group?

246
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,340
Answer: Me.

247
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
That's right. I was wondering about this...

248
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,100
Hey, Camie, what's this?
This talking glove-thingy...

249
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,520
Oh, sorry. I completely forgot.
He's my pet, Pappag.

250
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,400
He's a starfish, and he's my master.

251
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,280
Nice to meet you!

252
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Can starfish talk?

253
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,500
Isn't it strange for her pet to be her master?

254
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,900
Well, I was taken in, and with reason.

255
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,280
Camie always feeds me clams

256
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
So she feeds you?

257
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:35,500
Am I a person? I'm a starfish, yet I'm not a human.

258
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Am I not a person? I'm not a person, but I am a starfish.

259
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,870
Are you busy? No, it's fine.

260
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,040
We've got enough hands around here.

261
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,620
Yay, thank you!

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
This is where you're supposed to laugh!

263
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,360
So, this T-shirt is of the "Criminal" brand, and it's really popular on Fishman Island these days.

264
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,540
Oh?

265
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,740
That's pretty cool.

266
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,880
Pappug designed it!

267
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,560
I want to become a designer one day too!

268
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
You will! You'll definitely make it, Camie!

269
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,330
Thank you, Sanji!

270
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,100
Nobody listens to me...

271
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,180
Oh yeah, you. How can you talk?

272
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm glad you asked!

273
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,580
Back when I was a kid, I always thought I was a human.

274
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,580
By the time I found out that I was actually a starfish, I was already speaking the human language!

275
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,620
Does it really work like that?

276
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,220
Ah, the world works in strange and frightening ways. That's just how the world is!

277
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
Pappag

278
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
The starfish

279
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
(Criminal brand
designer)

280
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,280
Anyway, I'm Pappag the starfish!

281
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,260
Up-and-coming designer.

282
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Thanks for saving me!

283
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,320
What a relief! We were having trouble figuring out what to do. I want to ask you something...

284
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,040
Hey, Nami! The takoyaki comes first!

285
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,660
Ah, that's right! The takoyaki to show my gratitude!

286
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,860
Well, I've got to meet up with Hacchin somewhere.

287
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,280
Hacchin?

288
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,360
Hello, Hacchin? This is Camie!

289
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Sorry I got kinda lost. Where are you right now?

290
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,020
Oh, that voice must be Camie, right?

291
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,160
Hacchin?

292
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,780
Do you know who you're talking to?
This ain't Hacchin, y'know!

293
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,820
You're not Hacchin?!

294
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,140
This is Macro! From the simple-minded Macro Crew! Wait, I shouldn't say that myself...

295
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,180
Seems like trouble.

296
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,040
Why do you have Hacchin's Transponder Snail?

297
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
'Cause we beat up Hachi! Isn't it obvious?!

298
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,440
Liar! There is no way Hacchin would lose to you guys!

299
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,960
Yeah, you have a point. Usually, we'd be no match for him,

300
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,060
but this time, we had the Flying Fish Riders on our side!

301
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
The Flying Fish Riders?!

302
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,540
Camie, are you still alright? Thank goodness.

303
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,980
Hacchin! Did they really beat you?

304
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
I let my guard down.

305
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,060
Don't come here! I'll take out these guys and come straight back! It'll be fine!

306
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,080
Y'know, Camie, we're just about to sell this guy.

307
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,140
Octopus Fishmen are pretty rare, so he should fetch us quite the price.

308
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,420
Feel free to come and save him!

309
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,840
We're at the Sabaody Archipelago, in the waters five kilometres east of grove 44.

310
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,380
This is where the Flying Fish Riders' base is!

311
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,440
No! Camie, don't come here!

312
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,640
Shut up, you damn octopus!

313
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,870
See ya!

314
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,560
Hacchin...

315
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,980
So what about the takoyaki?

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,980
This isn't the time for that!

317
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,280
Wait... The voice of that Hacchin guy we just heard on the Transponder-Snail. It seemed kinda familiar...

318
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,400
It's just my imagination, right? There's no way...

319
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,660
Sorry, Luffy-chin. Can we do takoyaki later?

320
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,480
I've got to go save my friend!

321
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,520
Huh?

322
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,340
Hey!

323
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,160
Wait, Camie.

324
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,100
I shouldn't be meddling here, but if you want to save your friend, then we'll help you!

325
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,480
No, that's wrong. I mean, they'll help you!

326
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
Why, you...!

327
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,280
And in exchange, how about you help us get to Fishman Island?

328
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,100
Really, Nami-chin?

329
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,560
You're gonna help me save Hacchin, Luffy-chin?

330
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,020
Well, I'm fine with it. But who is this Hacchin anyway?

331
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
He runs the Takoyaki store I work at.

332
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,800
Our takoyaki is the best in the world!

333
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,960
That's important!

334
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
Men! Even if it costs you your lives, we're gonna save the takoyaki!

335
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,940
Yeah!

336
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
They say it's okay. So, do you know where they are?

337
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,560
Yeah, let's see...

338
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,640
Grove 44 is an island at the very eastern edge of the archipelago.

339
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,660
5 kilometres west from there. I guess the Flying Fish Riders' base would be about here.

340
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Seeing how we're about here right now...

341
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,040
If we head straight for the Sabaody Archipelago from here, we should pass it on the way.

342
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,760
So, let's head west!

343
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,400
Afterwards we can ask the fish, and figure it out.

344
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,180
Yeah, that's right. Let's hurry and go!

345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Hey!

346
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,700
Wow! The fish are sticking their heads out!

347
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
We want you to lead the way!

348
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,620
They say they're afraid of the Flying Fish and won't take us all the way, but will show us the direction.

349
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,660
Incredible! You can talk to fish?

350
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,100
I had no idea mermaids could do that!

351
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,940
Camie, if you were around, we could eat as much fish as we wanted!

352
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,600
Watch your mouth. I'll beat you senseless.

353
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,920
But how do we follow the fish in the sea anyway?

354
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,160
Well, just take a look!

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
Awesome!

356
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,420
They can do this? I don't believe it!

357
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,520
The fish are drawing an arrow on the sea!

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,780
Fantastic! We just have to follow this, right?

359
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,220
You're awesome, Camie!

360
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,660
No, I have a long way to go.

361
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,780
No, this is really impressive!

362
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
Alright! Then, I'll take the helm!

363
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,300
Turn it around to 4 o'clock.

364
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,560
Right!

365
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,150
Zoro!

366
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,920
Are we already setting off? Does it look like we can make it to Fishman Island?

367
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,760
Forget that, and look here. It's Camie the mermaid! She's real! Awesome, right?

368
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,740
Hello!

369
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
A mermaid?

370
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,320
First time I've seen one.

371
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,800
He erased it! He just... erased his memory!

372
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,760
But I'm worried.

373
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,040
Hacchin sounded like he had trouble talking. I'm sure they've done something awful to him.

374
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,400
Well, he's tough, so it should be alright.

375
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,480
Anyway, you guys were pretty quick to offer your help, but are you sure you can handle this?

376
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,260
Yeah! We're strong.

377
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,800
I should warn you, there's not just one gang of kidnappers around here.

378
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,360
Human trading is big business on Sabaody Archipelago.

379
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,260
Selling human lives? That's horrible!

380
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,540
And seeing how mermaids are particularly valuable,

381
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,220
the Macro crew, a gang of three fishmen, have been after Camie for a while now.

382
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,840
Hachi from the Takoyaki shop probably thought we were kidnapped by the Macro Crew

383
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,160
and went after them, since we'd been missing for a while after we were eaten by that monster.

384
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,320
That's probably it.

385
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
Hacchin is a kind, straight-forward person after all.

386
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,820
It's my fault.

387
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,700
Hearing about this octopus named Hachi,
I can't help but think of that stupid fishman.

388
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,040
If it's really him, then we're not gonna help.

389
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, there's no way...

390
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,640
Usually, Hachi could beat those guys easily...

391
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,880
But who'd have thought the Flying Fish Riders would help them?

392
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,380
Who're they?

393
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,980
Another kidnapping gang who started causing a lot of trouble around these parts recently.

394
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,620
They say that if they target you, you're doomed.

395
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
Their boss, Duval, is a guy with an iron mask.

396
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,060
Nobody knows what he really looks like.

397
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,140
It seems like they're looking for someone.

398
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,920
They check every single ship that passes this area.

399
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Well, anyway, there's no need for you to worry, Camie. We'll definitely save the takoyaki!

400
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
It's the takoyaki seller!

401
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,840
Thank you, Luffy-chin!

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Well then, Brook! Play a song to get us in the mood!

403
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,600
With pleasure!

404
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,540
Huh? Is that...?

405
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,620
Hey! We're in trouble!

406
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,640
What's wrong, Camie?

407
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,760
The fish said, "We're sorry, but we can't take you any further."

408
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,520
They're here! The Flying Fish Riders!

409
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,140
Where? I can't see anything!

410
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,020
Wrong! They're not in the sea, but in the air!

411
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,480
The fish are flying!

412
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,860
So cool!

413
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Is this the time to be impressed?!

414
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,680
Damn, they're gonna attack us!

415
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,480
So the "Flying Fish" really can fly?!

416
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,320
Hey, did you see that?!

417
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,680
I saw it! No doubt, that's the Straw Hat Pirates!

418
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Contact him right now!

419
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,000
Understood.

420
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,580
We only came here to find a single mermaid, but this must be our lucky day!

421
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,100
Master Duval is gonna be overjoyed!

422
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,460
Here they come again!

423
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,680
Don't come any closer!

424
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,840
Bombs, huh?

425
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,980
Damn those guys!

426
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,540
Rubber...

427
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,100
72 Pound Canon!

428
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,700
Pistol!

429
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,820
That was close.

430
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,940
Be careful! Once the flying fish jump out of the water, they can stay in the air for five minutes!

431
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,530
Flying Fish Riders'
Hideout

432
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,760
Hey, Macro.

433
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,640
Yes, Duval, my lord.

434
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,340
It seems that the mermaid you were luring to the base is on a pirate ship right now.

435
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,740
Huh? Camie is on a pirate ship?!

436
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,040
I'm sick of waiting... I really was sick of waiting!

437
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,720
That pirate ship is the one I've been waiting for!

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,880
I'll kill him!

439
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,020
That man who screwed up my life!
