Share the music, even if it's far.

Share the one dream, by telling each other.

Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

Ever since then, Monkey D. Luffy...

23
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,790
I've wanted to meet you someday.

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,550
Shanks...!

25
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,510
If Shanks hadn't told me all those things about you, I wouldn't have told you any of this either.

26
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,610
Anyway, you did well to make it this far.

27
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,370
He must be awaiting your arrival in the New World.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,250
Really?

29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,150
Yeah, he must be!

30
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,430
I wanna see him again, too!

31
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,270
Well, the situation is like this, so...

32
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,790
I was supposed to coat your ship, right?

33
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,440
Come to think of it, ship-coating costs a lot of money...

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,070
No, it's fine, Hachi.

35
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,470
I won't take any money from your friends.

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,650
That's good.

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,090
Thank you, Rayleigh.

38
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,760
I don't really get it, but it's great that he'll do it for free!

39
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,500
Thanks for that!

40
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,150
You're really generous!

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Rayleigh-san...

42
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,730
Hmm?

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,910
I have a question.

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,650
Exactly what is the "Will of D"?

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,370
On the Poneglyph I saw on Sky Island...

46
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,570
Roger's name was engraved with the ancient language.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,150
How did he know those letters?

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,910
I have come here, and I will lead these words to the end.

49
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,380
Pirate Gol D. Roger.

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,330
Do you people know what happened during the "void century" 900 years ago?

51
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,950
Yeah, we know.

52
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,150
We learned the entire history.

53
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,230
However, miss...

54
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,210
Don't be hasty.

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,390
Please push forward with your ship, one step at a time.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,370
Perhaps we, as well as Ohara, were too impatient.

57
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,130
If I were to tell you the entire history here and now...

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,280
it's not like you could do anything the way you are now.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
After you've taken your time to see the world...

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,360
The conclusion you'll reach might be different from what we found.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,400
If you still want to hear it, then I'll tell you everything about the world now.

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,830
No, don't tell me.

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,070
I'll continue on the journey.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,540
You'll see it all eventually.

65
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,510
It's too bad about what happened to your homeland, Ohara.

66
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,350
But Roger couldn't actually read those letters.

67
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,510
We were pirates.

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,590
We couldn't possibly compare to the genius Clover, or the other Oharans' intelligence.

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,190
He...

70
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,130
Could hear the "voice of all things".

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,030
That's all there is.

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,210
Hey, are you sure, Robin?

73
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,170
Didn't you just let a great chance slip away?!

74
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,270
Hey, old man!

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,130
I wanna ask something too!

76
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,610
The legendary treasure, One Piece...

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,530
Is it really...

78
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,170
Usopp!

79
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,230
I don't wanna hear where the treasure is!

80
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,560
I don't even wanna hear if there is a treasure or not!

81
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,470
I dunno anything about it, but everyone sets off to sea to find out for themselves!

82
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,170
If Pops were to tell us anything here, then I'll quit on becoming Pirate King!

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,710
If we're gonna have a boring adventure like that, then I won't do it!

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,310
Uh, I got it!

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,530
I got it!

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,590
Sorry, I just got carried away!

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,520
I don't wanna hear anything either!

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,730
Oh, yeah!

89
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,070
I've got the "I'll die if I hear anything about One Piece"-disease!

90
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,870
So don't you dare say anything, old man!

91
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,890
Can you do it?

92
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,410
The Grand Line far exceeds anything than you can imagine.

93
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,030
The enemies will be strong too.

94
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,900
Can you conquer such a terrifying sea?

95
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,490
I don't wanna conquer anything!

96
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,620
It's just that the person with the most freedom on the sea is the Pirate King!

97
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,060
I see.

98
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,030
I'm really a big fan of yours, Monkey-chan.

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,050
The ship is in Grove 41, right?

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,710
I'll be going there.

101
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,110
What about you?

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,950
The admiral is still coming to this island, you know.

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,530
We'll just cause trouble if we stay here...

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,010
So, let's go somewhere...

105
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,930
And shop!

106
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,530
Are you out of your mind?!

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,790
We're being chased, so we have to stay hidden!

108
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,950
She's right.

109
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,290
If we stay together, people will probably come after us.

110
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,550
In order to get off more smoothly, it'd be better for us to split up in town.

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,090
Then, we'll just randomly split up into groups and gather up there when he's done, right?

112
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,230
Talking about gathering up like it's a plan...

113
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,710
Whose mouth did that come from?

114
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,070
Shakki, you have that, right?

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,650
Yeah, I've got one.

116
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,490
This is a Vivrecard!

117
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,210
Oh, if you know about it, that makes things easier.

118
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,530
I'm a wanted man too...

119
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,030
So I think I'll move the ship from Grove 41 and work on it somewhere else.

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,910
The coating should take about three days.

121
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,070
It takes three whole days?

122
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,010
Your lives depend on my work, so that's the fastest I can do.

123
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,410
So, we have to survive for three days...

124
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,030
Scary!

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,850
Shall we say sunset in three days?

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,510
I'm not sure which grove I'll be in...

127
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,370
But just follow the Vivrecard, and I'll be waiting for you with the ship coated.

128
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,550
You'd better go buy whatever supplies you'll need for your underwater trip to Fishman Island.

129
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,950
Thanks a lot, Luffy-chin and everyone!

130
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,970
Really, thanks!

131
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,870
This all happened because of me, so sorry!

132
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,110
To show our gratitude, we'll show you the way to Fishman Island, so don't worry!

133
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,610
Watch out for the navy for the next three days!

134
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,890
Hachi, watch your health.

135
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,670
Let's meet again in three days.

136
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,730
I'll be there to send you off, okay?

137
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,510
See ya later, granny!

138
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,830
We're up against an admiral!

139
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,890
We'll have to make sure that none of us die, eh?

140
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,610
Don't say scary stuff like that!

141
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,610
Three days, huh?

142
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,110
Then, let's go...

143
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,250
To the amusement park!

144
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,930
Hey!

145
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,670
Take care!

146
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,310
Don't be too reckless!

147
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,450
Yeah, you too!

148
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,430
I'll leave Hachi to you!

149
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,530
I guess I should go, then.

150
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,530
Yeah, I'm counting on you!

151
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,930
But who'd have thought...

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,850
that we'd meet one of the Pirate King's crew mate in a place like this?

153
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,430
It surprised me.

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,850
How should I put it... He really left an impression, especially for a geezer.

155
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,750
Well, he is the most famous of Roger's crewmates, after all.

156
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,150
So he was a crew mate on the Oro Jackson, huh?

157
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,960
I did assist a man named Roger...

158
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,990
I'm glad I met him.

159
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,850
So, you're the type of guy who respects his elders?

160
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,750
It happens from time to time!

161
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,790
Hey...

162
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,770
Why don't we go to the amusement park?

163
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,470
Will you shut up?!

164
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,290
I want to go...

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,260
You, too?!

166
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,340
Sabaody Archipelago


















Grove 27 Harbor

167
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,280
It's Admiral Kizaru!

168
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,360
We've got to run!

169
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Capture the pirates!

170
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
Hello?

171
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,780
There are plenty of wanted pirates around!

172
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,740
Look out for those with bounties exceeding 100 million!

173
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,300
Run!

174
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,180
Hello? This is Kizaru...

175
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,660
Now, that's odd...

"Kizaru" (Borsalino)

177
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,720
{\an8}Hello?

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,160
How strange...

179
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,640
This is really bad!

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
If I...

181
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,640
If I were to take him down, I'd become famous at once!

182
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,210
Don't be a fool! He's one of the navy's strongest fighters!

183
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,500
Now! You...

184
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,900
Stop it!

185
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,580
Hello?

186
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,660
What?! Hey, I'm sure I just hit him!

187
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,060
It definitely passed through his head!

188
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,880
Now, that's really odd...

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,400
It's obvious that he's got some sort of ability!

190
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,080
There's no way a gun would work!

191
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,050
Run!

192
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,500
I'd like to ask you a question...

193
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,090
I'm looking for a man named Sentoumaru...

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,190
That guy's my subordinate, you see...

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Sheesh, I was just asking...

196
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,020
Don't you think that's going too far, Kizaru-san?

197
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
You can't destroy the Yarukiman Mangroves!

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Oops, seems like I overdid it...

199
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,160
He's totally messed up...

200
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,980
So, that's Admiral Kizaru?

201
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,000
Apoo-san! We're in trouble, too!

202
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,700
We have to get away!

203
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,540
You're such an idiot.

204
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Where's the fun in just running away?

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,460
We've gotta upset the enemy before we go.

206
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,920
What are you planning to do?!

207
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,910
Requesting backup at the port!

208
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,000
What happened?

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,380
I don't know!

210
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,900
I have no idea, but all our troops...

211
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,520
have turned into children and old men!

212
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,340
What's going on?!

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,010
My back is killing me...

214
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,020
This is classic!

215
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,800
It's her doing!

216
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,760
The one with the bounty of 140 million: Jewelry Bonney!

217
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,140
Watch out for the rookies with bounties over 100 million!

218
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,080
You dog!

219
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,180
You're Capone "Gang" Bege, the guy with 138 million on your head, right?!

220
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,200
You'll never reach the sea!

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,020
What happened to your subordinates?! Are they moving independently?!

222
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,580
What an unlucky man you are... Surrender!

223
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,800
I've got you guys beaten...

224
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,480
when it comes to military might.

225
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Oh, I'd like to ask you something...

226
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
K-Kizaru!

227
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
W-We'll take care of this...

228
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,940
Captain, please run away!

229
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,810
Do not panic.

230
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,790
I will not die today.

231
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,300
I'm telling you, we'll hide in the amusement park!

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,480
Stop lying.

233
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,700
You'd just play around, flashily at that.

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,310
Who're you?

235
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
We're under attack!

236
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,580
Don't just stand around!

237
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
Standby to attack!

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,220
Bring out the cannons!

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,020
Open the gates!

240
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,640
Commence attack!

241
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,460
What?!

242
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,740
Shoot!

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,620
What?

244
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
This guy's got something inside his body!

245
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,220
It got bigger...!

246
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,420
What's going on?!

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,560
He didn't even do anything!

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,000
Cavalry, charge!

249
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,620
Something's coming out of his stomach again!

250
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,060
An army is coming out!

251
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,620
Now it's horses?!

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,620
Capone "Gang" Bege...

253
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,100
What kind of power does he have?!

254
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,460
Firing squad, take aim!

255
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,180
What's with the smoke?

256
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,780
Father, there's too much smoke!

257
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,760
Like I said, I've got you outnumbered!

258
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Sabaody Archipelago


















Grove 27 Harbor

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,260
Hurry up and run!

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,620
It seems that the Seven Warlords are on the move!

261
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
Seriously? Who?

262
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
The Seven Warlords?!

263
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,350
Grove 24

264
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,820
I suppose they won't let us pass Navy HQ...

265
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,760
But!

266
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,480
I've got a bit of a stubborn streak!

267
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,480
Island Grove 24

268
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,220
I'm begging you. Run, Captain Hawkins!

269
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
Captain Hawkins!

270
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,730
Battle: Probability of defeat, 100%...

271
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,730
Do you have a moment?

272
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,920
Escape: Probability of success, 12%...

273
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm trying to find a man named Sentoumaru...

274
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,960
Defense: Probability of evasion, 76%...

275
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,700
I do not know that man.

276
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,880
Please ask someone else.

277
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,740
Well, if I can't find him...

278
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,620
I won't have anything to do...

279
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,790
And with that being the case, there's no way I'd let someone with a bounty like yours, go free.

280
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,480
A bounty of 249 million, "The Mage", Basil Hawkins...

281
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,480
Speed is weight.

282
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,360
Have you ever experienced a light-speed kick?

283
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,780
Captain!

284
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,480
Grove 27

285
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,030
What happened?!

286
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,260
Hey, what happened?!

287
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,640
I don't know! He just suddenly flew off!

288
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,670
Grove 24

289
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,000
He's really strong.

290
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
Hey, is he still gonna fight?!

291
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,190
Archipelago Harbor

292
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,260
Hey, what was that?

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
He just suddenly...

294
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
He must have been attacked from somewhere...

295
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Grove 24

296
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,180
Captain!

297
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,000
I should have guessed, you are far stronger than I imagined.

298
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,020
How odd...

299
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,220
You've beaten two already...

300
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,580
Having only ten bodies against an admiral is pretty discouraging...

301
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,560
That's the "Mad Monk", Urouge!

302
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,680
Not just him!

303
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,380
That's one of the Seven Warlords, Bartholomew Kuma!

304
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,700
He got me... He's too strong!

305
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,180
Don't tell me... that's Kizaru?!

306
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,580
I've got terrible luck!

307
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,920
A navy admiral in front of me...

308
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,860
A Warlord behind me...

309
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,480
Is this the end for me?!

310
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
I wouldn't say that.

311
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,920
I still do not see the mark of death upon you.

312
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,880
Really?

313
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,540
Hawkins from North Blue, huh?

314
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,940
You may be my enemy, but I appreciate the joke!

315
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,280
What? Another one showed up!

316
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,460
That's "Red Flag", X-Drake!

317
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,300
Why?!

318
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,260
Rear admiral, Drake...

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,280
Damn, I didn't intend to meet Kizaru!

320
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm pretty badly beaten, but let's see...

321
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,500
if there really is some hope of victory!

322
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,670
Now, it's time for my counterattack!

323
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,760
Look! This has become quite the situation.

324
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,520
Now, this is interesting!

325
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,060
We're in trouble!

326
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,960
Those guys are all gonna die!

327
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,280
This is our chance to run, right?!

328
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,880
What're you saying?

329
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,970
This is where the fun begins!

330
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,170
Grove 12

331
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Who're you?

332
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,640
Stand back, Luffy!

333
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,820
He's one of the Seven Warlords!

334
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,980
Seven Warlords?

335
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,820
How do you know?

336
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,380
No matter what, don't let that attack hit you!

337
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,490
It's a shockwave!

338
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,220
What's this?!

339
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,550
He could even do this?!

340
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,320
Hey, that's not a shockwave!

341
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,430
That's a...

342
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,960
Beam!

343
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,140
This is no time to be happy!

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,820
Bartholomew Kuma... Why is he here again?!

345
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,650
That bastard...!

346
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,920
Is he that guy who showed up afterwards on Thriller Bark?!

347
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
Yeah, that's him!

348
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,860
Back then, he made some shockwave from the pads on his hand and caused us a lot of trouble!

349
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,740
He was planning to eliminate us there, but...

350
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,140
I guess he realized we survived and came back!

351
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,280
Back then, you sure got us good!

352
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,110
Coup de Vent

353
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
It worked!

354
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,620
No.

355
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,180
Luffy-san!

356
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,900
Gear Second

357
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,300
I already know you're strong, so I'll go all-out right away!

358
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,240
We've got no choice!

359
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,740
Something's strange...

360
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,480
He feels different from back then...

361
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
Is it just my imagination?

362
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,620
Let's go!

363
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:51,720
Grove 36

364
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,520
He's late!

365
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,460
The warships should be here by now...

366
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,660
That's strange...

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,200
Why hasn't he contacted me yet, that old man Kizaru...

368
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,710
If he doesn't hurry up...

369
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,280
I'll have to...

370
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,960
finish off all those rookies!
