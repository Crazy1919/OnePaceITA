I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,460
An Island in Chaos

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,030
Sorry guys.

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,790
Punching this guy means a navy admiral
is gonna come here with a warship...

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,430
I missed my chance to cut him down
because you beat him up first.

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
Hachi! Hang on!

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,100
You're all in big trouble now...!

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,200
We can't help it! That's just how Luffy is!

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,860
Alright then...

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,330
Guess that makes it clear
what we gotta do now.

29
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,820
I think the key to Camie's collar
is probably somewhere backstage!

30
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,110
I need to tend to Hachi's
injury! You get the key!

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,050
Guys...!

32
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,190
Charloss...!

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,530
Brother Charloss! Not even
Father has ever struck you!

34
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,800
Curse you!

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,950
How dare you a commoner
lay a hand on my son!

36
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,110
Th-They've made the Celestial Dragons mad!

37
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,010
Run! Get outside!

38
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,660
I'll teach you what happens
when you assault us

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,110
the descendants of this world's Creators!

40
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,770
Hell if we care you bastard!

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,190
How dare you strike Saint Roswald!

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,530
Joue!

43
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,530
Concasser!

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,260
Go Franky! Free Camie-chan!

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,370
Alright! Super leave it to me!

46
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,010
Guards! Get them! Seize the pirates!

47
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,670
They just keep coming!

48
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,150
Only a fool would protect a lousy fish!

49
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,750
You intend to defy us to
the very end do you?!

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,040
Camie isn't for sale!

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,270
Call for a navy admiral and a warship!

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,700
Let them see who's boss!

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,030
A pirate struck a Celestial Dragon!

54
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,400
Navy Headquarters is going
to send a warship now!

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,040
Duck!

56
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,350
36 Pound Cannon!

57
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,230
Are you trying to kill us?!

58
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,880
Camie!

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,100
Hatchin!

60
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,560
Are you okay?! They didn't do
anything bad to you did they?!

61
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,410
I'm fine! But you've been hurt!

62
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,140
Don't worry! Who do you take me for?!

63
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,210
I'm Hachi the takoyaki seller!

64
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,190
Just hang on a little
longer! Wait right there!

65
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah! Hatchin! Everyone!

66
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,730
An uproar is already underway. There's
a flood of people at the entrance.

67
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,570
Our only choice is to jump into the
fray! Just crash into it if you would!

68
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,760
Understood!

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,690
Huh?! I-I need to prepare myself first!

70
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,290
Here we go!

71
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,620
My "can't go to auction houses" disease...!

72
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,420
More flying fish!

73
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,680
Thank you!

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,500
Take care!

75
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,460
Cien Fleurs!

76
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,930
Wing!

77
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,170
Alright! Good luck!

78
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,140
Off I go!

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,300
Clutch!

80
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,660
Now then! Pardon my late entrance!

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,980
Damn! Guard the mermaid at all costs!

82
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,310
500 million! She sold for 500 million!

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,770
Since I'm here maybe I'll
just fret for a little longer!

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,860
Get going already!

85
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,080
I actually would've preferred
to do it at my own pace!

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,890
I'll punish these cretins by
stuffing and preserving the women

87
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,290
and making the men slaves and starving them!

88
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,960
Father!

89
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,310
Oww oww...!

90
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,380
Wait that didn't hurt that much...

91
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Sorry mister!

92
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,210
S-Saint Roswald too?!

93
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,140
You just repeated your crime pirate!

94
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,440
Usopp! Robin! Brook!

95
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,110
Looks like everyone's here!

96
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,920
Luffy! Where's Camie?!

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,650
Over there! We'll run away as soon
as the bomb around her neck is off!

98
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,240
We have to hurry before the
warship and admiral get here!

99
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,580
Eh?!

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,000
The navy's already here Straw Hat-ya.

101
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,170
Who're you?

102
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,120
What's with that bear?

103
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,010
They've had the place surrounded
before the auctions even began.

104
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,350
Navy Headquarters has a post
on this archipelago you see.

105
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,440
Please leave the area immediately!
It's all right! We're here!

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,570
How's it look inside?!

107
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,750
We've finished evacuating the patrons!

108
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,890
The three Celestial Dragons are still inside!

109
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,530
Bring them out at once!

110
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,490
You damn pirates! Don't think
you'll get out of here unhurt!

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,290
I dunno who they wanted to catch

112
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,260
but I doubt they expected anyone
would beat up the Celestial Dragons.

113
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,260
That was an interesting show
you gave Straw Hat-ya crew.

114
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,830
You must be Trafalgar Law.

115
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,390
Luffy. He's a pirate.

116
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,650
Huh?! The bear too?

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,910
The 500 million Berries!

118
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,110
P-P-Please wait Saint Shalria!

119
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,490
That item hasn't been paid for yet!

120
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,740
Please wait Saint Shalria! Saint Shalria!

121
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,680
Quiet commoner!

122
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
Crap! Camie-chan's in trouble!

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,020
Quit your squirming!

124
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,210
Damn...!

125
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
S-Saint Shalria!

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,030
See Mr. Giant?

127
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,400
The place is in a real uproar.
I'd say the auction's over.

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,250
I've stolen some money now

129
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,470
so guess I'll head back
to the gambling houses...

130
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,640
You're one disagreeable old man.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,100
You were only here to get some money?

132
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,990
I was hoping for a chance to steal
from whoever bought me too...

133
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,730
But I guess it wasn't meant to be.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,660
Oh right. I'm all out.
First thing is more alcohol.

135
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,530
Think about it.

136
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,910
I don't know about you but I wouldn't
want an old man like me for a slave.

137
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,630
Oh? Looks like we've
garnered some attention...

138
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,250
Who's that old man and that giant?!

139
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,030
Those are today's merchandise! How
did they get out of their cell?!

140
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,520
They don't have collars!
How did they unlock them?!

141
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,450
What do we do?

142
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,110
What do you mean? Catching people is
outside of our field of expertise!

143
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,240
We can't hold back an unshackled giant!

144
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,270
R-Rayleigh!

145
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,460
You mean Rayleigh the coating craftsman?!

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,700
Which one is he?!

147
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,850
Oh! Is that you Hachi?! It is!

148
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,190
It's good to see you again!
What are you doing here?!

149
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
How did you get that injury?!

150
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,110
No that's okay you needn't say a thing!

151
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,020
In short... I see. I understand
the situation now.

152
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,480
You sure got yourself into
a heap of trouble Hachi.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,370
And you folks saved him?

154
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,130
Well then...

155
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,060
Is he...

156
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,980
It couldn't be!

157
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,190
Huh?! How?! What did you just do?!

158
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,360
Who is this old guy?!

159
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,170
That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.

160
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,880
I've been wanting to meet you...

161
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,620
...Monkey D. Luffy.

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,670
Sabaody Archipelago Lawless Zone

163
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,670
This is bad! This town-- this
whole archipelago-- is in danger!

164
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,260
Straw Hat Luffy supposedly kicked
a Celestial Dragon's ass!

165
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,640
At the auction house on Grove #1!

166
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,790
What?!

167
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,960
Apparently Kid and Law are there too!

168
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,270
That Straw Hat bastard!
What was he thinking?!

169
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,140
Doesn't he know that an admiral
from Navy Headquarters

170
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,160
will bring a warship here if
anyone hurts a Celestial Dragon?!

171
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,610
Has our ship been coated?!

172
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,470
It was completed yesterday!

173
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,570
We set sail for Fish-Man Island immediately!

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,010
We can't just sit around
while an admiral shows up!

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,140
There's no point in staying here!

176
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,570
Yes sir!

177
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,690
Guess that dumbass's captain
is an even bigger dumbass!

178
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,440
If I ever run into 'em in the
New World... I'll destroy 'em!

179
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,440
If I ever run into 'em in the
New World... I'll destroy 'em!

180
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,530
Causing trouble with Navy Headquarters
with the New World right in sight...

181
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,540
What a truly troublesome lot they are...

182
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,410
Focus on getting ready to set sail.

183
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,540
Yes sir! Right away Captain Drake!

184
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,190
Now then. Who's going to show up?

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,150
Given the situation I somehow doubt
this is an all-out arrest plot.

186
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,480
It's Straw Hat Luffy they're after right?

187
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,790
I think I'd like to see what
an admiral is actually like.

188
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,400
You can't be serious Apoo-san!
Let's just get out of here!

189
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,990
Captain Hawkins! It's dangerous
here! Let's set sail immediately!

190
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,540
Calm down.

191
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,920
I am not destined to die today.

192
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,230
"Holy Land of Marie Jois"

193
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,550
That brat again?! It's one
thing after the other!

194
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,050
What's with that entire family's bloodline?!

195
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,050
Reports indicate the presence
of the Straw Hat crew

196
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,700
Eustass Captain Kid and his crew
and Trafalgar Law and his crew.

197
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,240
Thirteen people with bounties
have been confirmed!

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,850
Of them five are rookies
worth over 100 million each!

199
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,720
Naturally the key offender
appears to be Monkey D. Luffy

200
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,860
who assaulted the Celestial Dragons!

201
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,990
We've lost contact with the
guards at the Human Shop--

202
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,930
oh I mean Employment Office.

203
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,130
I believe they may have all been subdued...

204
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,080
In any case this act of taking
three Celestial Dragons hostage

205
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,220
is a vile and unprecedented transgression!

206
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,180
Have they made any demands?

207
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,920
No none at the moment...

208
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,600
Whatever the case may be Sengoku-san
we'll need to take action

209
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,890
given that World Nobles are the victims here.

210
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,980
Kizaru...

211
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:47,010
Allow me to go. Rest easy; I won't be long.

212
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,260
"Justice"

213
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,310
Sabaody Archipelago
Grove 1
Human Auction Shop
Backstage

214
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,620
This is no laughing matter!

215
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,220
This is your shop you know!

216
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,120
Mister Doflamingo...!
Where are you right now?!

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,230
The shop has lost all credibility and
then there's Roswald's family too!

218
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,840
They're definitely going to lash out at us!

219
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,750
Do something to fix things!

220
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,370
Seriously... Human trafficking
is so old-fashioned you idiot.

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,540
It's all about smiles now! Smiles!

222
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,160
Disco I'm giving the shop to you.

223
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,210
So don't be callin' me anymore!

224
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,180
What?! You're abandoning us during
the worst crisis we've ever had?!

225
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,310
Quiet you annoying bastard!

226
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,910
While you sit there blaming
me for your own misfortune

227
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,350
a "New Era" draws ever closer Disco-kun.

228
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,680
The navy has given orders forcing
me-- no us-- into active duty!

229
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,200
Knowing this what do you see
on the horizon Disco-kun?

230
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,460
The Whitebeard Pirates versus
the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

231
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,900
Grove 1
In Front of the Auction House

232
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,980
Please evacuate as far away as you can!

233
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,980
No watching please! These
are dangerous people!

234
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,720
The slave I bought is still inside!

235
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,560
Have the mortars arrived yet?

236
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,490
Yes most of them! We're
hurrying to set them up!

237
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,430
Has HQ said anything?

238
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,950
That Admiral Kizaru is coming but
the vanguard will consist of...

239
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,410
Of them?! They're coming here?!

240
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,670
Yes sir! That's what they said...

241
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,890
Hold on old man! Don't
be crazy! It'll explode!

242
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,390
We've seen a slave's collar explode before!

243
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,150
That's a bad idea! A very bad idea!

244
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,810
It'll be all right. Just stay still.

245
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,410
I dunno what kind of power he used...

246
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,280
What's Franky doing?!

247
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,740
I'm telling you it's too dangerous!
It won't come off without the key!

248
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,500
It's ringing! What're we gonna do?!

249
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,090
Camie!

250
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,150
What's all this now?!
Don't scare me like that!

251
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,190
Your collar and handcuffs are already off!

252
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
It came off...

253
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,070
C-Camie!

254
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,070
Camie! Thank goodness!

255
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,090
What the hell?! I finally manage
to find 'em but then...!

256
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,950
Oh! You found them? Well done!

257
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,960
But we no longer need them.
Here you carry this girl.

258
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,670
U-Umm... Th-Thanks!

259
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,520
What in the hell's going on
here?! Who are you anyway?!

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,330
Huh? What did he do?

261
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,450
That geezer did something mysterious again!

262
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,120
Just who is that old guy?!

263
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,270
Hey almost-slaves!

264
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,540
All the buyers took off! You
should scram while you can too!

265
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,260
Here!

266
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,430
If that geezer took out these
guards all at once too

267
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,230
then he must know how to use
magic or some type of sorcery!

268
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,740
He's got powers or something!

269
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,550
He said something about
your straw hat though...

270
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,480
That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.

271
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,020
I've been wanting to meet you...

272
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,940
...Monkey D. Luffy.

273
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,770
How do you know him Luffy?!

274
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,920
I don't know him! Really!

275
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,240
I think he used what's called "Haki."

276
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,880
I don't know much about it either though...

277
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,330
Sorry about that fellows. I didn't
realize other pirates were watching.

278
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,630
You must be quite strong to have
withstood that with no problem at all.

279
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,260
I never expected to meet
such a big-shot here...

280
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,220
"Dark King" Silvers Rayleigh...

281
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,090
No doubt about it. What's a legendary
man doing in a place like this?

282
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,220
On these islands I'm Ray-san
the coating craftsman.

283
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,550
Don't go calling me that other name.

284
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,220
I'm an old soldier now. I just
want to live in peace and quiet.

285
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,520
I take it you'll survive Hachi?

286
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,120
After I told you all those times
not to walk around these islands...

287
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,990
I'm sorry...

288
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,510
Thanks for saving my friend fellows.

289
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,330
So what's this about wanting
to meet me old guy?

290
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,170
Yes let's save that for later.
We first need to get out of here.

291
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,210
They have the place completely
surrounded Boss.

292
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,050
Alright you criminals! Release
the Roswald family at once!

293
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,720
An admiral will be arriving shortly!
I recommend immediate surrender!

294
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,780
Don't blame us for whatever
happens you rookies!

295
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,360
We're not only caught up in this we're
being treated as accomplices now.

296
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,350
I got a good glimpse of the insanity
that makes Straw Hat Luffy so notorious.

297
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,870
I have no complaints but I'd rather not
run into an admiral now if I can avoid it!

298
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,290
Oh I'd prefer not to use that power of
mine anymore so I leave this to you!

299
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,590
It'll be hard for me to stay settled
down if the navy discovers who I am.

300
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,550
I have no intention of helping
out a senior citizen!

301
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,060
The longer we stay here the
more troops there'll be!

302
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,430
I think I'll go on ahead!

303
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,410
While I'm at it I'll help you guys out too!

304
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,270
I'll clean things up outside so don't worry!

305
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,500
I told you I'll do it!

306
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,570
Shut up!

307
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,100
I'm gonna do it!

308
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,190
Get outta here!

309
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,240
Shut up you guys!

310
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,610
I'm going to do it.

311
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,280
What're you talking about?!

312
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
I told you leave it to me!

313
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,100
No! I'm gonna do it!

314
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,270
Don't tell me what to do!

315
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,760
You guys just don't get it!

316
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,230
You're the one who doesn't get it!

317
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,410
Alright!

318
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,700
You guys can go back inside!

319
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,500
Hey! Are you even listening?!
I told you two to stay back!

320
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,760
Tell me what to do again and I'll start
by getting rid of you Eustass-ya!

321
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,940
Get ready!

322
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,210
Geez they're so simpleminded!

323
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,350
Hey! There's gonna an all-out brawl!

324
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,110
Let's use that chance to escape! We
can't just sit around here anyway!

325
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,030
Hatchin...

326
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,320
Thanks... I'm sorry for
causing you trouble...!

327
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,200
Never mind me! I'm just
glad you're all right!

328
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,540
Let's follow them. We're going
to break through in one go.

329
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,410
All right then.

330
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,880
Let us meet up on Grove #13 should
we find ourselves separated.

331
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,310
Grove #13? Got it!

332
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,730
You don't "got it" at all!

333
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,750
What will you do Mr. Giant?!

334
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,340
We were all on the verge of becoming slaves.

335
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,470
I'm going to flee somewhere
with these people!

336
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,130
I see! Be careful not to
draw attention to yourself!

337
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,160
Old man! Straw Hat's friends!

338
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,020
I will repay this favor if we
ever meet again! Thank you!

339
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,040
Thanks so much!

340
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,540
Thank you!

341
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,100
Sure no problem!

342
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,820
You're taking credit?!

343
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,980
Mortars! Fire!

344
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,660
Gum-Gum...

345
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,490
...Balloon!

346
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,790
Repel!

347
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,460
