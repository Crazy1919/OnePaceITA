I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

Navy HQ

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,200
The Dark King, Silvers Rayleigh, huh?

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,720
It would appear the others haven't noticed, and think he's just a normal old guy.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,700
They're gonna sell the Dark King in the Human Auction, huh?

{\an5}The Auction House Incident

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,080
If he's the real deal, then this is a really bad situation...

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,060
Although my subordinates can't be 100% sure...

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,640
Tea!

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,580
Uh, right.

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,700
What should we do, vice-admiral? Should I report this to Fleet Admiral Sengoku?

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,640
Nah, I'll handle this myself. Don't tell anyone else, not even Sengoku!

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,200
Make sure to tell your subordinates!

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,780
But if it really is him...

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,600
It's him. No doubt about that.

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I hear some reports about the guy from time to time.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,200
I'd say he's probably ended up losing his freedom in a gamble.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,680
He might be an old man, but if we try to take on Rayleigh unprepared,

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,820
I'd say we'd probably lose countless soldiers in the attempt.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,460
It's especially dangerous right now.

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,180
You think the Navy can handle two legends at the same time?!

Grove 1



















Human Auction Site

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,640
Well then, everyone! Thank you for your patience!

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,900
In a moment, the 1st grove's monthly tradition...

43
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,900
the Great Human Auction, shall commence!

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,250
Our host, of course, is this man!

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
The walking super bazaar...

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,760
Mr. Disco!

47
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,380
Good day, everyone! This time, we've got quite an excellent selection of slaves for you!

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
You are all lucky! We've got a spectacular deluxe item for later in the show!

49
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,680
The only thing on my mind is making sure everyone here leaves with the slave they've been waiting for!

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,900
Well, then, let us start the auction!

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,240
Prepare numbers 2 and 3.

52
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,040
Understood!

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,140
Entry #1: from Toroa in West Blue!

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,520
A master of instruments from a musician family!

55
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,380
A pirate standing proud and tall!

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,540
With his instrument, he'll play any music you want,

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,460
a human music box!

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,880
Give him a mop, and he will clean up any filth perfectly!

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
He is also a fantastic wine maker!

60
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,560
A 25 year old human male, a perfect working age!

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,580
192 cm, 130 kg, name: Byron!

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,340
We will start off the bidding with the special starting price of 480 thousand belly!

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
Well, then, raise your plate if you wish to place a bid!

64
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,060
Number 82 makes a bid of 500 thousand belly!

65
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,560
We have 600 thousand from number 7! Anyone else?!

66
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,120
Sold, for 600 thousand belly!

67
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,390
{\an8}Note: Human trade

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,930
What's this, Duval?

69
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,500
This disgusting list?

70
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,700
It's the market prices.

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
Market prices?

72
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,900
Basic auction minimum prices...

73
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,980
Humans, 500 thousand belly.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,360
Male giants are 50 million belly...

75
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,460
What? Female mermen are sold for 70 million belly?!

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,530
You understand why everyone tries to catch mermaids now, right?

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,130
The value is something else!

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,660
You can do whatever you want to them once you've bought them...

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,420
but they usually end up in some rich person's aquarium.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,280
They have to live out their lives as decorations in small tanks.

81
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,010
What're you trying to say, damn you?!

82
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,620
Now that I think about it though, you can hardly call that "living" at all.

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,060
If that's what you think, then hurry up and find her!

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,180
We've covered all the slave-traders stationed in the 20's!

85
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,260
Hurry up and go into the air!

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't make it sound so easy!

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,520
This ain't a bird, you know, it's gotta pick up speed first!

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,420
Camie! Where are you?!

89
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,740
This is what's getting to me!

90
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,980
Kidnapping team "Coffee Monkeys"

91
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,760
It was a giant, damn it! It was easy enough to catch the guy sleeping...

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,440
but do you have any idea how hard it was to carry'im?!

93
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,160
Of course, you'd think we'd gotten the big draw this time, right?

94
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,400
That's how it usually is, right?

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,160
But then some guy went and brought a freakin' mermaid to the auction house!

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,860
Who wouldn't get drunk when somethin' like that happens?

97
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,680
Hang on! Who was that?

98
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,140
This is unit 5, to all Rosy Life Riders!

99
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,420
Can you hear me? The guy who took the mermaid is Peterman!

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,980
The place they took her to was the auction in Grove 1!

101
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,960
Did you say it was Peterman?

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,980
Did you find it out?

103
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,340
Yeah, let's fly!

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,460
This is a little too fast! I am scared!

105
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,720
She hasn't been sold already, has she?

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,420
Hurry!

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,700
Grove 1 should be nearby! Leave it to me!

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
We'll head towards the Auction House!

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,420
You figured out where she is? Thank god!

110
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,140
Camie!

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,940
Hurry!

112
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,880
I'd like to return to the ship, but where's the number 1 tree?

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
I'll tell you!

114
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,400
Well, well, let us keep going! Here is entry #6!

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,520
A 10-pack of male human workers!

116
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,160
This is the Head, calling all men! Get me some info on today's auction!

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,820
It started at 4 o'clock, and it's been going for 30 minutes already!

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,960
Hey, will this really be alright?

119
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,460
No problem at all!

120
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,020
A mermaid would certainly be the main event, so they'll save her for the end!

121
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
We'll make it!

122
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,920
Anyway, take the fastest route! This thing is slower than the Flying Fish!

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,660
Like I said, calm down, Master Black Leg!

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,780
I'm the Head of this team! Did you see me change my course after we learned the mermaid's location?

125
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,080
Uh, no...

126
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,840
That's because...

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,880
I've been heading to Grove 1 from the beginning!

128
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,640
Look ahead! That's Grove 1! I am the Head, so I got here before everyone else!

129
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,660
Are you serious?

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,060
This must be the intuition of a professional!

131
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,440
We've arrived, Reindeer-san!

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Thank you. Huh?

133
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,080
Oh, Sanji!

134
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,640
You lost, didn't you?!

135
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,380
Be careful!

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
Yeah! Thanks a lot!

137
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,180
What's with this guy?

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,580
200 thousand belly! Anyone else?

139
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,960
Sold!

140
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,380
Is this it?

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,920
Like I said, why can't you give her back?!

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm telling you that Camie-chan is not for sale!

143
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,680
You're the one who's out of line here!

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,440
If you don't drop it soon, I can take legal countermeasures!

145
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,140
You're disturbing our business!

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,680
Those guys...!

147
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,660
What do you mean, "business", you damn bastard?!

148
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,240
Do you think I'll accept a business like this in this world?!

149
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,700
A lawless pirate like yourself has no right to lecture me about morality!

150
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,540
Slave-trading is a worldwide taboo! How much did you pay the government?

151
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,620
What an ill-mannered accusation...

152
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,560
But I suppose you're right!

153
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,240
When talking to the government or marines,

154
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,600
it seems that terms like "slave-trading" are hard for them comprehend.

155
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,840
It's as if they have no idea that this business of ours exists!

156
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,260
How ridiculous... So the whole system is crooked, then?!

157
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,220
How can the government tolerate this?!

158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,780
So, could you please...

159
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,120
This is annoying!

160
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,100
We're sure the mermaid is in there, so let's just break her out!

161
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Weapons...

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,260
No! There are Celestial Dragons inside!

163
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,940
And if Camie has been brought here, then she's probably got a neck ring already!

164
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,840
That exploding thing?!

165
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,960
Then, we can't just get her out?

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,040
If you'd please leave then.

167
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,700
Why, you...!

168
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,200
No, Sanji!

169
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,520
Let me go, Chopper!

170
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,860
I can't, Sanji!

171
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,920
Damn it...

172
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
If the guy won't listen, then...!

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Hey, Girlie! Where are you going?

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
I said calm down, Sanji!

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,460
If we can't hurt them, then we'll just play by their rules to get Camie back!

176
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,400
Backstage

177
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,800
Bring out numbers 15 and 16.

178
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,680
Understood.

179
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,040
Please stop!

180
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,880
I don't want to! I'd rather stay in the cell!

181
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,100
I don't wanna be a slave!

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,940
Help me, please! Help!

183
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
Give him a tranquilizer.

184
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,360
Call the Navy! Please!

185
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,980
Don't sell me, please!

186
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,960
Hacchin... Save me!

187
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,800
Noooooo!

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,360
Chief, I think that's the Straw Hat crew.

189
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,860
The Straw Hats' captain isn't there...

190
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,960
I was hoping to see just how dumb he was myself...

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,720
Now, things are heating up, on this Grand Human Auction!

192
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,940
Our next entry is an instant purchase, for sure!

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,640
Entry number 15 is a knockout female slave!

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,240
Please observe the miraculous proportions of this 20 year old dancer, Pascia!

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,140
She's one of today's big draws!

196
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,700
Her marvelous dancing figure is sure to impress even the heavens!

197
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,620
We've got loads of treasure stored on the ship.

198
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,440
It's at least 200 million in all...

199
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
What's the going price for a mermaid?

200
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,820
If you have that much, then it should be enough, but I can't repay that!

201
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,760
What, Hachi? Are you Camie's guardian or something?

202
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,280
It's not like that...

203
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,380
If it's to get our friend back, then I don't care how much we have to pay!

204
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,700
Everyone agrees, right?

205
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,460
Of course! This isn't about money!

206
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,540
Thanks a lot... you guys...

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,660
I'll never forget this...!

208
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,140
That's the Nami-san I love!

209
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,660
Shut up and come on.

210
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,460
Hurry! Hurry!

211
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,840
I get it!

212
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,780
Hurry to Grove 1!

213
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,040
So this is Grove 2, huh?

214
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,000
Then it's the next one, right?

215
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,640
Is everyone there yet?

216
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,620
Extra! Extra!

217
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,740
Is the World Government out of its mind?

218
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,280
If they really do this, then...!

219
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,280
Captain, this could mean trouble!

220
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
Is that how it is?

221
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Is something wrong, Captain Drake?

222
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,340
I understand now...

223
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,720
Seeing how close this island is to Navy HQ...

224
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,280
I thought it was strange that there were so few marines around.

225
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,680
What has happened?

226
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,200
It's been decided that Fire Fist Ace, commander of Whitebeard's second division, is set to be executed!

227
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,340
If they do that, then Whitebeard is sure to make a move!

228
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,880
There's gonna be a war!

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Entry #15!

230
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,660
The beautiful dancer, Pascia!

231
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,060
With a splendid starting bid of 800 thousand belly,

232
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,800
the bid has risen to an amazing 7 million 200 thousand belly!

233
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,520
Ah... We have finally arrived.

234
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,780
Well well, things are heating up now...

235
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,740
What will be the next item up for bid?!

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,080
Good, the auction is still going.

237
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,480
However they're almost done.

238
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
This one is truly useless!

239
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,560
Hey! Have this one sold off too! I don't want him anymore.

240
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
I'll do the paperwork right away.

241
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,640
A Celestial Dragon...

242
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,660
Another one showed up... One of the World Nobles...

243
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,860
Those guys that can call an admiral from the Navy if we attack them, huh?

244
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,580
I would like a mermaid... Are they gonna sell one today?

245
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,040
It seems that mermaids are quite difficult to catch...

246
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,280
so I doubt they've got one this time.

247
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,660
Oh, my! Saint Charlos!

248
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,080
Hurry and take me to my seat!

249
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,260
Yes, right away, Sir!

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,640
So, you are finally here, big brother Charlos?

251
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,840
Well then, it seems we're ready...

252
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,440
Entry #16 is...

253
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,080
Can you believe it?! A pirate captain!

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,740
A wanted man with a bounty of 17 million belly! His name is Lacuba!

255
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,480
He is a pirate famous for his delicate, intricate planning! His well built body is also worthy of note.

256
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,020
He'd make an excellent transport, hard worker, or sandbag!

257
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,880
A practical choice if I ever saw one!

258
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,580
Now then...!

259
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
Don't tell me, he...?!

260
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,360
He collapsed! What's going on?!

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,580
I saw blood!

262
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,720
Hey! Hurry up and pull the curtains!

263
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,880
What just happened?

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
He bit his tongue.

265
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,420
He decided that he didn't want to live his life as a slave...

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,380
and figured it would be better to just die right now.

267
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,380
I suppose that's actually a logical choice.

268
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,480
Aren't they going to bring out the mermaid soon?

269
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm sure Camie is really scared...

270
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Just hang in there a little longer...

271
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,100
We're going to save you!

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,980
Fortunately, we have the treasure from Thriller Bark!

273
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,660
Thanks a lot, you guys...

274
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,220
This is no good...

275
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,220
God damn it! We can't sell him now... That idiot!

276
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
The mermaid is up next, right?

277
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Yes. We're ready to get her whenever you want us to.

278
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,120
Alright!

279
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,760
Get her out, now!

280
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,360
Yes!

281
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,700
Well then, about #16!

282
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,660
It would appear that the pirate Lacuba got a little nervous... He had a nosebleed, and collapsed.

283
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,040
We'll put him up for sale again later.

284
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,120
However, everyone...!

285
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,440
The next item we're going to bring out now...

286
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,180
is a super deluxe-item that's sure to make you forget all about this trouble!

287
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,920
Countless people have tried to capture one...

288
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,160
Please look at this silhouette!

289
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,900
Could it be...?!

290
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,260
An introduction should not be necessary... Just have a look with your own eyes!

291
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,620
Thank you for your patience! Well then, here it comes!

292
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,380
Have a good look at this!

293
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,320
Straight from Fishman Island...

294
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,840
Camie, the mermaid!!!

295
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,340
It's real! A young mermaid!

296
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,000
Hacchin and the others! They're here to save me!

297
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,660
Camie! They've brought out Camie!

298
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,300
Alright, we're gonna take her back!

299
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,720
We've got 200 million after all!

300
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,180
Camie!

301
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,560
Finally! A mermaid! They're selling a mermaid!

302
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,820
Five hundred million!!

303
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll buy it for 500 million belly!

304
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,860
No use... We can't beat that...

305
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,320
What's that? We don't have that much!

306
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,340
You've gone and wasted our money again.

307
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,880
You already have piranhas in your fish tank, do you not?

308
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,800
I'd like too see them try and chase after her...

309
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Mermaids are the fastest sea-creatures in the world.

310
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,920
I can't hear the voices outside...

311
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,040
Get me out of here, Hacchin!

312
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,540
It would appear that the audience has been rendered speechless...

313
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,160
Well, does anyone want to make a higher bid than 500 million?

314
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
There's gotta be something we can do...

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,060
Hey, Sanji?

316
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
Nami?

317
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,500
This can't be happening! They can't take our friend away just because we don't have enough money!

318
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,140
This is bad... We never considered this possibility...

319
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,240
If we can't get her back with money, then the situation has gotten even worse!

320
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,140
If not, then this auction will be quite a short one!

321
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,740
Now that it's come to this, I might as well just take her back by force and run off to the sea!

322
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't be ridiculous! What about the neck-ring?

323
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,840
You'd just blow her up!

324
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,580
Then I just have to get the key to that ring somehow...

325
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,600
That's enough time!

326
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
I did it!

327
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,760
It's like a symbol of how messed up the world is...

328
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,460
I've seen enough of this farce. We're leaving.

329
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
Well then, thank you for your attention up until now.

330
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,240
The main prize this time, the mermaid Camie...

331
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,520
goes to the World Noble, Saint Charlos for the price of 500 million belly...

332
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,380
It's...

333
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,020
What?!

334
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,760
...a deal!

335
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,980
What?!

336
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,220
How noisy.

337
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,280
Luffy!

338
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,740
What the heck?! Couldn't you land any better than that?!

339
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,720
No way! It's a Flying Fish, you know!

340
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,880
And it was you who told me to crash into the building!

341
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,640
Anyway, you told me to get on...

342
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,660
But why were you in such a hurry to get back to the Sunny anyway?

343
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,360
Where are we?

344
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,960
Zoro, too?

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,800
You guys!

346
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,660
Hey, that's Straw Hat Luffy!

347
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,640
What's with those guys? Who are they?

348
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,560
Oh! Camie!

349
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,080
Luffy-chin!

350
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,320
Camie! I looked for you!

351
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
Thank God!

352
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,580
Wait a second, Straw Hat! What are you doing?

353
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,460
What do you mean?! Camie's right there!

354
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,680
She's there, but she's got an exploding neck-ring attached! So you can't just take her!

355
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,040
Besides, the Celestial Dragons are here!

356
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,020
Like I care!

357
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,440
He's a pirate!

358
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
Camie!

359
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,580
Just stop already!

360
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,480
A fishman!

361
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
That's disgusting!

362
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
What's a fishman doing here?

363
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,240
You octopus monster!

364
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,700
I'm gonna save you right now, Camie!

365
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,060
Get him!

366
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,720
Damn you! Camie isn't for sale!

367
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't let him get any closer to the stage!

368
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,280
What's a fishman doing on land?

369
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,300
No, don't get any closer! It's creepy!

370
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,220
Hey, staff! Hurry up and restrain him!

371
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,160
No, don't come here!

372
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,880
Go back to the sea, you monster!

373
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Yeah, that's right!

374
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,300
Get off this island!

375
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,900
Get lost!

376
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,960
Hachi! Hurry up and escape!

377
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,780
You're the one who's in trouble now!

378
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm fine! What about Camie?

379
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,060
What's going on here?

380
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,420
It's just like Robin said...

381
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,420
Mermen and fishmen are discriminated against on this island!

382
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,060
Discriminated against...?

383
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,720
Even Camie and Hachi?!

384
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,500
I hit it! I shot a fishman!

385
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,320
Hachi!

386
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm glad he shot it!

387
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,380
I was afraid that if it came any closer, we might get infected by it!

388
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,720
He was definitely trying to cause some trouble... After all, they've only got the brains of a fish!

389
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,080
Father, please look! I caught a fishman!

390
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,120
I caught it myself, so it's for free!

391
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,240
Free! Free! An octopus for free!

392
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480
I got it, I got it!

393
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,140
An octopus-slave for free! Free!

394
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,660
W... Wait... Please...

395
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,580
Straw Hat...

396
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,540
You can't... get upset...
I was just careless, that's all...

397
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,340
You promised that... even if someone was shot right before your eyes...

398
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,960
you wouldn't lay a hand on the Celestial Dragons, right?!

399
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,380
After all, I used to be a pirate...

400
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,840
I did so many awful things, so...

401
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,940
I had this coming...

402
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,660
Sorry...

403
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
I never wanted this to happen...

404
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,660
I just wanted... to make up for all the things I did to Nami...!

405
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,020
I was trying to help you, but...

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
As always...

407
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,800
I just screw up no matter what I do...!

408
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,600
I really am... clumsy after all...

409
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,500
Hachi...

410
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,900
In the end... I just caused you trouble...!

411
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm sorry!

412
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,620
I'm so sorry!

413
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,140
Damn fish!

414
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,980
Even after I shot you, you keep on blabbering! You're annoying!

415
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,130
You, what's with that look of yours?!

416
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,300
Stop it, Straw!

417
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,980
If you do that, you'll be in huge trouble! Please stop!

418
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,920
What is that guy doing?!

419
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,460
Is he serious?!

420
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,720
You are annoying, too!
