I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550
Chasing and being chased on top of Mobius' ring.

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,600
Alright.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,000
You okay?

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,040
Sorry for the trouble, Straw Hat.

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,640
Thank you, Luffy-chin!

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,540
It's fine!

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,240
You're done over there too, huh?

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,120
Yes

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,820
You people truly are amazing.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,960
No matter how many of'em show up, I wouldn't lose to someone like that!

31
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,980
Damn...! He's too strong...!

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,840
300 million is impossible after all.

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,300
Right now, there are more big shots on the archipelago than ever before, too...

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,400
Damn! If we could just get one of them...

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,080
But, what was that?

36
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,270
The Embers of History

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,780
So many bounty-hunters suddenly showed up...

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,260
That was the third group to attack us.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,180
I can't even see that food-sampling, uhh...

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,040
...I mean, souvenir-shop any more...

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,580
There are fewer people around, and the shops and cities, feel rather suspicious.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
It doesn't seem like the kind of place where we would find a coating mechanic.

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,740
This archipelago is huge, so there are places where the government's eyes can't reach.

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,460
The marines won't go anywhere near this place.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
Have a look at this.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
A map, is it?

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,220
It classifies the groves in groups of ten, based on their specific traits.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,280
Nothing is set in stone,

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Grove 1~29 Lawless Zone

50
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Amusement Park

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Hotels

52
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Tourist Zone

53
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Marine HQ

54
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,640
Shipyards

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,080
but for the most part, it's accurate.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,700
This is Grove 16.

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,780
Groves 1 to 29 are more or less a lawless zone.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
That's why there are so many bounty-hunters around.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,580
Couldn't you have said that sooner?!

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,940
If you had, you could have taken Sanji or Zoro instead of me!

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,620
It's fine now. Our destination, Grove 13, is next.

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,180
Chopper-chin, Skeleton-chin, you were both really strong and cool!

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
That doesn't make me happy at all, you jerk!~

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
I am quite embarrassed, so much that my entire face is red...

65
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,260
Though being a skeleton, I have no...

66
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,260
Sabaody Archipelago






Grove 13

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,380
{\an8}Well then, we're here!

68
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
We finally made it here!

69
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,020
The store is on the top of that root.

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,520
Wonder if it's still open. It's been 10 years after all.

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,720
Say, is the coating mechanic a fishman, too?

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,760
Oh, Pappag and I haven't met him before.

73
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,180
We've heard that he's quite amazing, though.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,280
Oh, really?

75
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,640
{\an8}Shakki's Rip-off Bar

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,620
Shakki's Rip-off Bar?!

77
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,220
Hachi... This place seems like a total rip-off...

78
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,340
That mechanic isn't some sort of monster, is he?

79
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,320
It's fine! They're nice people.

80
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,180
I've known them since I was a kid.

81
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,180
Hey, it says "Bar"! Is that really okay?

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,460
Seems they're open.

83
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,080
Rayleigh, Shakki!

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,800
Bar Owner    Former Pirate

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,800
Shakuyaku (Shakki)

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,820
{\an8}Welcome.

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,780
{\an8}What can I do for you?

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,200
Oh, my...

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,100
Could it be, Hacchan?

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,940
Long time, no see!

91
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,760
Sorry it's been so long, Shakki.

92
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,220
That's right. It's been at least ten years, hasn't it?

93
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,100
Just sit down and wait. I've gotta finish extorting the money out of these boys here.

94
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
Take your time.

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,540
I'll finish it quickly.

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Is that so? You quit being a pirate, Hacchan?

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,940
Plenty of things happened...

98
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,460
Well, good for you. Honesty is the best way to go, after all.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,480
By the way, it's not often that you see a mermaid above the sea...

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,080
Camie-chan, are you Hacchan's girlfriend?

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,900
N-N-No way, I... I couldn't become Hacchin's b-b-b-bride!

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,280
You're overreacting.

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,260
She works with me at the Takoyaki stand.

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,460
Oh, is that it?

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,360
That's right... Would you like something to drink...?

106
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
Shakki-san, these beans are quite tasty.

107
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,860
He's already raided the fridge?!

108
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,880
Luffy! Brook! She's gonna rip you off!

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,740
It's okay I don't mind.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,340
Well, then, I'll give you something good.

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,700
Here.

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Cotton candy?!

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
It's great!

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Right. It'll cost you 100,000 belly.

115
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,060
I... I...

116
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,820
Don't have that much...

117
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,920
Sorry! It was a joke!

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I won't ask for payment from Hacchan's friends.

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,940
Really?

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,220
Lady, how'd you know what Chopper's favourite food was?

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,840
You're Monkey-chan's crew, right?

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
You know me?

123
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,980
Of course. You're the crew everyone talks about.

124
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm pretty well-informed.

125
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,360
Really? Luffy-chin, you're famous?

126
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,660
Though, I didn't know you had a skeleton in your crew,

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,660
or that a living skeleton existed, for that matter.

128
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,920
There, thank you for waiting.

129
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,880
Thanks!

130
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,840
I read an article about you guys.

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
About the Enies Lobby incident...

132
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,680
How much of it is true?

133
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,520
Is it true that you picked a fight with the government?

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,260
Whatever, it's too much trouble to tell you.

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,200
Not gonna brag?

136
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,720
What a big shot.

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,680
Come to think of it, your name is the same as that marine, Garp, right?

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah, he's my grandpa.

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,140
I thought so.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,100
I used to be chased around by him all the time.

141
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,880
Why?

142
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Shakki used to be a pirate.

143
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,180
Really?

144
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,220
I gave up about forty years ago, though.

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
But then... How old are you, granny?

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,600
These days, I think it's fun supporting rookies like yourselves.

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,260
By the way, Shakki...

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
No need to say it. I know, all of it.

149
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,300
The reason why you and Camie-chan came here,

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,120
was to help Monkey-chan and his crew get their ship coated, right?

151
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,020
That was good!

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Here.

153
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
In other words, you've got a job for Rayleigh, right?

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,860
That's right.

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,940
But, he isn't here.

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,260
Huh? The mechanic isn't around?

157
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,700
We wanna go to Fishman Island!

158
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,620
Well, there's no way he'd leave this archipelago, so...

159
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,780
How about looking for him in the bars and gambling houses?

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,620
Then, we'll just wait until he comes back.

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,980
That's right. He'll be back eventually...

162
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,840
He's been gone for half a year, though.

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
Half a year?!

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm sure he's found girlfriends, and thus found places to sleep,

165
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,320
so I am not exactly worried about his health.

166
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,040
I suppose it's just how ex-pirates are. Once they leave, they won't return for a long time.

167
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,900
The old mechanic guy was a pirate, too?!

168
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,160
But this is quite a problem...

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,260
If he isn't here, I suppose we have no choice but to look for him.

170
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,480
Do you have any idea where we should start?

171
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,720
Let's see...

172
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,420
He's probably somewhere between Grove 1 and 29...

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,380
He's quite notorious, so he can't lower his guard when there are marines around.

174
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,440
And then... if he's not there... he also likes going to the Sabaody Park.

175
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,860
The amusement park?!

176
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
Alright! We'll look there!

177
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,480
The amusement park!

178
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Hey, Camie!

179
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Amusement park! Amusement park!

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,400
Anyway, wherever you go to look for him, be careful.

181
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,400
Amusement park! Amusement park!

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,500
According to my information, now that you've arrived, there should be...

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,240
Eleven people on the Sabaody Archipelago with bounties exceeding 100 million Berry.

184
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,440
11 people... exceeding 100 million Berry?!

185
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,860
Not counting Monkey-chan and Roronoa-chan, there are nine others.

186
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,160
When you entered the Grand Line,

187
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,700
there were seven paths you could take and you chose one of them,

188
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,620
and have been following the Log on that path ever since, right?

189
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,480
Yeah.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,040
Of course, there were also people who chose one of the other six routes...

191
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,480
and made it through all sorts of trouble to get here, just like yourselves.

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
No matter what route you take, each of them eventually leads to the Red Line...

193
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,580
and to get past that wall, everyone comes to this archipelago.

194
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,100
Understand?

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,580
Though it's pretty amazing that all of the world's rookies

196
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,500
managed to show their faces here at the same time.

197
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,120
In particular, there's Kid, Luffy, Hawkins, Drake, and Law.

198
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,100
These names have been decorating the newspapers for some time now.

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't read the news.

200
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,500
If we're going by bounty value,

201
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,320
you're number two among them.

202
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,620
There's someone on this island with a higher bounty than Luffy?!

203
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,420
Grove 24






-Restaurant-

204
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,860
What a crazy eating rate...

205
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,700
How can she fit all of it in that body?

206
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,900
Bring me more!

207
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,940
What a vulgar woman...

208
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,720
She's making me lose my apetite.

209
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,300
Silence her.

210
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,060
That's not a good idea, Father! This town is right next to the Navy HQ!

211
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,920
If we cause an uproar here...

212
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,230
West Blue Native

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,940
Bounty, 138 million belly.

216
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,820
Isn't the food here yet?!

217
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
Hurry and bring it here!

218
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,340
It seems they're cooking it as fast as they can, captain.

219
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,880
But, they won't make it in time, at this rate!

220
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,220
Get me more pizza!

221
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:04,390
South Blue Native

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
Bounty, 140 million belly.

225
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,700
W-We'll bring you your food immediately.

226
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,600
P-Please forgive me!

227
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
Why, you...!

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,420
Stop it.

229
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,020
Why would I, captain?!

230
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,360
He got spaghetti on my clothes!

231
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,880
That was the fate of those clothes.

232
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Please forgive us for startling you.

233
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
Today, is a bad day for new acquaintances.

234
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:41,800
North Blue Native






Captain of the Hawkins Pirates

235
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,840

236
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,800
Bounty
294 Million Belly

237
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,800
Bounty, 249 million belly.

238
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,620
What's that? A fight?!

239
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,220
If you wanna fight, why not wait until we've gotten past the wall?

240
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,040
Huh? Don't you know how strong we are?

241
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:06,560
Grand Line Native






Captain of the On-Air Pirates

242
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,760
"Roar of the Sea" Scratchmen Apoo.

243
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,560
Bounty
198 Million Belly

244
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,660
Bounty, 198 million belly.

245
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,240
Well then, stop staring at me.

246
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,480
Boss! Don't do it!

247
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,220
You're such a disgusting guy.

248
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,440
I don't mind finishing you off right now, you know?

249
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:27,110
South Blue Native






Captain of the Kid Pirates

250
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,220

Bounty

252
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,080
Bounty, 315 million belly.

253
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
The mad monk's gone berserk!

254
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,920
We've got to hurry and get away from here!

255
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,160
If you want to cause a stir...

256
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,840
then do it in the New World!

257
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:02,050
North Blue Native






Captain of the Drake Pirates

258
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,880
"Red Flag" X-Drake.

259
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,050
Bounty
222 Million Belly

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,180
Bounty, 222 million belly.

261
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
I see.

262
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
The former officer, Drake, huh?

263
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,390
Sky Island Native






Captain of the Depraved Monk Pirates

264
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,440
"Mad Monk" Urouge.

265
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,390
Bounty
180 Million Belly

266
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,500
Bounty, 108 million belly.

267
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,270
Your life was just spared, masked man.

268
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:29,470
South Blue Native

269
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,780

270
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,470
Bounty

271
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,520
Bounty, 162 million belly.

272
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,900
It was just getting good...

273
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,120
Yo, Drake. How many people have you killed?

274
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,890
North Blue Native






Captain of the Heart Pirates

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,380
"Surgeon of Death" Trafalgar Law.

276
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,890
Bounty
200 Million Belly

277
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,020
Bounty, 200 million belly.

278
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,820
All of the pirate crews that entered the Grand Line,

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,520
have been reduced to an easily countable number.

280
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,280
The Grand Line is like a huge survival tournament.

281
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,280
Regardless of which path they traveled, the ones that survived this far are truly the elites.

282
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,200
Among them, there might be one,

283
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,860
who will become a huge leading figure for the next generation of pirates.

284
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,200
Regardless, even the New World won't remain un-fazed if so many big shot rookies enter at once.

285
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,080
Also, the reason why Captain Kid has a higher bounty than you...

286
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,700
is because his crew has badly injured civilians.

287
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,880
Not too cute, right?

288
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,180
Because of that, I'm whole-heartedly cheering for your crew, Monkey-chan.

289
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,780
Well, for now...

290
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,120
I think I'll just enjoy myself.

291
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,820
Oh, but if there are so many in town, I'm kinda worried...

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,340
about the old mechanic dude.

293
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,740
You don't have to worry about my people.

294
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,580
He's a hundred times stronger than you boys, after all.

295
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,980
A hundred...

296
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,340
times?

297
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,760
Well, be careful then.

298
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,020
I should tell you, of course, the Navy already knows...

299
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,740
that there are so many high-level rookies gathered on this archipelago.

300
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,480
That is bad...

301
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,500
Then, they could come at us at any time?

302
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,380
Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.

303
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,380
I wonder if this will speed up the meeting among rookies?

304
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,200
Right now, the Navy HQ is so busy with something else,

305
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,800
that they don't have the time to worry about you.

306
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,100
Or at least, I assume so.

307
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,060
As long as no huge problems pop up on the archipelago,

308
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,360
The Navy shouldn't send any major force here to deal with you.

309
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,320
So in short, just take care not to start any kind of uproar alright?

310
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Oh, so that's how it is?

311
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,080
Gotcha! Thanks!

312
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,020
We're off to look for the old mechanic dude!

313
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,360
Yeah...that's a problem, huh?

314
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,180
But are you sure about this?

315
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,160
Yeah, Peterman-san...

316
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:20,770
Kidnapping Team "Hound Pets"
Boss Peterman

317
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,520
That woman who was with Straw Hat Luffy and the others was probably...

318
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,380
a mermaid!

319
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,180
When I remember what I saw...

320
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,680
Crap! Camie! Pappag!

321
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,280
The woman's shoe fell off at one point, and there wasn't a foot, but a fin!

322
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Really now?

323
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,820
But it'll be a problem as long as she's with those strong guys, huh?

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,980
That being said, a mermaid on land gives us a huge chance!

325
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
After all, you can't catch'em underwater.

326
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Thanks a lot for telling me, you guys!

327
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,480
As a reward, you can have 10% of the fee we fetch for her, all right?

328
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,080
Ah, if possible, could we have 20%?

329
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,340
Huh?!

330
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,820
No, 10% is enough! Thanks a lot!

331
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,790
Sabaody Archipelago

















Grove 32, 33, 34

332
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,380
Amusement Park
















"Sabaody Park"

333
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,180
We've reached Sabaody Park!

334
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,660
Yay!

335
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,700
Awesome! It looks so fun!

336
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,660
You're not even gonna LOOK for the old guy, are you?!

337
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,120
But the old lady said the old mechanic dude likes it here!

338
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,300
But that was only if he wasn't in the lawless zone!

339
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,640
The ferris wheel!

340
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,920
This is the first time I've been this close to it!

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,580
Right! Then, you guys, let's go have fun!

342
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah!

343
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
You're not gonna look, huh?!

344
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,240
Yay!

345
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,840
Camie! You can't go in there!

346
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,760
No way I'd let you go in!

347
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,660
We are rising quite slowly, aren't we?

348
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,020
What a nice view...

349
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,220
That's right. I truly prefer slow-moving attractions like this one...

350
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,940
Such a really nice view...

351
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,100
Hey, you guys rotated it too fast!

352
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,580
What did you think would happen when you did that anyway?!

353
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,640
You can't do that!

354
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,940
Wow!

355
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,540
We're so high up!

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,020
Awesome! Amazing!

357
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,740
I can see it all from here!

358
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,660
You're so happy that you're crying?

359
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,840
Yes, because...

360
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,940
this has been my dream since I was a child...

361
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,060
This is the first time I've been to a place as high as this!

362
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll remember it for the rest of my life! Thank you!

363
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,240
Hacchin and Pappag let me come here because you guys are so strong!

364
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,980
It's like everything I dreamed of as a kid came flooding back!

365
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,920
All young fishmen and mermen dream of coming here!

366
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,180
Super-high!

367
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,160
Super-high!

368
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,420
Super-high!

369
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,400
Let's ride that next!

370
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,700
A gondola!

371
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,320
Yeah!

372
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,860
Captain Urouge... Is that...?

373
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,680
Oh, my...

374
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,350
Celestial Dragon St. Charlos

375
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,420
A Celestial Dragon, huh?

376
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,100
Casually taking a stroll in the lawless zone...

377
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,420
He's just asking for trouble.

378
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,460
Let's get on our knees and wait it out, guys.

379
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,120
Sharlia and Father have just left me behind...

380
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,560
Where did they get off to?

381
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,860
We know where they were going, so you need not worry.

382
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,360
Brat! You walk as slowly as a turtle!

383
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,760
Also, your ride is the worst!

384
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,460
This guy, he makes me sick!

385
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,520
Hey! You guys, wait!

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Why are you moving? You're just humans and all...

387
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,760
We're sorry! Please, let this slide!

388
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,980
This man is bleeding terribly!

389
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,760
It seems like he's been caught up in a fight!

390
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,340
The hospital is right ahead, too...

391
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,220
It's true, this is quite an injury...

392
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,840
Then, I suppose I'd better hurry...

393
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,140
and put him to rest!

394
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,820
Please, stop!

395
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,580
Oh, my...

396
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,520
Just doing as he pleases, huh?

397
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,020
My well-deserved respect or the lives of lower-class citizens...

398
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,040
Which is moore important?!

399
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,760
It is only through your mercy that they are given life.

400
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,480
I've decided! I shall make you my wife!

401
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,080
What?!

402
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,160
Then, I shall start the paperwork to have her brought to the Holy Land as Lady 13.

403
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,660
Ooh, I am tired of wives 1 to 5, so you may return them to the lower classes.

404
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I understand.

405
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,640
Please wait! I...

406
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Please wait! She's my fiancé!

407
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,880
Another one dares too stand up before me?!

408
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,480
Mary...

409
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
No!

410
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,580
No, you murderer! How could you?!

411
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Someone, please... Please help him!

412
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,140
He's just messed up...

413
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,220
Even more so than they said he was...

414
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
What?

415
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,580
Do you have any complaints about me?

416
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Please let me go! I'm begging you!

417
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,480
Take her too the port!

418
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes!

419
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,580
Who's that?

420
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,000
Captain Apoo! He's the Pirate Hunter from East Blue!

421
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,340
Why is he walking in the middle of the road?! Doesn't he know anything?!

422
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,020
He'll get us all in trouble, that guy!

423
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,040
Huh? You want me to give you directions or something?

424
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, hey! What's he planning to do?

425
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,940
A kid...?

426
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,320
Brother!

427
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Why'd you die?

428
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,600
Brother!

429
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,740
Brother, stay still.

430
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,900
Brother!

431
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,720
You tried to attack the Celestial Dragon-sama?!

432
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,100
Then of course you'd die!

433
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,420
I hit him?

434
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,040
For a moment, it seemed as though he had dodged it...

435
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
Was I imagining things?

436
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,900
Well, as long as he's dead, then it's fine.

437
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,660
Why'd you get in my way?

438
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,760
Huh? Don't say we got in your way, you dumbass!

439
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,200
What the hell were you trying to do?!

440
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,920
Do you WANT the admirals to come to this island?!

441
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,360
Tomato juice...

442
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,420
Even pirates have their own unspoken laws, you know!

443
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,260
You just caused us a whole lot of trouble too!

444
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,440
Trouble?

445
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,460
You're...

446
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,700
Huh? Wasn't there a kid here?

447
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,220
Are you even listening to me?! Are you right in the head?!

448
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,020
Uh, I'm not hurt or anything...

449
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,200
Idiot, I'm talking about what's inside!

450
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,780
You're such a moron!

451
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
Completely brain-dead!

452
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,640
Thanks to Jewelry Bonney, it seems we avoided the worst outcome...

453
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,640
That man is from the Straw Hat crew, Pirate Hunter Zoro.

454
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,500
I heard that crew has done nothing but anger the Government,

455
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,180
but I didn't think they'd be so stupid as to attack the Celestial Dragons.

456
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,580
Of course he was spared.

457
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,740
I do not see the mark of death upon him.

458
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,260
That bastard...

459
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,720
For a moment, he really was ready to kill him...

460
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,540
What a beast.

461
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,220
A second-in-command worth 120 million...

462
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,400
He doesn't seem like the type who'd follow orders...

463
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,020
I guess that's saying something about his captain, huh?

464
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,580
Hey, where's the hospital?

465
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,540
The hospital?

466
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,960
I'll bring this guy there. He got shot.

467
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,360
Just leave that stranger alone!

468
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't believe it.

469
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,400
A pirate helping someone? Never heard of that before...

470
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,380
I just had a look around town.

471
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,840
People were flying around on these bubble-bikes!

472
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,240
Oh, I saw it, I saw it! Those were cool, weren't they?

473
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,400
Let's buy one!

474
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,300
We've gotta find out how they ride'em!

475
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,740
Oh, maybe that's from Nami-san?

476
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,520
Hi, Nami-swa-

477
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,160
Hello?!

478
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,020
It's me!

479
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,480
It's Chopper!

480
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,780
Um, there were so many different kinds of ice cream...

481
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,720
We weren't paying attention!

482
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,060
Hey, what are you so upset about?

483
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,940
Sanji?!

484
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,200
Something terrible just happened! What do we do?!

485
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,020
You're not making any sense! Calm down and tell me what happened!

486
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,500
What's up, Sanji?

487
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,600
Camie has been kidnapped!

488
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,780
What did you say?!

489
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,860
It's probably that team of slave-traders who did it!

490
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,280
I don't understand the reason,

491
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,980
but mermen and fishmen get sold off at the market, regardless of whether they've actually done anything!

492
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,160
They took Camie away!

493
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,400
If she ends up being a slave for the rest of her life, it'll be our fault!

494
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,480
There are so many human shops on the archipelago,
so we have no idea where they're taking her!

495
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,120
And we don't even know who took her!

496
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,700
The archipelago is too big, but if everyone lends a hand, then maybe...

497
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,720
Tell me where you guys are right now.

498
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,700
We'll meet up there.

499
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,980
Huh? But...!

500
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,540
We'll contact a guy who's a pro at this stuff.

501
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,380
I'll call the Flying Fish Riders!

502
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Yahoo! It's me, Handsome!

503
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,000
No, that's wrong!

504
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,360
It's Duval!

505
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
It's Duval!

506
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,680
Greetings, Master Black Leg!

507
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,020
You're late, Flying Fish Riders!

508
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,380
Wait a minute, young master...

509
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,480
We are the Rosy Life Riders!

510
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,360
I don't care what you call yourselves! You're annoying!

511
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,620
Anyway, a mermaid was kidnapped. That's why we contacted you.

512
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,720
Huh? So the slave-traders showed up, huh?

513
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,840
Those guys are unBerryevable!

514
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,840
Hey, weren't YOU slave-traders too?!

515
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,040
There are so many places they could have gone to, so...

516
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,920
You guys! Give us a hand!

517
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,620
Why, of course! Thank you for your orders!

518
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,460
Thank you very much!

519
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,080
Will we really be alright with these guys?

520
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,280
But first, the Handsome me just went to a city where I could find some women.

521
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,280
Huh?

522
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,040
As I expected, I...

523
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,480
couldn't get any...

524
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,740
I might have restructured your face, but I can't restructure your heart, you know.

525
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,100
But don't mind that! I got it, young masters!

526
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,480
We just have to find that mermaid before she's sold, right?

527
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,060
That's right. You guys should know a thing or two about the Sabaody Archipelago, right?

528
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,140
Of course!

529
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,160
We know the seas around here like our own backyard!

530
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,580
Just think of it as having gotten on a really big ship!

531
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,180
Now, get on!

532
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,300
So we are going on this flying fish?

533
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,240
Yes, friend!

534
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm counting on you!

535
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,480
Gotcha!

536
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,860
So, how are we gonna look for them?

537
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,860
Young master, people in this business have their own way of doing things.

538
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,940
We already have information on the various slave-trader teams.

539
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,340
First of, we'll pick up the Straw Hats who are spread all over the Sabaody Archipelago!

540
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,900
And at the same time, we'll also track down the slave-traders who took that mermaid!

541
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,280
Let's get going, you guys!

542
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,420
Yeah!

543
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,290
Sabaody Park

544
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,260
Is this really okay?

545
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,040
Sanji, what do I do?

546
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,620
Listen, Chopper! No matter what, don't move!

547
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180
We'll come get you no matter what!

548
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
Got it...

549
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,420
Hey, Luffy! Sanji said we should stay where we...

550
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,040
In times like this, it's dangerous for us to get separated, right...

551
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,140
Brook?

552
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,360
You're too relaxed! I was really shocked!

553
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,140
Camie was kidnapped, you know!

554
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,720
If she gets sold, she'll end up being a slave for the rest of her life!

555
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,420
Chopper-san,...

556
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,500
Sanji-san was very specific as to what we should do next.

557
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,100
No matter how we spend it, we will still be waiting for a certain amount of time.

558
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,060
I see.

559
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Head, we've arrived at Sabaody Park!

560
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,960
Pick up each one of the Straw Hats, one by one!

561
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,600
Yeah!

562
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,400
The #5 public snail-phone should be somewhere around here.

563
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah, it's here! There they are! Those two on that bench!

564
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,820
Hey, you two!

565
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,840
What the...?!

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,380
Why are you so freaking relaxed?

567
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,160
Let's go! We're initiating our great plan to save Camie!

568
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,460
Yes! It's time to give it our best! Let's go!

569
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,960
We... we got yelled at, Brook!

570
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,880
Ashamed! I am slightly ashamed!

571
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,540
Split up and keep going! Investigate all of the slave-trading organizations.

572
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,780
Find out who did it! And don't forget to pick up the remaining Straw Hats!

573
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,740
Understood! We're splitting up!

574
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,400
Alright! Hurry up, Rosy-Life Riders!

575
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,940
There's not a minute to lose!

576
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,800
That should do it.

577
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,280
That's not enough! Can't you do anything about this cow?!

578
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
I should have gone on a flying fish too!

579
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,640
Huh? Did you just say that I'm handsome?

580
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,500
I never said that! You're the damn Head, aren't you, Duval?!

581
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,480
Why aren't you the fastest one in the team?!

582
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,820
What are you saying?

583
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,800
Of course I'm the most handsome one in the team!

584
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,700
Just speed this thing up, you moron!

585
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,200
Alright, we're here!

586
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,100
Meanwhile













Grove 22 Human Shop

587
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,420
Are you sure nobody tried to sell you a mermaid here?

588
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,600
I'm sure! Nobody has been here!

589
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Stop it, Straw Hat! If you cause a commotion, it'll just make it harder to look!

590
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,260
Squid! Let's search the store!

591
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,060
Alright.

592
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,640
Hey!

593
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,020
How'd it go, squid, Pappag?

594
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,140
She's not here.

595
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
Camie!

596
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,840
Guess there's no helping it... Let's look somewhere else, Straw Hat.

597
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,080
Well, wait a minute. It seems that we have one mermaid here after all.

598
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,580
Really, there's a mermaid here?!

599
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,740
The only mermaid we have here is this lady here, Marin!

600
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,240
She's nice and cheap too. Want her?

601
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,100
Will you buy me, boy?

602
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,540
You're not a mermaid!

603
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
Wait, aren't you that guy we saw earlier?!

604
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,800
It's hard to breathe in water!

605
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,100
Hey!

606
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
Camie!

607
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,940
Camie!

608
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,360
Where are you?!

609
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,920
We don't know if she's been sold yet... 
If only we knew who took her, at least...

610
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,040
Hey, look at that!

611
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,840
That's Straw Hat Luffy from East Blue!

612
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,380
Damn it! This is my fault!

613
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,000
I knew that the amusement park is the best spot for the slave-traders...

614
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,860
and how much they'd want to capture a mermaid...!

615
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,340
Hey, these guys have so many types of ice-cream, huh? What do you guys want?

616
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,760
Hey, let me pick one too!

617
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,300
Camie, wait here for a minute.

618
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,220
Sure! Pick out a tasty one for me too.

619
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,940
I don't want that to be my last conversation with Camie!

620
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,400
It's my fault... It's because I let her go to the amusement park...!

621
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,100
Yes, because...

622
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,180
this has been my dream since I was a child...

623
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,680
This is the first time I've been to a place as high as this!

624
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll remember it for the rest of my life! Thank you!

625
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'm not sure I understand, but she was so happy!

626
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
It was fine to bring her to the amusement park, wasn't it?!

627
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,560
No, it wasn't!

628
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,200
Actually, mermen and fishmen shouldn't even be on this island in the first place.

629
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,060
But...

630
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,360
...Hachi just wanted to help you guys out no matter what-

631
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,520
Pappag! Don't say any more!

632
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:41,060
What's he talking about? Why can't you guys be on this island?

633
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,880
Camie and Hachi's enemies here aren't just the slave-traders.

634
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,260
Every single human living on this archipelago is an enemy!

635
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,860
200 years ago?

636
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,840
Grove 30
Shopping Mall

637
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,360
Yes. Until just 200 years ago, that dark history was reality...

638
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Fishmen and mermen were considered normal fish,

639
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,660
and were discriminated by humans all over the world.

640
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
Everyone looked down upon them.

641
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,800
Those strong fishmen?

642
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,900
Even the strongest creatures are powerless when outnumbered.

643
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,500
This continued until the World Government decided to lend a helping hand to Fishman Island 200 years ago.

644
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,820
That's just another piece of the dark history of the human race.

645
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,300
On this archipelago, slave-trading and selling of human lives is still acceptable.

646
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,520
So I think, maybe the discrimination of mermen and fishmen is still common here, too.

647
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,080
Discrimination?

648
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm the fool here for not remembering that this is one island to avoid...

649
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,500
That's why I should have stopped Camie, no matter how cruel I'd have to be...

650
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,920
Then, could that be the reason why Hachi and Camie had to disguise themselves on this island?

651
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,620
I hope I'm just reading too much into things, though.

652
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,620
Bratty girl! Robin!

653
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,240
Franky!

654
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,760
Hey, stop calling me "bratty girl"!

655
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,560
Hurry up and get on the flying fish! That mermaid was kidnapped!

656
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,440
Camie-chan?!

657
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,720
Kidnapped?!

658
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,960
Camie...!

659
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,780
Sorry, Straw Hat... I just wanted to help, but I ended up causing you trouble...

660
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,060
What're you guys saying?

661
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,560
I never thought you did anything wrong!

662
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,000
The three of you are my friends!

663
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,040
No matter what might happen, we'll definitely save Camie!

664
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,060
So stop crying!

665
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,220
Straw...

666
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,500
You...!

667
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,780
Straw Hat!

668
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,760
It's the Flying Fish Riders!

669
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,220
We've been looking for ya... Get on!

670
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,580
Hey, squid... Are you gonna fly too?

671
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,300
Yeah!

672
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,110
Sabaody Archipelago - Grove 1

673
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,280
Human Auction House

674
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,280
Back Door

675
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,360
Be sure to get a good price for her!

676
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,960
She'll definitely catch a high price! Come back for your share later!

677
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,780
I'll look forward to it!

678
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,220
Oh, my! Saint Roswald! Lady Sharlia! Welcome!

679
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm afraid that it will be hard for everyone to get on their knees while talking inside the hall...

680
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,800
I do not mind. They may bid freely.

681
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,280
Thank you very much! Well then, let me take you to the VIP seats.

682
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,280
Big Brother Charlos is so late...

683
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,560
It is because he chose to ride on a lowly human.

684
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
If he was going to ride, he should have used a fishman.

685
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,680
They have 10 times the strength of a man, after all.

686
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,980
Celestial Dragons... Slaves... The Human Shop...

687
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,580
That's...

688
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,380
Captain Kid, from South Blue!

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
Compared to the "righteous" greed of the rulers,

690
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,020
the villains of the world seem much more honorable.

691
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
When scum rules the world, only more scum is born...

692
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
You don't even understand that?

693
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,820
At least we're honest about being bad people, right Killer?

694
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,200
You're right.

695
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,280
How about we buy anyone who seems interesting?

696
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Chief Kid, look at that.

697
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,600
I know that face...

698
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,040
It's the 200-million man from North Blue, Trafalgar Law.

699
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,000
I heard some bad rumors about him.

700
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,920
His manners are bad, too.

702
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,900
Disco-san!

703
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,420
We've got something incredible today!

704
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,340
Today's big draw is a giant, right? I already know.

705
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,340
Leave it to me. I'll be sure to get a good price for him.

706
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,460
Are the cherry blossoms prepared yet?

707
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,220
Wrong! It's a mermaid! A young mermaid!

708
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,620
I'm sure the bidding war will be fierce!

709
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,080
Really?

710
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,360
Let me go! That hurts!

711
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,640
No, Hacchin!

712
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,800
Why, this one...! If you don't want to get hurt, then stay still!

713
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,000
Hey, don't be so rough with such an important item!

714
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,000
Disco-san!

715
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,320
Oh, so this is the one? The mermaid that just came in...

716
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,840
Yes.

717
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,280
How rare! She seems lively and healthy!

718
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,100
We should fetch quite the price for this one!

719
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,460
Who brought her here?

720
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
The Hound Pets.

721
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,040
Peterman, huh? He's done a great job.

722
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,700
Doesn't seem like the Flying Fish Riders brought in anything this time, though.

723
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,180
Well, regardless, this one should bring in a lot of money.

724
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,120
What's with that face?!

725
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,260
Why you...!

726
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,200
You're just a damn fish! Know your place!

727
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,360
Wait, Disco-san! She's an important item! If you hurt her, her value will drop!

728
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,820
If you have to kick her then at least, do it somewhere where her clothes will cover it, like her stomach!

729
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,280
Hacchin will definitely come and beat you up!

730
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,740
She still has the nerve to talk back to me...

731
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,880
Hey! Give me the neck ring!

732
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,900
Yes...

733
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,760
I'll put this on her.

734
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,380
No!

735
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,060
Disco-san!

736
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,060
Hey, what happened, Disco-san?!

737
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,320
The show is just about to start, too!

738
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,780
Doctor! Get a doctor!

739
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,640
Hey, gramps!

740
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,840
Quit pretending.

741
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,480
That was you, right? That "Haki" just now.

742
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,820
Who the hell are you?

743
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,400
Just an old man who coats ships.

00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:52,090
