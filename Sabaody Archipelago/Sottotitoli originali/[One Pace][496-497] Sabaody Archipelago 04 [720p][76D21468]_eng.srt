Share the music, even if it's far.

Share the one dream, by telling each other.

I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,020
Adventure on the Archipelago











of Dancing Soap Bubbles

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,660
It's good!

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,260
Right?

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,420
Hacchin's takoyaki is the best in the world, isn't it?

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
I can't stop, I'm unstoppable!

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,180
This takoyaki is great!

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,550
It really is good.

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,980
How does he bring out the taste of the sauce like this?

28
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,080
There's just something great about a food stall at sea, huh?

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,680
This is the first time I have ever eaten takoyaki.

30
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,130
It tastes really good.

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,970
It feels like my stomach is going to burst...

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,310
... although I have no stomach.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,440
Eat as much as you like, it's free today!

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
It's our way of thanking you for saving us!

35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,730
These have Dashi in them, and these have Mochi.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,310
They're hot, so be careful.

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,280
So...

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,150
What does she think...?

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,020
Uh, Nami, I mean...

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,340
Uh...

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,210
Well...

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,320
H-How does it taste?

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,660
It's not like I'll forgive you just because of this, you know.

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,900
Of course not!

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
That's not what I meant!

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,520
I just wanted to know what you think, honestly!

47
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
It's really good!

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,370
Really?

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,840
Is that so?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,930
Great, what a relief!

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,400
Alright, you guys!

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,980
Feel free to eat as much as you want!

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah! Just keep making more!

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,600
I'll eat all of it!

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,480
Hey, you guys~!

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,500
Young masters~!

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,890
Who's that?

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,180
That voice...

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,330
Wait, wait!

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,460
Don't leave without giving us a chance to thank you!

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm Handsome...

62
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,820
Oh, that was wrong.

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,320
It's me, Duval!

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Was that how his face looked...?

65
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,940
I altered his bone-structure.

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,640
He shouldn't have anything to complain about now, right?

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,780
My, Master Black Leg...

68
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,420
After you smashed my face in, we were all really surprised when I woke up!

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,920
You've made me really handsome!

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,540
I can't even recognize myself any more!

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,370
Now, the ladies will be crazy for me.

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,430
I must say...

73
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,850
It truly is a rosy life!

74
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,920
I want to go back to my lazy country-life as soon as possible...

75
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,660
But if I left without showing my thanks to you, I could never forgive myself!

76
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,170
This is your first time visiting these parts, right?

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
If there's anything we can help you with, just call us!

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,420
Don't wink if you're not used to it!

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, as long as you're satisfied, that's good enough.

80
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,660
If you wanna do us a favor, then don't bother us again...

81
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,900
Beautiful...

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,340
Too beautiful!

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you even listening?!

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I want to ride on a white horse...

85
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,260
Hey, listen!

86
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,780
Head...

87
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,600
Head!

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
Listen to what he's saying!

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
Oh, that's right...

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,260
What?

91
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm handsome?

92
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,480
I never said a single word about that!

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,500
It is somewhat embarrassing, but... I accept it!

94
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,110
Your fair maiden's kiss~!

95
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,360
I wasn't doing anything like that!

96
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,480
I was just wiping off the takoyaki!

97
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,750
What's with that ridiculously positive attitude of yours?!

98
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,780
Oh, mirror, mirror...

99
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,400
Am I the most handsome man in the world?

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,820
You're only giving it one choice?!

101
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,260
We get that you're handsome, but you're still an idiot.

102
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,660
Jealousy?

103
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,920
No way!

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,910
Stop it, Usopp!

105
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,130
You're no match against his craziness!

106
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,030
Well then, young master!

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,150
This is my snail phone number.

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,840
Feel free to call me whenever you like!

109
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,770
I'll definitely help you out when that time comes!

110
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,370
I really did cause you a lot of trouble, huh?

111
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,580
I am really... sorry!

112
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,720
Let's go, Rosy Life Riders!

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
Yes, handsome!

114
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,280
Hurry up and go.

115
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,960
Ah, I'm full!

116
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,640
Ah, I ate a lot!

117
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm in Heaven!

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,730
Ah, what a wonderful afternoon...

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,470
This is the first time I have eaten takoyaki..

120
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,070
I am quite satisfied, too.

121
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,110
Ah, excuse me.

122
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,020
That was too dirty!

123
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm exhausted...

124
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,980
They sure ate a lot...

125
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,220
As expected of the Straw Hat crew...

126
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,790
I wish I had six more arms.

127
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,320
Good job, Hachi!

128
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,200
Seems like they're all satisfied.

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,300
Really?

130
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,920
Then, I'm satisfied too.

131
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,360
That was really good!

132
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,840
I can't eat any more...

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,750
Hey!

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,320
Octopus, starfish, Camie-chan!

135
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,260
If you want a break, then come up to the deck.

136
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,640
I'll give you a cup of tea.

137
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,440
Yeah!

138
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,660
That's some good tea!

139
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,760
This is the course we're gonna take.

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,140
We're headed for the Sabaody Archipelago.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,320
We can't get to Fishman Island without going there first?

142
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,300
We Fishmen and merfolk can just dive straight down to go back.

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,630
But you're humans, so if you tried to dive down there, the pressure would kill you!

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,660
Indeed...

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
The submarine couldn't reach it either.

146
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,940
Alright, pay attention!

147
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,380
It seems like you don't know anything...

148
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,640
So I'll tell you a thing or two about these seas!

149
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,300
Huh?

150
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,520
Who is gonna do that?

151
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,520
That...

152
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,100
Would...

153
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,000
Be...

154
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,100
Me!

155
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,080
Uh, would you please listen?

156
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,160
To start with, there are actually two routes you can take to reach the New World!

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,700
But only one of them is accessible for outlaws, like yourselves!

158
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,960
Why?

159
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,480
Well, that's because...

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,290
One requires the World Government's permission,

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
for you to cross the Red Line by going over the top,

162
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,780
through the Holy Land Mariejoa at its summit!

163
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,480
Of course, there's no way a pirate would be allowed to pass through like that.

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,380
You mean, walking over the Red Line?

165
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
Then what would we do about the ship?

166
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,050
You'd have to leave the ship behind, and get a new one on the other side.

167
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,310
Leave the ship behind?!

168
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,190
Yeah.

169
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,540
Getting permission takes both time and money, but it's the safest way to get there.

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,220
However...

171
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,770
Huh?

172
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,010
The passage you're taking will allow you to get through with your ship and everything!

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,130
That passage is known as...

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,060
The Ocean-floor Route, which goes straight by Fishman Island!

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,040
But the Ocean-floor Route is pretty dangerous as well.

176
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,580
Huh?

177
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,040
Camie, Camie?

178
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,520
What do you mean?

179
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,410
I didn't say you could take over...

180
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,190
There are plenty of people who are eaten, along with their ships, by sea-monsters and Sea Kings.

181
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey!

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,900
I get it...

183
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,560
That would be pretty dangerous.

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,360
Right?

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,140
I don't want to go to Fishman Island after all...

186
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
Me neither...

187
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,940
Wait a minute, Camie!

188
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,040
Did you just say "along with their ships"?

189
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,600
Huh?

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah!

191
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,000
What kind of ship can we use to travel on the ocean-floor?

192
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,380
This ship.

193
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,480
Huh?

194
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,310
Hey, this ship can't travel under water!

195
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,100
No, it'll be alright.

196
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,760
Huh?

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,600
You see, inside of that huge wall, that circles the whole globe, the Red Line...

198
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,300
there's a small hole in a certain spot.

199
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,880
Although from our perspective, it's a huge hole.

200
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,120
And that's where Fishman Island is!

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,580
Actually, it's right underneath the Holy Land, Mariejoa!

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
You just head about ten thousand meters down, and there it is!

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,710
That far down?

204
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,120
It's a really nice place!

205
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,180
Wasn't Sky Island about ten thousand meters up in the sky, too?

206
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,760
What do you mean, we're going to take this ship to the ocean-floor?

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,740
We're going to get the ship coated at the island we're going to now.

208
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,620
Coated?

209
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
Now, look ahead!

210
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,730
Everyone, we're here!

211
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
It's beautiful!

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,380
What is that?

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
Something's flying around...

214
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,870
Well, I must say...

215
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,040
A true wonder.

216
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
Bubbles...?

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
This is...

218
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,590
Grand Line
Sabaody Archipelago

219
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,360
Sabaody Archipelago!

220
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
There's tons of soap-bubbles floating around!

221
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,080
Beautiful!

222
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,100
What's going on?

223
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,900
They just keep floating up, one after another...

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,680
Who's blowing them all?

225
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,480
They're rising up from the island.

226
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,940
Just saying that they're rising doesn't really help...

227
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,840
Why?

228
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,540
If I may...

229
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,360
Sorry for interrupting, but is the Log Pose alright?

230
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,380
Oh, right...

231
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,520
It's still pointing to Fishman Island, but...

232
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,600
Say, won't this island cause it to change its course?

233
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,980
You don't have to worry about that.

234
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,500
The Sabaody Archipelago is just a lot of trees.

235
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,340
Then, those aren't really islands?

236
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,200
Correct.

237
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,320
Have you ever heard of mangrove trees?

238
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,060
You mean trees with roots in the ocean that sink and emerge with the tides, right?

239
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,820
That's right.

240
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,060
Although the mangroves here never sink.

241
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,660
The Sabaody Archipelago is the largest mangrove in the world.

242
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,900
They call the trees here the Yarukiman Mangroves.

243
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,340
{\an8}"Yaru ki manman": To be pumped up.

244
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,280
Pumped up groves?

245
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,880
Yeah, they sure look like they're excited!

246
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,760
I'm getting excited too!

247
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,020
In all, there are 79 trees, and all of them are like small islands.

248
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,240
There are towns or other structures on each one.

249
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
All of the islands together are known as the Sabaody Archipelago.

250
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,920
The closest grove, grove 44, is the civilian entrance, so let's take the ship a little closer.

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,300
Now that we're seeing them up-close, those roots really are huge, huh?

252
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,920
Is that a bridge?

253
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,560
Yeah.

254
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
That's how each of the islands are connected.

255
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,720
Alright, we're here!

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
This is grove 41.

257
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,340
This is where we're dropping anchor.

258
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,420
I'm setting foot on it first!

259
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,510
Alright everyone, don't forget the number here!

260
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Like I said earlier...

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,880
All of the islands are connected via bridges...

262
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,300
So if you remember the number, you won't get lost.

263
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,280
Even then, there is one guy who'll get lost, right?

264
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,260
There is.

265
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,280
Huh, what?

266
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,240
What is it?!

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,900
One popped out from the ground!

268
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,050
That's really funny!

269
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,280
Awesome!

270
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
I got on it!

271
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,180
It's not popping, huh?

272
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,540
That's really nice!

273
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,060
Those soap-bubbles really are mysterious.

274
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,240
How do they work?

275
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,540
The roots of these Yarukiman Mangroves... secrete a unique kind of resin.

276
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,980
Oh, no!

277
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,180
This is all sticky.

278
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,940
Don't wipe it off!

279
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,300
So, when the trees "breathe out", the resin {gets}is blown out as well, and forms these soap-bubbles.

280
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,620
I see...

281
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,260
So that's why they're all floating into the sky?

282
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,900
So all of this is actually natural?

283
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,940
Hey!

284
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,420
Huh?

285
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,240
Hey, Luffy!

286
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
When did you get up there?!

287
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,700
I can see an amusement park over there!

288
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,320
Let's go!

289
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,620
Let's ride the ferris wheel!

290
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,000
An amusement park?

291
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
That's the Sabaody Park.

292
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,520
How nice...

293
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
The ferris wheel...

294
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,260
Riding on that is my dream.

295
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,440
Your dream?

296
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,600
Why can't you ride it?

297
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,560
Don't be ridiculous!

298
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,820
You can't do that, Camie!

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,510
Yeah, I know...

300
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,460
I want to ride it too, but I guess I can't...

301
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
By the way, Hachi...

302
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,340
What's our goal on this island?

303
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,460
You said something about coating for the ship earlier, didn't you?

304
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,080
We have to find a coating mechanic, and have him coat your ship with this resin!

305
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,440
Simply put, that will enable your ship to travel under the sea!

306
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,860
Seriously?

307
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,520
That's the only way humans can reach Fishman Island.

308
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,100
However, if you get an amateur to do it...

309
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
The ship, and the humans riding it, would be crushed by the water-pressure.

310
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,480
I know one mechanic who's trustworthy, so I'm gonna take you to him.

311
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,260
Octopus-san, you are such a nice fellow for helping us so much...

312
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,360
Ah, he is a nice octopus!

313
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,980
In exchange...

314
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,920
I'd like you to make just a single promise to me.

315
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,740
Sure, what is it?

316
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,520
Once we enter the city, we might run into the World Nobles walking around there.

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,020
Who are they?

318
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,600
The citizens of the Holy Land, Mariejoa.

319
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,220
And, what about them?

320
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,940
No matter what might happen in the city...

321
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,430
I want you to promise that you won't lay a hand on the World Nobles!

322
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,600
Even if someone were to be killed...

323
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,940
Right before your very eyes...

324
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,780
Just pretend you didn't see anything!

325
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,680
Everyone left for the town...

326
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
You're not going?

327
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,480
We used up all our cola in that battle back there.

328
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,000
Taking care of the ship is my job!

329
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Of course, I wanted to help out as well!

330
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,300
Once we're done, let's head out, all three of us.

331
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,060
This island looks fun!

332
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,780
Nah...

333
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,540
I can't leave the ship before someone comes back.

334
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,000
Huh, why?

335
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,600
Well, you see...

336
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,200
My beloved Nami-san said...

337
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
Hmm, this is a problem...

338
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,340
We've got tons of treasure stored on the ship right now...

339
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,940
Is there a knight around who would safeguard it?

340
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,240
Ta-daah!

341
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,880
It's me!

342
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,240
You really do anything Nami wants you to, huh?

343
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,160
I am a slave of love!

344
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,320
There's no point if you admit it yourself...

345
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,420
Huh?

346
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,640
Hey!

347
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,660
Zoro!

348
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,780
Hello?!

349
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
Zoro-kun?!

350
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,280
Where are you going, all by yourself?

351
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,800
For a walk.

352
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,900
So what?

353
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,400
Stop it!

354
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,440
Don't! You'll get lost, dammit!

355
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,940
This is an Archipelago, you know?!

356
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,300
We won't be able to find you!

357
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,280
Like I'd get lost!

358
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,440
Who'd get lost on an island like this, where it's so easy to find your way?

359
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,920
Each of the trees have a number on them, right?

360
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,590
Even a kid with the worst sense of direction would be able to find his way!

361
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,140
You'd thought that far ahead?

362
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,460
I didn't think of that.

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,180
Sorry!

364
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,320
Be careful!

365
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't forget to ask for directions!

366
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,740
Don't believe in yourself!

367
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,200
They're going way overboard.

368
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,540
As long as I don't forget the number on this tree...

369
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,500
Number one, right?

370
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,100
The World Nobles are also known as the Celestial Dragons.

371
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,260
They're really arrogant, and wear a mask so they don't have to breathe the same air as everyone else.

372
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,060
No matter what, don't try to oppose those guys.

373
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,380
I need you to promise that!

374
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,060
Sure!

375
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,940
And there are several other things to look out for.

376
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,160
Like I said earlier, this island is where everyone who wants to go to the New World, gathers.

377
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,320
There are plenty of big-name pirates like yourselves...

378
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,400
And then there are marines and bounty-hunters trying to catch them.

379
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,640
Also...

380
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,000
Kidnappers!

381
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,240
Even if pirates are taken away by slave-traders, the law won't protect them.

382
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,380
If you do anything to get yourselves noticed, they'll go after you instantly, so be careful!

383
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,020
The marines around here are not to be taken lightly.

384
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,960
These waters are close to the Navy HQ, after all.

385
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,200
All the bounty-hunters around here are on a totally different level as well!

386
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,560
And there's one more thing...

387
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,960
What's that?

388
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
You're too concerned about stuff!

389
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,580
Camie and I are not a mermaid and a fishman, okay?

390
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,640
While we're here, please pretend that we're ordinary people.

391
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,600
Why?

392
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,460
It's just easier that way.

393
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,260
We should follow the customs of the culture around here, Luffy.

394
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
Let's just do as the octopus told us to.

395
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,640
There we go...

396
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,320
Slowly, slowly...

397
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm in!

398
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,560
How amusing!

399
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
It really is mysterious...

400
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm getting into it!

401
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,140
None of the air is coming out, either!

402
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,860
Well, then...

403
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,980
How about putting this in?

404
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,940
Like this?

405
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
Is that about the right height?

406
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,680
Now you can drive around with it.

407
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm moving!

408
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,620
Awesome!

409
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,100
This is fun!

410
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,120
It is not breaking!

411
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,920
Aren't they convenient, the Sabaody Archipelago's exclusive Bubble Bike?

412
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,130
How about it?

413
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,040
If you want to rent it, it's 500 Belly per person.

414
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,240
If you want to buy it, it's 1,000 Belly!

415
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Cheap, isn't it?

416
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,580
Then, we'll rent one.

417
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,480
I want one!

418
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,520
I'm gonna buy it with my spending money!

419
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,900
Me too, me too!

420
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,600
Don't.

421
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,500
There's no point in buying it, just rent one.

422
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,260
Why should you get to decide that?

423
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,100
That's right!

424
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,400
Uh, I'll tell you the reason later.

425
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,000
Old man!

426
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,440
We'll rent two more of them.

427
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,920
Oh, you're a local, huh? That's too bad...

428
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,760
This feels great!

429
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm definitely buying one of these Bubble bikes!

430
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,880
Straw Hat...

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,960
You rode the soap bubbles into the sky when we first got here, right?

432
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,460
Why did you fall?

433
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,440
Oh, well, when I reached the top of the trees, I thought I'd go even higher...

434
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,780
But then all the soap bubbles around me suddenly started popping...

435
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,780
And then the one I was riding did, too...

436
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,780
So, I ended up falling.

437
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,620
That's because you left the Sabaody Archipelago's unique atmosphere.

438
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,140
This place has a special, unique climate specifically suited to the Yarukiman Mangroves.

439
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,880
But once you leave that climate, the soap bubbles won't be strong enough to stay whole.

440
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,680
Is that so?

441
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,680
Then, that means that you can only ride the soap bubbles...

442
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,580
for as long as you stay on the island, doesn't it?

443
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,580
That's how it is.

444
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,380
People who come here for the first time often buy a Bubble bike...

445
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,740
But that's basically a rip-off.

446
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,700
Renting one is good enough.

447
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,020
No, I think I'll buy one!

448
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,140
I don't accept that explanation at all...

449
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,200
You don't get it, do you?

450
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,420
In short, once you leave the island, the soap bubbles will break.

451
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,100
It's mysterious, isn't it?

452
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
What?!

453
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,750
They just mysteriously break?

454
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,140
Why didn't you say so right away?!

455
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,480
Ah, but Luffy-chin, you can use them at Fishman Island.

456
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,240
We've got soap bubbles on the ocean floor too.

457
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,720
I wanna go to Fishman Island soon~

458
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,580
I'm really looking forward to it~

459
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,300
In that case, you should meet the mermaid princess!

460
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,450
She's so beautiful, I can't even describe it!

461
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,040
I can't look away from her myself!

462
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,740
I will be looking forward to that!

463
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,280
I have a good eye for beauties...

464
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,040
Though being a skeleton, I do not have eyes.

465
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,520
Eh, are you listening?

466
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,900
Wow, this looks good!

467
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,640
What's Graman?

468
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,670
{\an8}Manjuu: Steamed bun

469
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,670
They're Grand Line Manjuus!

470
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,020
Or Graman for short.

471
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,540
Would you like to taste some?

472
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,080
You can see that it's got "Grand Line First Half" written on it, right?

473
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,820
The idea is to take them into the New World as a souvenir of sorts.

474
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,720
They'll last for about three months, so don't worry about it!

475
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,520
This tastes great!

476
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,120
May I open another package?

477
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,460
Aren't you gonna buy any?!

478
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,920
Grove 35...

479
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,220
There are lots of hotels here, aren't there?

480
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,560
It's the living quarters for those waiting for permission to pass through Mariejoa.

481
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,060
It's really easy to make these hotels...

482
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,740
See that over there?

483
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,520
They just coat those huge soap bubbles in a special alloy, and the foundation is done.

484
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,160
That's how they make those round buildings.

485
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,480
Really?

486
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,680
Robin!

487
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,620
Isn't that a shopping mall?!

488
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,300
Come back any time!

489
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,420
Grasen...

490
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,700
Grachoco...

491
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,940
A key-holder!

492
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,840
A pennant!

493
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,790
Hold on to those memories!

494
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,220
You bought a lot of them, huh?

495
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,740
Carrying that around everywhere should be a problem...

496
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,600
Put them in the Bubble bag.

497
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,940
Bubble bag?

498
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,660
It's so light!

499
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,540
You don't need to put in any effort to carry your luggage on this island, huh?

500
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
Huh?

501
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,280
Where did Nami and Robin go?

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
They went to the shopping mall in Grove 30.

503
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,640
They said they'd leave the coating of the ship to us.

504
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,980
Oh, so that's it?

505
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,960
Right!

506
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,220
Leave it to us!

507
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,700
Even though we invited her, Camie-chan wouldn't come with us...

508
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,820
She's seemed more reserved ever since we arrived on this island...

509
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,140
What could be bothering Camie?

510
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,360
Perhaps there is some sort of bad history on this island...?

511
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,000
Bad history...?

512
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,900
I'm in the lead!

513
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,880
Don't get cocky!

514
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
There's still a long way to go!

515
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,540
Go, Hacchin!

516
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,420
How did this turn into a race?

517
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,980
What's all the commotion about?

518
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,860
I'm begging you!

519
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,760
Hey!

520
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,440
I'm asking you a favor here!

521
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,320
Anyone's fine!

522
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,200
An axe!

523
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,360
A saw!

524
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,980
Anything will do!

525
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,320
Just give me something!

526
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,540
I just want to get this off my neck!

527
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,380
I won't hurt anyone!

528
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
Please let go of me...

529
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,640
I don't want to die...

530
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,360
I've given up on going to the New World!

531
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
I've got a wife and a child back home!

532
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm begging you!

533
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,440
Please lend me a hand!

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
I wanna go home!

535
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,460
Last time I saw my kid, he was still a baby...

536
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,720
He still doesn't even know what I look like!

537
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,370
I'm begging you!

538
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,720
He's...

539
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,220
I wanna go home!

540
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Hey, please!

541
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,010
Please help me!

542
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,560
Don't get involved.

543
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,900
He's probably a pirate who was caught by kidnappers and sold as a slave...

544
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,500
His owner probably brought him to this island, and he made a run for it!

545
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,500
Even though he should know that he can't escape!

546
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,560
W-What's that sound?

547
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,780
Damn!

548
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,040
This ring!

549
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,020
If I could just get this off my neck!

550
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,800
Damn it!

551
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,620
No!

552
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,580
Stop!

553
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,740
Please stop!

554
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,580
Hey!

555
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,640
Hey!

556
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,220
Damn it all to Hell!

557
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,580
Slaves always have those chains attached to their necks...

558
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,110
If they try to take them off or run away, they'll explode!

559
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,520
Just let me buy some souvenirs and go home...

560
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,980
I've given up on being a pirate...

561
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,280
It's a slave who tried to run away!

562
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,160
Get away!

563
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,670
Don't get involved with him!

564
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,200
L-Look at that...

565
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,140
We have to help him!

566
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,780
Idiot!

567
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,300
You promised to not get involved, no matter what, right?!

568
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,940
What's with this city?!

569
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,620
Hacchin, what are we going to do?!

570
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,680
The Celestial Dragons are nearby!

571
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
It's alright.

572
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,820
Calm down, Camie!

573
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,900
Straw Hat!

574
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,380
Get out of the Bubble bike!

575
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,940
Huh?

576
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,740
Why?

577
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,220
Just hurry up and do it!

578
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,760
Uh, sure...

579
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,120
They're here!

580
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,160
Are those the Celestial Dragons?

581
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,680
You have to bow down too!

582
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,540
Why?

583
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,800
No matter what, don't look them in the eyes!

584
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,850
My, how vulgar, Saruu!

585
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,740
Them, huh?

586
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,180
Celestial Dragon
Saint Roswald

587
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,180
Celestial Dragon
Saint Shalria

588
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,100
Oh no, Father.

589
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,340
Yet another one has been broken.

590
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,640
Did you make sure to give him his tranquilizer every day?

591
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,060
Why, yes, I did.

592
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
However, it appears that it does not work on fools...

593
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,900
Would you please buy me a new one?

594
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,200
Your disciplining skills are truly terrible.

595
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,260
You keep destroying my captain collection, one after another...

596
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,960
This one is certainly useless.

597
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,560
A grown man always crying about family this, family that...

598
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,040
You are just a mere human!

599
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,340
He can't even move any more!

600
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
You disgust me!

601
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,200
Why, that-!

602
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,480
Please, wait!

603
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,460
I would like a giant slave next.

604
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,420
You should start with a human child.

605
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,100
But I detest the weak.

606
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,100
Please don't do anything rash!

607
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,280
It's the marines!

608
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,020
Move it, move it!

609
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,320
First off, we should get away from here!

610
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,480
How about some tea?

611
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,940
It will help you calm down.

612
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,760
I feel terrible...

613
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,060
Do you think that guy will be alright?

614
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,180
He's a pirate, so even if they save him, he'll just be sent to prison.

615
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,300
That pirate should be able to beat that old guy and the woman, right?

616
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,300
Why?!

617
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,600
If you hurt one of the Celestial Dragons...

618
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,300
An admiral from Navy HQ and a fleet of battle ships will come here.

619
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,220
An admiral...

620
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,060
Aokiji?!

621
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,040
It could be Akainu or Kizaru...

622
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,840
There's no way to know who'd show up.

623
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,960
The HQ is right next to us, after all.

624
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,420
What makes those guys so special?!

625
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,780
Those guys are descendants of the creators!

626
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
The creators?

627
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,400
800 years ago, a group of 20 kings formed the organization known as the World Government.

628
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,080
The Celestial Dragons are their descendants.

629
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,130
And over the course of the years...

630
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,480
They've come to abuse their incredible influence.

631
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,920
The Celestial Dragons...
