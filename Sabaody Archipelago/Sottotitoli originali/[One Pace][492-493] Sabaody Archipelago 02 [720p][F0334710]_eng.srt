00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,710
I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550
Chasing and being chased on top of Mobius' ring.

It begins, it expands, this flavor that exceeds imagination

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,870
Iron Mask Duval

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
The Flying Fish just... left?

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,200
Even though they were focused on the attack back there...

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,590
It seems like they received some kind of message.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,800
Maybe they were ordered to retreat? Although I wouldn't know why...

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,180
I wanna ride those! Those Flying Fish can stay in the air for five minutes, huh?

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,060
Awesome!

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,800
Anyway, we're now headed for their base, right?

28
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,780
Awesome!

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,040
In that case, we'd better be prepared to fight them again.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,560
But who'd have guessed that they'd come at us from the sky?

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,040
How about getting the cannons out on the deck?
I'll shoot them all down!

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,060
Nice thinking!

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,580
I wonder if Hacchin is alright...

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,800
You know, Macro is really after you!

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,020
You've gotta be careful too!

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,800
East of the
Sabaody Archipelago
The Flying Fish Riders'
Headquarters

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,280
Duval-sama! The three of them have returned!

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,320
Duval-sama, why'd you order us to pull back?

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
I'd like to know that too.

40
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,840
You could have just left the capture of the mermaid and the pirates to us!

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,140
You idiots!

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,720
You guys...

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,450
Kidnapping Gang
"Flying Fish Riders"
Head
"Iron Mask Duval"

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,620
{\an8}Do you have any idea how long I've been anticipating...

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,420
The arrival of...

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
Those pirates?!

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,980
Whenever I think of dat man... {Note that Duval's strange accent is intentional. Do not change it.}

48
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,460
This huge, great scar on my back starts throbbin' like hell!

49
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,600
O-Oh, crap! The Head's mad!

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:36,000
Ev'ry single day... I've cursed dat man's name ev'ry single day!

51
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,250
Head, please calm down!

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm gonna kill dat guy right here, today!

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,270
Got it?!

54
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,240
Dat's my life-long, immortal wish!

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,220
Do ya understand?!

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,040
Y-Yes! That guy can't be allowed to live!

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,840
And dat's why ya gotta make sure to do this properly! Dat's how we'll get'im!

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,120
You punks just follow my orders exac'ly!

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,020
Yes, Head!

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Hey, Macro-crew!

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,300
Huh? You called?

62
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,260
What is it, Duva?

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,900
"Duva"?" Whaddaya mean, Gyaro?! And what's with the "Huh", Tansui?!

64
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,100
Ya guys should learn some better manners!

65
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,400
{\an8}Heh, "Duva", that's funny!

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Macro Pirates
Gyaro
(Pop-Eyed Goldfish Fishman)

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,000

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,000

Tansui
(Arowana Fishman)

69
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,840
{\an8}Geez! Oh, you called, Master Duval?!

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,720
Boss... This guy's totally freaked out...

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Oh, shut up!

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,420
Ahhh, I apologize profusely, Master...

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,490
These guys are complete idiots, they don't even know what they're sayin'!

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,420
Oh, it's fine, you guys.

75
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,840
To me, you're like my angels of good fortune.

76
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,680
I can't even say how thankful I am to you.

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,740
Go on.

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,360
I told you to shut up, Tansui!

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,100
Thanks to you guys... at last...

80
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,080
I can meet them...

81
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,660
The Straw Hat... Pirates!

82
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,380
Straw Hats? Who're they?

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,830
The Straw Hats? So it wasn't just my imagination?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
Listen up...

85
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Dat guy...

86
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,520
Dat guy I bin waitin' all my life ter kill is on dat boat, a'ight?!

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,560
I ain't never gonna forgive dat punk!!!

88
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,540
Head! Calm down, please!

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,660
He really does hate that guy, huh?

90
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,120
I never thought I'd hear the name "The Straw Hat Pirates" here...

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,860
Hey, you, the big guy!

92
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,920
It's Duval-sama! Show some manners, you damn octopus!

93
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,440
Takoyaki Shop Owner
Hacchan
(Octopus Fishman)
Former Officer of the Arlong Pirates

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an8}Are you saying that Camie has been captured by the Straw Hat Pirates?!

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,940
This is bad... Of all the people to run into...

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,360
Are they coming here as well?

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,960
Yeah, they're heading here right now.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,530
But ain't it your mermaid friend who's turned to the pirates for help?

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't know the details, but it doesn't seem like she's been caught.

100
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,260
Well, no matter who she brings with her,

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,360
as long as we're here, we'll just catch'em all and sell them to the Human Shop!

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,240
As if they could do that!
Those guys are terrifyingly strong!

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,020
This is a problem... I wonder if Nami's there too...

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,500
I wonder if she's still mad at me...

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,300
Well, of course she would be...

106
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,040
I did those horrible things to her when I was with Arlong, and all...

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,520
If I don't hurry up and escape before those guys get here, they'll definitely beat me up, too...

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm in trouble!

109
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,320
Duval-sama! The Straw Hats are here!

110
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,220
They're finally here?

111
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,960
Say, Macro...

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,660
Huh? What is it?

113
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I'll give you lots of takoyaki, so could you please let me go?

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,540
Yeah, right! Dumbass! What kinda glutton do you take me for?!

115
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,460
Is that man on the ship?

116
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes! He's definitely there!

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,700
It's about time for you to pay the piper, an' all! Prepare yourself!

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,650
Looks like that's the Flying Fish Riders' base.

119
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,220
And this Hacchin-guy is being kept over there?

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,300
I'll go in there and save him in a flash, Camie-chwan~!

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,870
Thanks a lot, Sanji-chin!

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,890
Oh! But everyone! Please be careful!

123
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,020
The Macro Crew alone have captured me about 30 times!

124
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,340
You get captured too much!

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,280
You get eaten too much too.

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
This isn't really an island, though. It seems like someone built a village on top of the water.

127
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,900
But why would they want to set up their base here?

128
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,480
Who knows...

129
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,340
Anyway, it sure is quiet here.

130
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,980
Luffy! Should we really...

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,220
Forward!

132
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,420
Shouldn't we at least think of a plan?!

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,940
Hey! Hacchin! Are you alright?!

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Get out here, Macro! Give Hachi back!

135
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,200
Oh, crap! It really is the Straw Hats' ship!

136
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,400
Damn it!

137
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,470
I really can't get out... Well, in that case...!

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,420
Octo-Hachi Black!

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
It seems like someone is inside that cage.

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,860
Could that be Hacchin...?

141
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,700
This is great, Camie! There aren't even any enemies around!

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,160
They must all be off having a snack!

143
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,540
Are you guys serious?!

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,220
Anyone could tell that this is a trap!

145
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,100
Everyone is obviously hiding in there, waiting to ambush us.

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,970
What insight!

147
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,880
I-I never would have considered that!

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,100
That's why you keep getting caught!

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm here! Camie, I'm okay, so you don't have to worry!

150
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,740
You're all black! What happened?!

151
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,620
Well, this is kinda my own fault...

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,960
Anyway, this is a trap, so hurry up and turn back!

153
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,940
You know that I'm strong, right? So it's fine, just go!

154
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,200
That voice is really familiar, and then there's that unusual silhouette...

155
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,900
Hey, Nami, what do you think?

156
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,540
There's something very suspicious about him...

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,320
What?

158
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,740
We'll know if we ask him, right?

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey! Is Arlong doing alright?!

160
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Huh? Arlong?

161
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,320
No, him, Choo, Kuroobi and everyone else got caught by the Navy.

162
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,660
I was the only one who escaped, and I'm now living out my old dream of running a takoyaki-stand.

163
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
Arlong...?

164
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,300
So it was you, huh? You damn squid!

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,060
Damn it!

166
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,800
So you're that damn squid who was with Arlong?! You're that takoyaki-seller, Hacchin?!

167
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,170
What?

168
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, it was a while ago now...

169
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,540
Nami's hometown was once under the control of a nasty crew of fishmen called the Arlong Pirates...

170
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Nami was in quite a terrible situation herself...

171
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,320
And that octopus was one of the top-members.

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,880
So he's an old enemy, huh?

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,660
Of course, I took Luffy and the others along, and kicked the crap out of the whole crew!

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,480
Usopp, you're awesome!

175
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,170
Y... yeah, I guess...

176
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,980
I thought all the fishmen were arrested by the Navy... But it seems like that guy managed to get away...

177
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,100
I see. You have gone through a lot...

178
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,860
Hey, squid! Now that we know it's you, there's no way we'll save you!

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,880
B-But...

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,920
I-Is your takoyaki really as good as I heard it was?!

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, come on! Getting caught between your appetite and your reason?

182
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,280
How stupid.

183
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,620
You mean, you know Hacchin?

184
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,140
Is Hacchin an old friend of yours?

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,580
He's not our friend!

186
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,760
Turn the ship around!

187
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,480
Nami-chin...

188
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,100
Sorry, Camie...

189
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,790
We never would have thought your friend was that guy...

190
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,100
No way...

191
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,000
You won't help me save him after all?

192
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
Hacchin!

193
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,040
Camie! That's okay! Just turn back! This is a trap!

194
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,340
No... I'll save you...

195
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,860
Hacchin, you're always saving us after all!

196
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,840
Pappag!

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,540
That's right! I never thought you guys would be such a load of unfeeling halfwits!

198
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Idiots! Idiots!

199
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,480
Shut up!

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,940
Wait for us, Hachi!

201
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,500
We definitely won't abandon you, Hacchin!

202
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,600
Here we go!

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,460
Camie-chan!

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,300
We've got you now, Camie!

205
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh, come on, that's just pathetic!

206
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,780
Now we're gonna be rich!

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,740
With Hachi, who always saves you, in that state and all!

208
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,360
You won't get away, Camie!

209
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,980
That's why I told you to run! Camie! Pappag!

210
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,640
Why, you... Camie hasn't done anything!

211
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,080
Wait, Sanji-kun!

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,440
Fine, let's save Hachi as well.

213
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,560
Hachi isn't that bad! Actually, he's harmless.

214
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,160
And we did make a promise to Camie.

215
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,840
N-Nami-swan... That firm, determined appearance is just wonderful!

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,860
Hey, Nami...

217
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,200
Is that really fine?

218
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

219
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,720
Luffy!

220
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,580
If you say so, then I guess there's no choice.

221
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,640
Let's save the octopus as well.

222
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,600
Your eyes turned into takoyaki!

223
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,370
Are the preparations ready...

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,270
Flying Fish Riders?

225
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,040
Of course, we're always prepared!

226
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,280
Rubber...

227
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,210
Pistol!

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,820
Wait a minute!

229
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,140
He's a Devil Fruit User?!

230
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
Straw Hat?

231
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
Damn him!

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,380
Luffy-chin!

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,580
You...

234
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,530
Alright! I got them back!

235
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,780
Straw Hat! Thank you so much! I'm indebted to you!

236
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,140
Zoro! Cut the octopus' ropes and the cage!

237
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,780
Sure!

238
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,200
Straw Hat! Be careful!

239
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
You've already sprung the trap!

240
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,140
The Flying Fish Riders have you surrounded!

241
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,580
Charge!

242
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,720
Yes sir!

243
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
Luffy-chin...

244
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,480
Whether it's from the sea, or the sky, we're ready for'em!

245
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,800
We're gonna beat'em all!

246
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,180
You guys!

247
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,980
Prepare for battle!

248
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,950
Yeah!

249
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,960
Damn it... Now, while we have the chance, let's take Camie back!

250
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,980
Camie! Pappag! It's dangerous, so stand back!

251
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,680
Get them! Go, Luffy-chin!

252
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,560
Now, come, Flying Fish!

253
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,380
Get them, get them, go, go!

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,860
Here they come!

255
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
Alright!

256
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,500
Well, well...  Who's got the freshest fish here?

257
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,280
Alright! Him!

258
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,760
I got him!

259
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,940
What?

260
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,020
My turn!

261
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Uh, wait...

262
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,220
This is awesome!

263
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,060
Whoo! I'm flying!

264
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,760
Luffy's riding one of those things?!

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,220
Ignore him.

266
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,020
Take this!

267
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,200
Bombs!

268
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,280
Damn!

269
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,140
Too dangerous! That was close!

270
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,400
Geez... If they had hit a lady with that, I wouldn't have let them live.

271
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,700
Pull in the sail! It'll get in the way!

272
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Everybody, dive!

273
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,660
Understood!

274
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,580
Luffy!

275
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
Luffy-san!

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,840
We're in the middle of a fight, so what the heck do you think you're doing?!

277
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,240
I'b sowwy...

278
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,580
Oh, and why'd you two try to save him? You're Devil Fruit users too, right?!

279
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,120
I'b sowwy...

280
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,880
I seem to have troubled you, too...

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,440
It's even worse when we have to save all three of you hammers!

282
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,740
Idiot, don't waste my time!

283
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,740
The Macro crew!

284
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,660
Now, let's get Camie back while we have the chance!

285
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,540
Yeah!

286
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,820
Hey, Straw! Could you give us a hand here?

287
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,440
You freed me from the ropes and the cage! Thanks, Roronoa! You're a nice guy, huh?

288
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,260
It was the captain's orders, idiot.

289
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,540
Hachi!

290
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Hacchin!

291
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,220
You guys! You took advantage of the fact that I couldn't move and beat me as much as you wanted!

292
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,700
I haven't punched you yet, Hachi! I'll finish you off with my Fishman Karate!

293
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,700
Man, you've got terrible luck!

294
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,120
Stop flappin' your mouth like that, damn it!

295
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,640
We've got much worse in store for you!

296
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,730
Now, come! I've developed a new style of Goldfish Fencing just for you!

297
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,200
The waters will be stained with blood!

298
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
Hacchin!

299
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,960
Takoyaki Punch!

300
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,480
We'll let you go for now!

301
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,020
Hacchin!

302
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Camie! Pappag!

303
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm so glad, Hacchin!

304
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm so sorry, Camie, Pappag! I was going to save you!

305
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,990
Don't worry about it, Hachi!

306
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,540
Ah! Watch out!

307
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,780
Don't forget that this is our territory! After all, the ones who caught you in the first place...

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,420
Were us, the Flying Fish Riders!

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
Roronoa!

310
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,760
Zoro-chin!

311
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,620
You need to watch yourselves...

312
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,190
Get back. You can just leave this to us.

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,620
Thanks for everything, Roronoa!

314
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm really sorry for what happened back then!

315
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I hurt you pretty badly with my Six-Sword Style...

316
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,600
You didn't even land a single blow, as far as I remember!

317
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,710
Oh, that's right.

318
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,280
We did it, Chopper! Now, take this!

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,960
Fire!

320
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,780
Bullseye! Did you see that, you damn fish?!

321
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,660
Usopp, you're amazing!

322
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,840
Anyone up for the Zero Fight?

323
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,090
The Zero Fight?

324
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,960
Interesting! But isn't that move life-threatening for us too?

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,640
I'm sure that you will be more than up to paying the medical fees?

326
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll give you a million!

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,900
I'll do it, Head! I'll go! Move, move, move!

328
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,420
A really huge guy is coming! And he's swinging a massive club...

329
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,760
He isn't steering at all... Don't tell me that he is just going for a collision...

330
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,690
If that giant hits us at that speed, the ship won't hold...

331
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,960
Luffy! You take care of the fish.

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
Sure.

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,480
Interesting... With this size and speed, the impact will be like a small meteor!

334
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
He's not changing his course at all, just like Sanji said!

335
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,220
However, he's not the only one... who can deal some damage while in the air!

336
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,740
Rubber Balloon!

337
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,740
This'll be our dinner tonight!

338
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,130
That's so cool, you two!

339
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,250
Looking at it up close, it really is big.

340
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,720
Damn... This crew doesn't seem like it'll go down easily.

341
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,640
Now that I look at it, there are a lot of them flying around up there...

342
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,280
How many will we have to beat before it ends?

343
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,040
I wanna ride one, dammit! Don't think I've given up just because of what happened earlier!

344
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,200
Give it up! I won't save you again!

345
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
How can this be?

346
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
What's up, Brook?

347
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,080
To think that my first real action as a member of the Straw Hat Crew was to drown...

348
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,940
It would be a disgrace if I did not help you!

349
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,600
It is about time we reduced the number of those Flying Fish...

350
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,120
Please observe!

351
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,300
What an incredible jump!

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,660
What's with that skeleton mask guy?

353
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,000
We'll skewer you!

354
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,610
Lullaby Song

355
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,120
Flan!

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,400
Wow! They all fell asleep...

357
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,640
You too?!

358
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,760
Music is... Power!

359
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,780
Excuse me!

360
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,100
We fell asleep!

361
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,420
Damn him, what was that?!

362
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,460
He used some sort of dirty trick!

363
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,390
It is no trick!

364
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,560
It is music!

365
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,900
Wait!

366
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
He's pretty good, that Brook!

367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,940
Looks fun... Here I come!

368
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,120
Wait, Luffy! Not again!

369
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,600
Alright, I caught you! I won't forgive you if you dive again!

370
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,380
Hey, you're asleep?!

371
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,880
Hey, hey! Wake up!

372
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,440
That guy! He went into the Head's room!

373
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,860
You saw it...?

374
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
You...!

375
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,680
It seems like you know me...
