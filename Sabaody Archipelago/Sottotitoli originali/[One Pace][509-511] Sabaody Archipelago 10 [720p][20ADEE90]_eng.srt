00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,710
I believe, until the next tomorrow, hey

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,550
Chasing and being chased on top of Mobius' ring.

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
I feel so good throughout my body, I will become free, oh yeah

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,790
Share the music, even if it's far.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,730
Share the one dream, by telling each other.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Share the good times and laugh.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,740
I'll keep going until I can reach the sky.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's overcome it now, I believe in the next tomorrow yeah yeah...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,560
You were waiting there on the other side of the invisible wall.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll be there soon, I believe in one world yeah yeah...

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,290
Kizaru vs. the Four Captains

21
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,070
Unbelievable!

22
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,630
From his hands, and from his mouth, too?

23
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,290
Scary!

24
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,570
Another one's coming!

25
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,770
Just what the hell is that?!

26
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,130
Like they said, it's a beam!

27
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,790
A beam is just a ray of light!

28
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,830
Having something like that working as a weapon is just a fantasy!

29
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,630
Uh, what are you doing?

30
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,810
Playing dead.

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,170
He already knows you're not!

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,480
Three Sword Style

33
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,530
Rubber

34
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,570
Diable

35
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,810
Mouton

36
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,810
{\an8}Mutton

37
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,850
Jet

38
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,110
600 Pound

39
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,430
Cannon

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,370
All right!

41
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,370
Did they get him?

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,250
They're awesome!

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,150
The opponent is a Warlord.

44
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,590
They can't beat him so easily.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,910
I can tell just from their expressions.

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,670
Is he really that different?

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,550
Does that mean that he's his twin or something?

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,270
Yeah, that is a possibility.

49
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,700
Anyway, if he was the real guy, then he would have instantly dodged our attacks.

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,110
More importantly, he's not shooting out shock waves, and he doesn't have pads.

51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,440
But if he's a fake, then that's a problem as well.

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,980
That means that there are two people as strong as him.

53
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,470
You hurt me pretty badly...

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,990
But don't think that I'm the same as I was earlier!

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Karmic Retribution

56
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,650
"Mad Monk" Urouge...

57
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,330
How can a man who was so badly injured until now...

58
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,410
Have gotten this big and strong all of a sudden?

59
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,170
That was Kizaru's laser!

60
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,630
Did you manage to put Kizaru's destructive power into Bartholomew Kuma's body...

61
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,050
Vegapunk?!

62
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,090
Are the Pacifista already this advanced?!

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,830
This is getting out of hand!

64
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
Yeah, even three men worth over 100 million...

65
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,990
Can't possibly survive when they're up against a Warlord and an admiral!

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,730
Rear admiral Drake...

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,030
No, former rear admiral...

68
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,110
Didn't you come here to see this?

69
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,780
If you'd like to try fighting, then go ahead.

70
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,530
Seeing how you know the circumstances already...

71
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,280
I guess you're just too terrified to try, right?

72
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,330
But try not to lose your cool, my flimsy little friends.

73
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm here too, after all.

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,010
Well, I just got to see another interesting thing...

75
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,670
This is the first time I've seen a rare, ancient Zoan-type.

76
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm surprised to see that even you have red blood in your veins.

77
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,070
I just saw something really unusual...

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,110
I said that I'm here too, didn't I?

79
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,470
One after another...

80
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,070
Seems like all you people worth over 100 million are monsters.

81
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,740
That's pretty scary!

82
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,090
Phase of Demon Subjugation

83
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,770
He vanished!

84
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,990
M-My eyes!

85
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,250
Captain Hawkins!

86
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,150
I can't see!

87
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,710
I don't know what kind of ability you possess, but you have a physical form...

88
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,270
So I suppose you're not a Logia-type.

89
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,750
Captain!

90
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,750
This is bad!

91
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,370
He's exceeded his damage limit!

92
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,690
He's really gonna die!

93
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,290
Here's the first one...

94
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,750
Good work making it this far in your long journey.

95
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,470
Is this music reachin' you?

96
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,010
If you hear me, then tune in!

97
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,790
Navy admiral Kizaru!

98
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,350
He's the "Roaring Tide"...

99
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,830
Everybody, listen to my fighting music!

100
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,830
What?

101
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,610
Here we go!

102
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,550
Check it out!

103
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,190
Well, I doubt a navy admiral would die from something like this, though...

104
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,470
Wow, I sure got to see a lot of interesting stuff.

105
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,210
Well, I'll be getting out of here now.

106
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,810
See ya!

107
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,950
That's awful...

108
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,850
Ooh, what a surprise...

109
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Mirror of Yata

110
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,090
Huh, what?

111
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,830
Hello?

112
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,370
Huh?

113
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,230
Hello?

114
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,090
Oh, here it is.

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,850
Borsalino here.

116
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,950
Old man!

117
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,630
You did have your baby snail-phone with you!

118
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,570
Why didn't you contact me?!

119
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,170
Oh, Sentoumaru-kun!

120
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,330
Don't just say "Oh"!

121
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,670
What're you doing?!

122
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,770
You've arrived on the island, right?!

123
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,530
Well, I couldn't get in touch with you, you see...

124
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,870
I bet you tried to talk into the black snail-phone again, right?!

125
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,330
I told you before, the black snail-phone on your arm is just for tapping!

126
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,410
Oh...

127
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,630
Oh...!

128
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,370
Whatever!

129
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,430
Just hurry up and get back to work!

130
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,570
We've already identified our targets!

131
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,410
Straw Hat Luffy, Captain Kid, and Trafalgar Law, who do you wanna start with?

132
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,450
Oh, is that so?

133
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,860
Then...

134
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,520
Sabaody Archipelago


















Grove 12

135
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
Zoro!

136
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,280
Hey, Zoro!

137
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,040
Were you really so badly injured that you can't move?

138
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,400
Leave him alone, Luffy!

139
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,900
We've gotta defeat this thing first!

140
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,320
Yeah...

141
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,680
There's no way his wounds from back then could've healed completely...

142
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,170
From what I can see, just standing up to face the enemy must be really painful for him.

143
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,400
If this bastard isn't Bartholomew Kuma, then who is he?!

144
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,710
He looks exactly like one of the Seven Warlords...

145
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,710
What the hell is going on?!

146
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,920
Hey, Zoro!

147
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
Split-Hoof

148
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,680
Roseo Blizzard

149
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,740
Chopper!

150
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,980
Strong Hammer

151
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,900
Franky Boxing

152
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,760
Spider Net

153
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,760
We can't take his physical strength lightly either!

154
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,100
Take care!

155
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,780
Here I go!

156
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,800
Swallow

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,420
Bond En Avant

158
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,020
H-huh?

159
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,060
I have stopped!

160
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,280
W-Wait, that's dangerous!

161
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,200
Are you planning on killing me?!

162
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,220
...Though I'm already dead...

163
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,560
Wait, this is no time to be saying that...!

164
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,460
Sure Kill Atlas Comet

165
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,960
Now's our chance! Let's run!

166
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,880
That was scary! Thank you so much!

167
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,820
Huh? He's acting strangely...

168
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,280
What? Bombs work on him NOW?

169
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,240
One shot went inside his mouth... Something inside his body must have short-circuited...

170
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,040
His body might be tough, but he's still got blood on the inside.

171
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,040
He's had his entire body modified to become a weapon, just like me...

172
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,660
but he's really a normal human!

173
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,400
Nami-san, watch out! He's found you!

174
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,820
Oh, no!

175
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,340
Ochenta Fleurs

176
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,340
{\an8}Eighty Flower

177
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,900
Cuatro Manos

178
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,900
{\an8}Four Hands

179
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,840
Shock!

180
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,400
You did it! He fired off the beam inside his own mouth!

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,980
He self-destructed!

182
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
Sorry to interrupt your break, mister...

183
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,080
But you should watch out for lightning there!

184
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,060
From dark clouds to the Clima Tact...

185
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,400
Thunder Lance Tempo!

186
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,220
That one definitely worked... Fantastic!

187
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,720
It didn't work at all, did it?! He's still perfectly fine, isn't he?!

188
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,000
Once you get desperate, the fight is over.

189
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,580
Hey, blast him over here!

190
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,960
You're too damn stubborn...

191
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,360
Diable Jambe

192
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,220
Flambage Shot!

193
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,220
{\an8}Flambé Shot

194
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,140
Alright! He's finally starting to fall apart!

195
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,100
Demonic Spirit

196
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,160
Nine Sword Style

197
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,240
Asura!

198
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,740
W... What is that?!

199
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,960
Zoro multiplied?!

200
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,540
Nine Demonic Flashes

201
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,460
Gear Third!

202
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's go!

203
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,360
Go, Luffy!

204
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,500
We just need one more hit!

205
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,200
Rubber

206
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,080
Crush him, Luffy!

207
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,620
Giant Rifle!

208
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm shrinking!

209
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,640
We stopped that bastard, right?

210
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,880
We must have...

211
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,020
It almost seems like he's gonna start moving again... Creepy...

212
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,260
If he does, we're doomed.

213
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm totally beat, I can't move anymore.

214
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,160
Maybe we should've escaped, instead of trying to fight him?

215
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,200
No, if we can beat him, then that's what we should do.

216
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,640
He'd chase us wherever we went.

217
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,320
But what was with that guy anyway?

218
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,860
He's definitely a modified human...

219
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,820
That means that he was once a human who looked just like Bartholomew Kuma.

220
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,240
I'd guess they were twins, or perhaps they just found someone who looked super similar...

221
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I suppose that's the most likely explanation.

222
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,860
There's no way they could've actually created a human, after all.

223
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,760
PX-4?

224
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,280
Let's rest for a bit...

225
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,720
I never thought we'd be forced to go all-out in a battle so soon...

226
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,020
I want to rest, but we should find a hiding-place first.

227
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,300
If they find us now, we're in big trouble, you know.

228
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,380
I guess that's true.

229
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,320
But...

230
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,260
Wait just a minute, okay?

231
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,880
Man, you guys have really done it now!

232
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
What?! Another enemy?!

233
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,820
Where'd that voice come from?!

234
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,880
Up there! They're up there!

235
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,420
Who's there?!

236
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,740
Hey, hey! What a pitiful state you're in, PX-4!

237
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,540
Just building one of you Pacifista costs us as much as an entire warship!

238
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,500
Man, how am I supposed to explain this to that damn Punk?!

239
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,270
Navy Headquarters












Captain of the Science Patrol

240
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,100
Sentoumaru

241
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,160
Another Warlord!

242
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,240
D-Don't tell me that's the real guy?!

243
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
Doesn't matter whether he's real or a fake...

244
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,740
We don't have the strength to stand up to that thing again!

245
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,360
He just said "Pacifista"...

246
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,560
"Pacifista"... That's like someone who creates peace, right?

247
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,460
Is that the name of the one we just defeated?

248
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,680
Who are you, broadaxe?!

249
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,880
You don't call a man by his weapon's name!

250
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,340
There's no point in asking me questions.

251
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,260
I have nothing to tell any of you!

252
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,160
I'm the man with the toughest guard in the whole world!

253
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
Of course, my mouth is well-guarded too!

254
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,580
Can't you at least tell us your name?!

255
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,240
I have no obligations to answer that!

256
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,420
Didn't I just tell you? I'm the world's most tight-lipped man, Sentoumaru!

257
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,360
Really? Sentoumaru, is it?

258
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,580
I just felt like telling you that!

259
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,200
I wasn't answering your question!

260
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,300
Let's go, PX-1!

261
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,040
He's firing beams from his palms too...

262
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,220
He doesn't have pads.

263
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,540
I didn't want to think about it, but that makes him the third!

264
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,640
What's going on?!

265
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Rather than wondering about that,
it'd be safer for us to run away right now!

266
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,240
If we get into another fight now, someone will definitely die!

267
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
Let's run before we meet the admiral...!

268
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah...

269
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,020
Let's run away from here!

270
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,080
We can't stay together... We'll split up and escape!

271
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,820
I think we should run, too!

272
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,420
The three of us should split up!

273
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,220
Sure... Are you gonna be alright?

274
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,140
Shut up!

275
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,720
I'll protect Nami-swan!

276
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,340
Even if it costs me my life!

277
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,160
Right, thank you. Let's get going!

278
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,060
If you're ready to risk your life, then you should be the decoy for all of us!

279
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,340
Ladies only, damn bastard!

280
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,460
Just take care of yourself, panty-man!

281
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,860
Zoro-kun will protect me as well as he can, so don't worry!

282
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,900
Wait a minute, Usopp! I'm hurt...

283
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,320
Do not worry! I shall cover for you!

284
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,320
Your injuries still haven't healed, right?

285
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,040
To tell you the truth, I saw your act of self-sacrifice back on Thriller Bark!

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,760
I see...

287
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,140
Thanks!

288
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,600
We're running over there!

289
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,240
Right.

290
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,160
Those beams are scary!

291
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,960
Everyone, we'll meet up at the Sunny in three days!

292
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,860
They're splitting up and running!

293
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,340
Chase them, PX-1!

294
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,280
Don't let them get out of Grove 12, or we'll be in trouble.

295
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,020
Sure Kill Super Smoke Star!

296
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,240
Now's our chance!

297
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,760
You are quite reliable!

298
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,660
Damn! The bridge!

299
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,820
Here he is!

300
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,500
Why did he come here?!

301
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,540
Hey, hey... You...! Hey!

302
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,040
Don't push me!

303
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,320
He went that way? Are they alright?!

304
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,900
You don't have time to worry about others!

305
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,120
I don't have anything against pirates though.

306
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,180
Rubber

307
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,720
Gatling!

308
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,160
What?!

309
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
What did he just do?!

310
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,000
You've got some pretty good offensive power, but...

311
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,920
My guard is the strongest in the world!

312
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,150
Leg Locked, Heave-Ho!

313
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,980
Luffy!

314
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,060
What?! He's this strong, too?!

315
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,680
I just thought I'd tell you, I'm not a devil fruit-user!

316
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,520
There's something strange about his techniques...!

317
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,560
W-What?! Who are you?!

318
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,420
You... Get away!

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,560
Get away from Zoro, you freak!

320
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,100
Z-Z-Zoro-san!

321
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,840
Zoro-san was hit by a beam!

322
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,780
Hey, Zoro, pull yourself together!

323
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,220
Man, he's late!

324
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,960
So you finally arrived, old man Kizaru?!

325
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,880
Kizaru?!

326
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,400
Be careful! That man is a navy admiral!

327
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,500
Admiral?!

328
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,140
Oh, you're a bit too late...

329
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,240
120 million bounty-head, "Pirate Hunter" Zoro...

330
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,700
I'd heard that you were a reasonably accomplished swordsman...

331
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,860
But seeing how you were beaten with one shot, I suppose you're pretty exhausted, huh?

332
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,120
Damn...

333
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,320
He's an admiral...?

334
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,260
Take yourself a long rest...

335
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,760
Zoro!!!

336
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,920
Hey, he can fire beams too!

337
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,980
This is bad! We've gotta do something!

338
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,700
If he's hit at such a close range, he'll die!

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh no! Zoro's in trouble!

340
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,440
Usopp!

341
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,500
You... Stop it!

342
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,640
Damn it! Why?!

343
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
I can't hit him!

344
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,820
I can't stab him either! What do we do?!

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,460
Damn!

346
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,460
You...

347
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,580
Move your leg!

348
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,740
Please move!

349
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,560
That's no use.

350
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,180
I ate the Light Fruit, I'm a light man.

351
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,580
I'm a Logia.

352
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,920
Light man?!

353
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,860
You're kidding, right?! He's gonna die!

354
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,620
Zoro! Run!

355
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,320
Zoro!

356
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,820
My body... won't...

357
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,460
It's no use! That guy is at his limit already!

358
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,140
Veinte Fleur!

359
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,140
{\an8}Twenty Flower

360
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,320
Alright! Great, Robin!

361
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,940
I won't let you get away.

362
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,580
It's useless.

363
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,360
You'll die now.

364
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,500
So, now you decide to appear...

365
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,440
"Dark King", Rayleigh?

366
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,610
I won't let you take out these youngsters.

367
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,210
Their era is only beginning!

368
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,850
Pops!
