Huh?

1165
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,980
Yeah, it's happened a few times, I guess.

1166
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,560
Including by you.

1167
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,120
Were it clad in Haki,

1168
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,150
that same sword would not have shattered.

1169
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,400
The slightest nick to your blades is a shame to you.

1170
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,700
Every sword can become a Black Blade.

1171
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Until you master it, drinking is forbidden.

1172
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Huh?!

1173
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,040
No nicks.

1174
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,360
Behind the Former
Royal Plateasu

1175
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,350
Was anyone harmed?

1176
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,020
No, sir. It's all thanks to you, Isshou-san.

1177
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,240
Because you temporarily levitated those stones, there are no casualties.

1178
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,360
Luckily, we already set up downtown as an evacuation zone.

1179
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Well done.

1180
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,900
Port town Acacia

1181
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,290
Did you see that?!

1182
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,080
That giant statue was sliced completely in half!

1183
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,640
Does that mean the top commander was done in?

1184
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,120
Royal Plateau

1185
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
Pica-sama's down!

1186
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,200
He's that strong, and yet he didn't enter the competition?

1187
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,880
What a humble guy.

1188
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,420
That power, yet he's merely Garp's grandson's subordinate?

1189
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,230
He's good!

1190
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,120
We managed to protect King Riku in the end, so I'll let it go. But still...

1191
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
The factory...!

1192
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,940
The factory that rose from the ground exploded!

1193
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,110
What's going on?!

1194
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,120
Inside the
SMILE factory

1195
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,860
One more time!

1196
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,560
Yeah!

1197
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,640
Heave-ho!

1198
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,850
Blow the factory to bits for making us suffer!

1199
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,880
We'll never be fooled or forced to work again!

1200
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,100
Hey, hey! Pica has been defeated and the factory just exploded, Doffy.

1201
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,710
But the defeated will be brought back. The factory will be restored.

1202
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,820
Celebrate while you can!

1203
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,540
We still have the Healing Fruit power user, Mansherry, on our side!

1204
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,670
Rebecca-sama!

1205
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,730
Robiland!

1206
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,100
Are you alright?

1207
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,110
The Fourth Level
Outside the Palace
The Sunflower Field

1208
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,660
Commander! You're Commander Kyros, right?

1209
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,800
Yup! I see you rescued the princess, Leo!

1210
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,560
You look so gallant! A spitting image of the statue!

1211
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,510
It's the other way around.

1212
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, you're badly injured.
I'll heal you right away.

1213
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,990
Actually, hold on.

1214
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,340
You must be Princess Mansherry.

1215
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,670
I heard a lot about your power,
but there must be some limit to it.

1216
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,120
Don't use it on me.

1217
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,920
But you're bleeding everywhere!

1218
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm fine. I'm still conscious.

1219
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,470
More importantly, I'm glad that you're okay. It must have been tough.

1220
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,180
If you're willing to use your power, there are people all over the country in need of it!

1221
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,390
What? This is...

1222
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,900
This is Dressrosa?

1223
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,060
Leo and the others explained the situation to me,

1224
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,920
but I didn't expect it to be this bad...

1225
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,700
Still, it looks like they succeeded in destroying the factory.

1226
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,590
The battle has come to a crucial point!

1227
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,390
This country was entrapped by Doflamingo.

1228
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,190
Whether we can return it to the hands of King Riku...

1229
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,560
or fall once again and become a land of despair...

1230
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,820
Our hope now rests with a certain band of pirates!

1231
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,370
Pirates?

1232
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,160
In the royal palace...

1233
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,280
On the top floor...

1234
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,600
Luffyland... Lawland...

1235
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,050
Those two are our last resort.

1236
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,760
Luffy... Traf-kun...

1237
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,220
Lucy...

1238
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,830
Beneath the Palace
Inside the Outer Wall Tower

1239
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,390
I've just entered the rampart tower.

1240
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,360
Looks like something bad's about to go down.

1241
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Sabo-kun, can't you get here? Where are you?

1242
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,050
I'm helping trapped prisoners escape from the Colosseum.

1243
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,380
You're too far away.

1244
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,960
You can handle pretty much anything on your own, right?

1245
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,480
If I thought I could handle this, I wouldn't be calling you! This might affect Luffy-kun!

1246
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,630
I'll be right there!

1247
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,150
Jeez!

1248
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,230
Former Royal Plateau

1249
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,360
Zoro! Do you need a hand?

1250
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,910
I'm okay! Ain't a scratch on me!

1251
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,250
Zoro, thank you! I thought I was done for!

1252
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,730
Zoro-dono, very well done!

1253
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,800
Pirate, thank you!

1254
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,440
When I saw you cut that giant statue with your swords, I could hardly believe my eyes!

1255
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,340
Hold it, you guys!

1256
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,780
Hold off on the excitement until that suffocating cage disappears!

1257
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,370
It's still there, which means the key man hasn't been defeated yet.

1258
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,760
Royal Palace

1259
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,250
First Floor

1260
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,030
Stop, Bellamy!

1261
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Stop!

1262
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,790
That bastard isn't worth risking your life for!

1263
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,980
That's for me to decide!

1264
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,100
Your body's in tatters already...

1265
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,180
If you keep fighting, you really will die!

1266
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,140
Even if I die, if I can take you down...

1267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,410
Doflamingo might at least remember me a little!

1268
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,630
He said he set you free, but...

1269
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,220
That's enough, Bellamy. I set you free.

1270
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,100
Like you have always been.

1271
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,270
...you didn't run, and now you're fighting me to the death...

1272
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,680
He must have known you'd do this.

1273
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm sure he did! But so what?!

1274
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,800
I respect him!

1275
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,880
If I can at least die in a way that would impress him...

1276
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,130
I'll be content!

1277
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,600
Don't lie! This is the only option you have left, right?!

1278
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
Because you're a man!

1279
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,990
If you understand that much, shut up and fight!

1280
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,440
But you'll die for nothing!

1281
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,460
No, this is what I want.

1282
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,740
If I'm to meet my end, it should be...

1283
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,260
by another man that I admire!

1284
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,680
Where are you going, Straw Hat?!

1285
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,420
The sky!

1286
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,120
What are you saying?! Bellamy has changed!

1287
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,000
You've changed, Bellamy.

1288
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,480
You're my friend!

1289
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,660
Thank you, Straw Hat!

1290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,230
Straw Hat!

1291
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,680
If you refuse to fight me...

1292
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,950
I'll just...

1293
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,910
kill you!

1294
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,790
Why're you just standing there?!
Put 'em up, coward!

1295
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,860
If you know how to throw a punch, that is!

1296
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,440
Die!

1297
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,520
So long, Straw Hat!

1298
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,520
Thank you for calling me your friend!

1299
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,960
I get it now!

1300
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,500
That I admired the wrong man!
And how pathetic I am!

1301
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,940
I know I'm an idiot...

1302
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,480
but even an idiot has principles he must stick to!

1303
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,140
Doflamingo!

1304
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,190
The beast is roaring.

1305
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,260
He should hurry on up here.

1306
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm sure he'll be surprised, Law...

1307
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,970
When he sees your dead body.

1308
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,360
A few minutes ago

1309
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,360
The Royal Palace

1310
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,550
{\an8}Sticky Launcher!

1311
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,350
He's still alive.

1312
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,980
Hey, hey, hey, Law.
Why don't you just accept defeat already?

1313
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,150
You really should rest, Law.

1314
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,180
You're not even a match for me on my own.

1315
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,000
Why would you want to challenge both of us at the same time?

1316
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,920
Straw Hat won't make it up here that easily.

1317
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,340
If he had the guts to kill his "friend" right off the bat,

1318
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,780
he might have been able to save you, but...

1319
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,090
He's such a naive idiot!

1320
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,650
Born in the hell that was White Town...

1321
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,490
Spending your entire childhood with no hope whatsoever for your future...

1322
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,950
But then you met my younger brother, Corazón.

1323
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,760
He extended your life expectancy,

1324
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,000
and you carried on resenting me, as if you were a ghost of him...

1325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,140
Living only for revenge, what an astounding obsession!

1326
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,940
However...

1327
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,680
it ends now.

1328
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,780
What a waste of thirteen years.

1329
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,560
I feel sorry for you.

1330
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,330
Your death is inevitable.

1331
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,110
You will die a completely meaningless death!

1332
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,630
But, if you're going to die anyway...

1333
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,020
Wouldn't you rather make something of it?

1334
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,170
I have an idea we'd both benefit from.

1335
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,510
I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully,
Trafalgar D. Water Law.

1336
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:25,060
Perform the ultimate Operation Fruit technique on me... the Eternal Youth Operation... and die.

1337
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,010
In exchange, I'll grant your wish, whatever it is.

1338
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,790
Whatever it is?

1339
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,000
If you really mean it...

1340
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,370
it's a brilliant idea. We'd both benefit from it.

1341
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,910
Alright, I'm in!

1342
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:53,170
You're a very understanding man! Doffy will finally have eternal life!

1343
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
Then...

1344
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,330
Bring Cora-san back to life, right now!

1345
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,270
When you're finished doing that,
go lick the asses of everyone in the country!

1346
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,720
"No match for" you?
"No use pinning my hopes"?

1347
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,770
Don't make me laugh!

1348
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,610
You're the one not seeing the whole picture, Doflamingo!

1349
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,760
The Straw Hats have caused all sorts of miracles in the past.

1350
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,160
You can't beat Straw Hatter!

1351
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,090
You won't be able to reclaim Caesar from him, either!

1352
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,220
Law, how dare you say that to Doffy!

1353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,760
It's your future that's hanging by a thread-

1354
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,470
The letters on your back, "Corazón"?

1355
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,930
Are you trying to mock me?

1356
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,830
And then there's the name of your crew, the "Heart Pirates"!

1357
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,640
Are you trying to mock me?!

1358
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,170
You won't even sit on the Seat of Hearts!

1359
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,640
So why do you bear the Heart crest?!

1360
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,010
Law!

1361
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,760
So irritating!

1362
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,160
Law, Corazón... This is it.

1363
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,160
There's no one left to carry on your ridiculous tenacity!

1364
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,380
The curse you've cast on me is broken!

1365
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,570
Present time

1366
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,570
Former Royal Plateau

1367
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,610
Straw Hat just took down Bellamy.

1368
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,150
That leaves two major enemies in the Donquixote Family.

1369
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,900
The only ones left are
the top commander and chief of staff, Trebol,

1370
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,330
and the Family boss, Donquixote Doflamingo!

1371
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,080
It can't be!

1372
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,460
What's the matter, Viola-sama?

1373
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,590
Viola?

1374
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,120
Our ranks have shrunk as well!

1375
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,360
"Our ranks"? You mean out of us was taken out?

1376
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,270
Trafalgar Law!

1377
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,420
Your majesty?

1378
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,510
In a situation where we can't let our guard down at any time,

1379
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,600
it's all the more important to keep our people out of harm's way.

1380
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,560
Yes, Sir! Let's go!

1381
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,520
M-Me, too!

1382
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,910
I'll go with you, too!

1383
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,650
Me, too!

1384
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,660
Alright! Let's go down to the city right now!

1385
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,780
It's not too late to minimize casualties!

1386
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Yeah! Even though we can't fight, there are still things we can do!

1387
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,680
Yeah! Let's go!

1388
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,290
Then, all that's left is...

1389
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,060
To put an end...

1390
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,840
to everything.

1391
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Doflamingo!

1392
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,150
You're late, Straw Hat.

1393
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,440
Now that I've emancipated him,

1394
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,240
Bellamy has become "free", right?

1395
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,300
Don't play dumb! You knew full well...

1396
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,320
that he wasn't gonna run away!

1397
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
Rubber...

1398
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,590
Elephant Gun!

1399
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,940
Spiderweb!

1400
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,980
I see. So Bellamy didn't run away.

1401
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,800
What's so funny?!

1402
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,900
Rubber...

1403
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,200
Hawk Gatling!

1404
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,350
Break White!

1405
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,740
That's dangerous!

1406
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,860
Hey, Traf!
Why're you bleeding so much?

1407
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,060
What happened to your arm?

1408
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,800
Hey!

1409
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Stay with me, Traf! Hey!

1410
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,290
Traf!

1411
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,550
He's dead. Obviously.

1412
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,590
That's not true!

1413
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,560
It is.

1414
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,390
He seemed to have a great deal of faith in you, too.

1415
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,190
He said you can work miracles.
Can you, Straw Hat?

1416
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,080
I didn't think you were that strong
when I fought you, though...

1417
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,990
Now, bring it on! There's only two of us left.

1418
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,990
How dare you bastards!

1419
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
Wait! Stay where you are!

1420
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,060
No way...

1421
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,460
The wall of strings...

1422
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,650
is shrinking!

1423
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,210
I'll have you follow Law in death shortly.

1424
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,460
Let's end this game, shall we?

1425
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,840
Mingo!

1426
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,800
Wait.

1427
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,480
Listen carefully, Straw Hatter.

1428
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,770
Look!

1429
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,460
It really is moving.

1430
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,220
The string wall's moving!

1431
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,650
Run for it!

1432
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Not even the outskirts of town are safe!

1433
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,060
Hurry up and make a break for it!

1434
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,570
Get to downtown!

1435
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,700
It's the same in the west!

1436
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,700
Reporting in! Eastern district, Carta!

1437
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,540
Per other reports, the bird cage appears to be shrinking!

1438
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,260
The islanders are all headed toward downtown!

1439
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,240
The Royal Palace

1440
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,220
Sooner or later...

1441
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,180
everyone dies, correct?

1442
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,820
Straw Hat, haven't you noticed?

1443
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,190
The rules of the game have changed.

1444
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,540
Game? What are you on about now?!

1445
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,920
Just listen.

1446
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,290
The bird cage that surrounds this town is shrinking, bit by bit.

1447
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,420
It's like an umbrella, slowly closing.

1448
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,220
It'll shred apart everything in this country.

1449
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,970
In about...

1450
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,640
an hour, give or take.

1451
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,690
There's nowhere to run.

1452
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,050
Save the people on the outskirts of the country, on the double!

1453
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,660
Aye!

1454
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,780
The weaker citizens have been evacuated
to the edges of the city, so hurry and get them!

1455
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,940
Run to the center part of town!

1456
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,670
Run! Here come the strings!

1457
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,240
Hey! Somebody, help me!

1458
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,300
Just freeing my legs would work!

1459
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,390
Untie me! I don't wanna die!

1460
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,100
T-T-The bird cage is shrinking?!

1461
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,790
Former Royal Grounds

1462
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,020
{\an8}What's going on?! The bird cage... The bird cage...

1463
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,270
Is this truly happening?

1464
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,140
My word...

1465
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,160
What do we do?! What can we do?!

1466
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,850
Hey, Zoro!

1467
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,950
The cage is heading toward us!  What's gonna happen to us?!

1468
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,540
We finally busted out from behind bars, only to be put behind them again?

1469
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,250
Where are we supposed to run?!

1470
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,780
How can he stoop so low?

1471
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,050
Are you not yet satisfied, Doflamingo?

1472
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,470
If the cage keeps shrinking like this...

1473
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,270
That's it for Dressrosa!

1474
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,290
The Royal Palace Grounds - Second Level

1475
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,350
What's all that smoke and rumbling?

1476
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,320
What in the world's going on?!

1477
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,700
Luffy, hurry up! Kick Doflamingo's ass already!

1478
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,910
You're our last hope!

1479
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,630
That is right! Indeed! Certainly!

1480
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,710
But that is too much to ask. The lives of everyone are in Luffy-dono's hands.

1481
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,770
We are counting on you, Luffy-dono!

1482
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,380
I am counting on you, too!

1483
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm not planning on sparing anyone.

1484
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:02,610
What advantage would I gain in allowing people
that have learned this country's secrets survive?

1485
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,870
Towns, people, animals...

1486
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,760
Even your allies...

1487
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,090
And you! Everyone dies!

1488
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:37,810
In other words, your friends just died
a little earlier than they otherwise would have.

1489
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,540
Right, Straw Hatter?

1490
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,880
Isn't that what he used to call you?

1491
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,410
Oh, you needn't worry.

1492
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,040
I'll build another country.

1493
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,450
Mingo, all I have to do to fix this
is kick your ass!

1494
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,460
I've been trying to tell you, you can't do that.

1495
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,270
You never learn!

1496
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,240
Bullet String!

1497
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,100
Rubber...

1498
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,640
Join Law in death!

1499
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,890
Chambres!

1500
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,690
Law!

1501
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,400
You're the one that's going to perish, Doflamingo!

1502
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,410
Do it!

1503
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,040
This operation will destroy you from the inside out!

1504
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,760
Gamma Knife!

1505
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,860
Doffy!

1506
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,660
Law! How are you still alive?!

1507
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,080
How are you using your Operation abilities without creating a Room?!

1508
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,460
No, this is a Room!

1509
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:26,800
It's at the cost of some of my lifespan,
but I created a Room so big you can't even see it!

1510
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,800
What?!

1511
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,740
I did it all for this moment... to set up this attack!

1512
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,220
He missed my vital organs!

1513
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,400
Chambres!

1514
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Mingo!

1515
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,760
Wait.

1516
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,180
I'm alive.

1517
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
Listen carefully, Straw Hatter.{end 721}

1518
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,460
Don't turn around. I have a plan.

1519
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,400
Nobody can defend against an attack from inside their body!

1520
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,290
Even you can't counteract this technique!

1521
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,850
Doffy, you're a king! Don't prostrate yourself!

1522
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,140
Now you've really done it!

1523
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,830
It's no use!

1524
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,320
Even if you kill me, it's too late for you!

1525
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,530
I won't let you live...

1526
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,490
Law!

1527
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,120
Rubber...

1528
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,130
Jet Stamp!

1529
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,800
Doffy!

1530
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,810
Doffy! Are you alright?

1531
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,170
You bastard!

1532
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,340
Wait, Straw Hatter!

1533
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,660
Traf...

1534
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,120
That bastard... is mine!

1535
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,480
Room!

1536
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,450
You're finished, Doflamingo!

1537
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,040
Law!

1538
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,840
Damn you! What have you done to Doffy?!

1539
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,560
Don't get in his way!

1540
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,020
You just...

1541
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,960
gathered people that were convenient to you
and called it a "family".

1542
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,840
And when your real brother, Cora-san, tried to end your rampage, you...

1543
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,400
He's free!

1544
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,890
Yeah, that was a shame...

1545
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,560
He betrayed me... even pointed a gun at me...

1546
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,610
But you knew!

1547
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,280
You knew Cora-san couldn't pull the trigger!

1548
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,600
I would have pulled it.

1549
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,090
I bet you would have.

1550
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,060
You're the same as me.

1551
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,460
I wanna destroy everything before my eyes!

1552
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,780
Towns, houses, people... I wanna destroy them all!

1553
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Yeah... That's fine by me.

1554
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,740
But on that day...

1555
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,960
You should have died, not him!

1556
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,460
Law, I'm sure you'll love to hear this...

1557
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,970
Corazón was a drag and an eyesore to me.

1558
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:19,770
He acquired this silly sense of justice
and wore that worthless heart of his on his sleeve.

1559
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,730
He was an incompetent man.

1560
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,320
When I killed him that day,
it was a huge load off my-

1561
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,530
Counter Shock!

1562
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,330
Go to hell you demonic bastard!

1563
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,630
Doffy!

1564
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,280
As expected of our king!

1565
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,020
H-How the hell...

1566
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:50,410
Given enough time, I can mend myself.

1567
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,650
As we speak, the strings within my body are repairing my internal organs.

1568
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,760
What?!

1569
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,940
It's all about how you use your ability.

1570
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,630
It's a bit different from recovery, though.

1571
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,050
Good job on the suicide attack.

1572
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,970
Sticky Chain!

1573
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,850
Stop!

1574
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,110
Sticky Stick!

1575
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,320
I'll put you out of your misery. It's the least I can do.

1576
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,750
Dammit!

1577
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,880
Dammit...

1578
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,000
