Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

Garp was a demon to us pirates back then.

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,500
It's been decades since then, but my wound still hasn't healed.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,650
Hey, is that true?!

47
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,660
No, no, no... I just misheard him! I'm Lucy!

48
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,600
I will make you to pay for what your grandfather did to me.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,490
Blame grandpa for that!

50
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,860
So you are Garp's grandson!

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,150
No, I'm not!

52
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,420
If you're the real Straw Hat Luffy,

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,970
I'm gonna cut you down here and now!

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,280
If I had found out about the existence of Garp's son Dragon sooner,

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,640
you would have never been born.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
Hey, what happened?!

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,610
Don Chinjao is going crazy!

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,600
That's not good!

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, wait a minute, pops!

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,100
Take that beard off!

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
Stop! No!

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,390
You've got to be kidding! Is he gonna attack again?!

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,150
I don't know how much weaker he's become since then,

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,200
but his bounty was over 500 million in his prime!

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,450
Damn you, Don Chinjao! Don't get in my way!

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,690
He's my prey!

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,980
Cavendish drew his sword!

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,010
Is that it?!

69
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,400
One of the world famous swords, Durandal!

70
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,860
Here we go!

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,700
Military Head!

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,820
Beautiful Sword!

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,700
Blue Bird!

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,470
It's piercing his head!

75
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,190
No, it isn't!

76
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,650
They're going at it!

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,650
I can't stab him with Durandal!

78
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,050
A head that can't be stabbed by a sword, and the power to push back a giant!

79
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,710
These guys aren't human!

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,220
I can't take him down while holding back!

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,580
You bastard!

82
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,040
I told you to knock it off!

83
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,590
He knocked down Chinjao!

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,420
Who is that little bearded guy?!

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,820
Oh my...

86
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,640
Wow! It didn't phase him!

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,730
Could the legend be true?

88
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,960
They say he broke up the
Ice Continent with a head-butt!

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,600
The Ice Continent?!

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,870
It didn't work at all. I thought I used enough strength.

91
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,630
Oh my...

92
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,920
It seems like the two of you are quite strong!

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,820
But you still need more training!

94
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,360
It's true. That strength... There is no mistaking that you're Straw Hat.

95
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,830
What do you want from me? Leave me alone!

96
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,980
Stealing others' popularity,

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,120
and being born as the grandson of a demon,

98
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,270
you really incur everybody's hatred.

99
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,070
Neither of those things are my fault!

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,610
I'm Lucy, by the way.

101
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,410
If you keep interfering, I'm gonna kill you too, young knight!

102
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,040
Wait, old man! That's enough!

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,230
If you cause trouble here, they'll disqualify you!

104
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,630
It's Sai and Boo from the Flower Country.

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,670
Let go of me, my dear grandsons!

106
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,590
No! I don't know what's going on, but you have to stop!

107
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,690
I finally found it! A way to settle the duel with Garp!

108
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,090
If we get disqualified here,

109
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,930
we can't achieve what we came here for, Grandpa!

110
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,340
Hey, you guys! What's going on over there?!

111
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,910
We'll have to ask you to leave if you're fighting outside of the ring!

112
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,310
Guards, huh?

113
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,440
I don't care if I get disqualified here or not!

114
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm going to...

115
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,520
Where did he go?!

116
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,810
Old man, if it's about the guy with the fake beard,

117
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,330
he's in C Block with us!

118
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,530
If you wanna kill him, do it in the ring!

119
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,700
You're not getting away, Straw Hat!

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,670
I'll take your life before the match starts!

121
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,610
What a mess. What was that all about?

122
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,420
I heard the word "Straw Hat".

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,830
If you heard "Straw Hat" they were probably talking about the pirate, Straw Hat Luffy.

124
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,390
Do you think he entered this competition?

125
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,360
No way!

126
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
Boy...

127
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,180
I promised Franky that I wouldn't let anybody know who I am!

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,400
I-I can't believe it! Tank was beaten!

129
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,250
The captain of Dressrosa's Self-Defense Army, Tank Lepanto was eliminated!

130
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,310
He fell prey to the evil duo, Abdullah and Jet!

131
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,360
They keep using dirty tricks!

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,190
Captain Tank!

133
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,620
Over 100 competitors have been eliminated,

134
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,280
and there are only 30 some men left in the ring!

135
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,300
It won't be much longer.

136
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,070
It doesn't matter how tough the remaining one will be as long as we have the King Punch...

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,610
Who's next?!

138
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,650
If you want to bleed, come out!

139
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,090
Tank Lepanto was taken out

140
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,020
by the evil combination of Abdullah and Jeet.

141
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,100
Bellamy!

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
"Atrocious"! "Evil"!

143
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,780
Those are the only words fitting to this man!

144
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,500
In the meantime, the Jiaokungdo martial artist, Blue Gilly

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,680
and the mysterious gladiator, Ricky

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
are fighting each other with all they have!

147
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,040
That Fish-Man is so strong!

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,530
He's been knocking out all of his opponents with a single blow!

149
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,190
That's so cool!

150
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,450
I'm so excited!

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Stop him!

152
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,080
Unbelievable!

153
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,990
How much more does Bartolomeo want to offend these people?!

154
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,790
Why is nobody kicking his ass?!

155
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,460
In front of this huge audience,

156
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,170
he pulled it out and started peeing!

157
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,370
No one has ever done such a thing in this Colosseum!

158
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,140
It feels so good!

159
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,980
Somebody, stop him!

160
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
Here comes that somebody!

161
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,830
Some of us are taking this thing seriously, brat!

162
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,810
What?

163
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,110
You'll have to excuse me for attacking you from behind!

164
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,290
Hey, wait! I'm defenseless!

165
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,930
The hero who came in to punish him is the Fish-Man warrior, Hack!

166
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,940
Four Thousand Tile...

167
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,980
Do it! Kick his ass, Hack!

168
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,950
Punch!

169
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,710
Psyche!

170
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,250
What did he do?! Hack is the one on the ground?

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,990
What's going on?!

172
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,360
What was that?

173
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,050
W-Who the hell are you?!

174
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,860
Bartolomeo!

175
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,940
Hack was defeated!

176
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,020
He was beaten without even landing a punch!

177
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,140
What did Bartolomeo do to him?!

178
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,940
Damn! I was rooting for Hack! That bird brain!

179
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,900
Gatz-san, you're supposed to be unbiased!

180
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,070
There is still no clear winner!

181
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,370
24 competitors remain in B Block.

182
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,870
It's winding down, huh?

183
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,340
Such cheek...

184
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,170
Almost everybody has wounds of some kind!

185
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,670
It's about time!

186
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,810
Powerful competitors are getting eliminated too, one after another!

187
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,800
Following Hack, the unknown gladiator, Ricky, has also got taken down!

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,960
Blue Gilly is strong!

189
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,540
Blue Gilly-sama!

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,550
What do you think you're going to cut with that sword, old man?

191
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,890
I guess you can't fight against age.

192
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,890
I can't stand all this cheering.

193
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,330
I can't stand you, Doflamingo!

194
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,570
There aren't that many men left thanks to Dagama's tactics!

195
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,790
When Dagama gives us the cue, we'll disband.

196
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,240
Then we'll fight amongst ourselves until one of us wins.

197
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,900
Men! Take care of Blue Gilly while we're fighting together!

198
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,890
Okay!

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,500
Dagama?!

200
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,470
You did a fine job, you stupid dogs!

201
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,370
Why?

202
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,240
Hey, you haven't given us the cue!

203
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,150
Don't tell me... Dagama!

204
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,090
You two!

205
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,350
Sorry! I've been told to hunt you dogs!

206
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,440
Were you plotting together...

207
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,230
To get rid of us from the beginning?

208
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,640
I will pay you later! Your job is done now!

209
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,950
Dagama!

210
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,660
Warriors who can't use their brains just end up as pawns on a battlefield!

211
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,680
I'll be counting on you, Longleg man!

212
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,020
Now that you turned your back to me, you're dead too.

213
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,880
Blue Gilly.

214
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,960
What?!

215
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,020
You betrayed me, Blue Gilly!

216
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,490
Dagama the tactician was eliminated!

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,800
Way to go, Longleg guy!

218
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,590
Blue Gilly-sama!

219
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,390
I can't believe people would trust a
dubious guy like him in the first place.

220
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,120
What's this? Meanwhile, on the other side...

221
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,910
Bellamy went in for the attack but ended up on the ground!

222
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,570
What did Bartolomeo do?!

223
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,440
I-I can't believe it!

224
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,520
Our Bellamy is barely breathing!

225
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,120
What devil fruit did he eat?!

226
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,030
Bellamy...

227
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,570
It's just like with Hack! Bellamy took damage from his own attack!

228
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,070
What did he do to him?

229
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,530
Hey, Bellamy! Don't give up!

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,970
Now what are you gonna do, Elizabello?

231
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,510
Nothing is more helpless than a king without his court.

232
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,220
Everyone's dying to take your head.

233
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,440
Dagama did a great job.

234
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,840
The time has come.

235
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,900
All that is left is to throw it!

236
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,680
You guys are the ones who were protected while we were in that battle formation.

237
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,840
Because nothing is more dangerous than an exposed blade.

238
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,710
Isn't that right, punk?

239
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,460
Hey, I just thought of something.

240
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,100
What?

241
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,300
There was a report about the king of Prodence.

242
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,310
They said he destroyed an enemy country's fort with a single punch.

243
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,710
No way! He must've used some kind of weapon.

244
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,560
No, they say it could even take out one of the Four Emperors.

245
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,170
What?

246
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,720
If that's true, everything in front of him,

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,820
including these seats will get destroyed!

248
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
What?!

249
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,110
No way! That can't be true!

250
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,880
I've heard those reports too!

251
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,290
No! He wouldn't throw such a dangerous thing at a place like this!

252
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
There is a restlessness in the air!

253
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,000
The king who kept quiet in the battle formation is now on the move!

254
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,310
We of the Prodence Kingdom will be taking the Flame Fruit!

255
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,330
I've got a terrible feeling about this!

256
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,180
You've got to be kidding!

257
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,090
Whoa-whoa, this is bad!

258
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,020
Run!

259
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,360
Maybe he really did destroy the fort!

260
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,270
You're so persistent! What are you doing?! Get off me!

261
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,290
No way! Don't underestimate the power of my spring!

262
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,470
King...

263
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm gonna kill Elizabello!

264
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,390
Outta my way!

265
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,510
Shooting...

266
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,240
Punch!

267
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,500
How...

268
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,660
How powerful was that?!

269
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,400
I don't think anyone in the ring could have survived!

270
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,100
That was a hell of a punch!

271
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,600
I've never seen anything like that before!

272
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,880
Bellamy! Blue Gilly!

273
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,180
And all other potential winners have been eliminated!

274
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,280
The winner of the B Block battle royale, against 138 contestants,

275
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,310
came from the Prodence Kingdom...

276
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,150
Hey, look! Somebody's there!

277
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,160
You see? Right over there!

278
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,840
The audience in that direction didn't get blown away

279
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,390
because he defended it!

280
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
Barrier!

281
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,070
People can create barriers by crossing their fingers.

282
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,670
Even kids know that!

283
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,710
I ate the Barrier Fruit and became a barrier man.

284
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,170
Barrier Crash!

285
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,710
"The Fighting King", Elizabello II has been knocked out!

286
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,680
The winner of B Block is...

287
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
Dammit!

288
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,120
...Bartolomeo!

289
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,540
Every one of you can go to hell!

290
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,230
Go away!

291
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,170
Screw you!

292
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,020
What? That strange guy won.

293
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,890
I will take the Flame Fruit to that person for sure!

294
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,920
Inside the Colosseum
Passages to the Audience Seating

295
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,130
{\an8}Then, you, too?!

296
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,510
{\an8}Shh! Shh!

297
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,670
{\an8}Not so loud!

298
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,750
You're plotting to destroy the factory too?!

299
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,520
Indeed! My friends and I have been carrying out preparations for it!

300
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,970
Tell me where it is! I'll destroy it right away!

301
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,920
You can't do that!

302
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,990
Because we want to save the workers in the factory!

303
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,400
Our plan is a big project that could lead to the fall of this country!

304
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,120
If you have the nerve and are determined to go against Doflamingo,

305
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,830
I'm going to tell you everything about this tragic kingdom of Dressrosa!
