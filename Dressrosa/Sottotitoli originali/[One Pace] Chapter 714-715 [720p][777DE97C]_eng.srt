The bond that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll find One Piece...

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,100
and become the Pirate King!

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,430
Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,250
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,350

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,950
W-Who are you?!

49
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,280
Be quiet!

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,490
Did you just call me a mermaid?

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,550
We didn't say that!

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,480
Boy, if she keeps using that weird power, the Sunny will get all messed up!

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,700
Putting aside Franky-san's anger, can we even turn it back?

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,530
The room that used to be the men's dormitory...

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,510
I don't know.

56
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,370
Anyway, we can't let Sunny get screwed up anymore!

57
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,010
I hope she throws her attacks this way.

58
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,140
Away from the ship.

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,780
Huh?

60
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,170
Hey, guys!

61
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,890
Just go and take Momonosuke away from them!

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,070
Yes, Jora-sama!

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,560
My soul is swinging! My mind is full of images!

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,920
My mind is going to erupt!

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,370
Oh, she's going to do it again!

66
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,390
Oh! Hello?! We're here!

67
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,930
Aim it over here!

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,660
Don't bother with the ship! We're over here!

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh, it's going to explode! An image of liberty and beauty!

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,550
No!

71
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,560
The world should be free!

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,920
Shouldn't it?!

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Damn!

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,080
She did it! We're in big trouble!

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,230
This is what beauty is!

76
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,130
Oh no! It's not even a ship anymore!

77
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,750
Oh boy, oh boy!

78
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,140
I'm not going to fall for your trick!

79
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,410
Young Master-sama ordered me to kidnap Momonosuke and hijack your ship!

80
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:07,700
Indeed, now there is no way for you
Straw Hats to escape from Dressrosa! {Halee: Shall we remove the comma?}

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,480
Dressrosa

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,490
{\an8}I don't need any medical attention!

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,340
Corrida Colosseum

84
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,340
{\an8}I'm leaving!

85
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,540
Mr. Ricky! We can't just let you go!

86
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,410
We are supposed to care for all of the competitors, including treating their injuries.

87
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,050
It's our job.

88
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,570
You let people kill each other in front of an audience!

89
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,900
Cut the "treatment" crap!

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,480
Your head wound hasn't stopped bleeding!

91
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,940
Take off your mask and let us take a look!

92
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,790
Don't touch my mask!

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,210
Open the exit!

94
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,930
Everybody, hold him down. He's badly wounded!

95
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,470
That's a serious wound.

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,210
You should let them treat you.

97
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,580
Here.

98
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,170
Move! I can walk by myself!

99
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,950
Go straight and take the stairs to the basement.

100
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,310
Rebecca... I'm sorry.

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,320
Inside the Colosseum
Donquixote Family waiting room

102
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,010
{\an8}Straw Hat is participating in the tournament, Diamante.

103
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,250
After the match works fine.

104
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,150
Joker wants me to kill Straw Hat?

105
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,760
Doffy's too indulgent.

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,530
He's giving the man who couldn't win the tournament one more chance.

107
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,380
Aren't you happy, Bellamy?
Assassination is an easy task.

108
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,420
Finish it up before the competition's over.

109
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,870
Hey, Bellamy! Hang in there!

110
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,660
After that you will get an
executive position in the Family.

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,810
I heard you're trying to kill Lucy, Cavendish.

112
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,820
Bartolomeo, huh? Congrats on making it to the final.

113
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,170
My matter with Lucy is none of your concern.

114
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,770
No, that man is...

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,470
not yours to kill!

116
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,880
I see. You too, huh.

117
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,340
Because he's in the limelight!

118
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,980
But he is my prey.

119
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
My connection with him is much deeper.

120
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,770
Many people have been eliminated already!

121
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,000
The battle for Block C is heating up!

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,140
But even though they're all tough fighters, there is one giant warrior who is literally sticking out!

123
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,350
He is a warrior of the new generation from the famous giants' country Elbaf!

124
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,510
The strongest "Pirate Mercenary"!

125
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,140
His name is...

126
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,390
Hajrudin!

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,360
He's gigantic!

128
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,570
Have you ever seen a giant with a logia power?

129
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,130
That's what I'll become with the Flame Fruit!

130
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm going to become the king of...

131
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,720
all giants!

132
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,210
With just a single blow! It was like lightning!

133
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,960
Who can possibly stop him?!

134
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,210
Whoa, and meanwhile...

135
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,680
there is a fighting bull running out of control,
showing no fear for all those tough contenders!

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,160
He's a killer bull who slayed 21 death row prisoners during a fight in this very Colosseum!

137
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,820
The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

138
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,100
People call him Brutal Bull, the extraordinary cow!

139
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,860
And somehow, someone has managed to tame this grim reaper!

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,710
Bursting into prominence, with his cool strength, he has instantly became a crowd favorite! {Halee: Remove the first comma?}

141
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,100
Lucy!

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,130
Forward, Ucy!

143
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,620
I like that guy, too!

144
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,010
Gatz-san, you should be unbiased!

145
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,480
Good boy! Go, go! Take them all down!

146
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,980
Lucy!

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,570
Even hiding his face, he becomes popular! Straw Hat!

148
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,590
What a funny guy.

149
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,240
Go Ucy!

150
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,740
Oh no, they've challenged Hajrudin!

151
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,890
Do you wanna fight me?

152
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,780
Oh, crap! Run, Ucy!

153
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,850
Ucy!

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Bull!

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,830
Bull!

156
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,300
Lucy!

157
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,050
That was fast!

158
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,350
The difference in power was evident!

159
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,090
In front of the rookie from Elbaf...

160
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,950
the Colosseum's Grim Reaper and the unknown gladiator, Lucy, were...

161
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,190
G-Gatz-san!

162
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,900
didn't stand a chance...

163
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,970
Huh?

164
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,170
The giant has been knocked down!

165
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,690
That was awesome, Lucy!

166
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,890
You can't help getting more excited as we go on!

167
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,300
He came in and stirred things up in Block C!

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,900
Lucy did it again!

169
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,070
Let me carry you to the side of the ring, Ucy.

170
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,660
I believe this man still has a lot more to show!

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
It was obvious.

172
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm astonished... I didn't expect him to be that strong.

173
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,720
Lucy!

174
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,070
Hey, hey, giant man. This is a ring.

175
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,070
If you wanna take a nap, find a bed!

176
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,730
Hajrudin's enormous body was blown away by an explosion?!

177
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,990
What just happened?!

178
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,330
No, it wasn't an explosion!

179
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,910
Hajrudin got eliminated, but
Block C still has many strong fighters!

180
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,750
It was a punch that looked like an explosion, powered by those odd-shaped shoulders!

181
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,480
Ideo!

182
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,850
{\an8}The one who blew away the Giant's huge body was...

183
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:05,070
XXX Rank Boxer
Destruction Cannon Ideo

184
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,070
{\an8}the two-time champion of the
New World Central Fighting Tournament!

185
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,290
Destruction Cannon Ideo!

186
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,600
However, that's not the only fight you want to keep an eye on! {This line makes no sense in context - Galaxy}{Hajrudin vs. Ideo fight, even tho it's over they had their eyes on it - Sewil}

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,570
Now, take a look!

188
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:24,080
The gang of three from the Flower Country in the far east are very unique, too!

189
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,190
It's no use!

190
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,080
{\an8}There you go!

191
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,480
{\an8}You can't protect yourself from it!

192
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,530
Flower Country Gang Member
 13th Commander of the Happou Navy - Sai

193
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,350
{\an8}Allowing him to manipulate the impact, The Eight-Impact Fist,

194
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,530
{\an8}Shields and armor are useless against them!

195
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,340
{\an8}With centuries of history, the Happou Navy is...

196
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,900
Flower Country Gang Member
Vice Commander of the Happou Navy - Boo

197
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,900
{\an8}just unbeatable!

198
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,420
If we are able to kill you,{Halee: Not very natural English, how about "If we kill you..."}{Sewil: Changed it}

199
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,790
it's going to be almost as big as winning the prize of this competition, Chinjao!{Halee: Continuing from the first line, how about "it'd be something almost as big as winning the prize of this competition, Chinjao!"}

200
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,760
Boy...

201
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,000
Flower Country Gang
12th Commander of the Happou Navy (Retired)

202
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,160
Go home and train yourselves more before coming back, punks!

203
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,350
Don Chinjao

204
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
That was Conqueror's Haki!

205
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
No wonder.

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,890
He used to be a legendary pirate worth 500 million!

207
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,190
There is only one man that I want to fight, don't get in my way!

208
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,300
Thank you, Chinjao!
There are so many nice weapons to choose from now!

209
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,240
Whoa!

210
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,110
That man didn't get beaten by Don Chinjao's Haki

211
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,420
{\an8}And he's picking up weapons in the ring!

212
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,010
Bounty Hunter - Jean Ango
Jean the Bandit

213
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,010
{\an8}He is a dark horse in this competition, Jean the Bandit!

214
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,200
A bounty hunter that all big-time pirates in the New World hold a grudge against!

215
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,320
Wait, you shithead!

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,730
Now that I found you, your time is up!

217
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,080
I won't forgive you for sending my partner to prison!

218
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,880
My bullets are weapons I've picked up.

219
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,570
I'm a sniper!

220
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,300
If that partner guy was so important to you,

221
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,740
you should've shown spirit like you were raiding a prison! {Halee: Sounds weird in English, how about "you should have fought like you were raiding a prison!"}

222
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,660
There was an idiot like that two years ago.

223
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
Hey! That guy has already passed out!

224
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,990
How long will he keep punching him?!

225
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,860
Hey, stop, brother! He's already knocked out!

226
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,000
That's enough!

227
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,960
I restrained the wrong person.

228
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,270
This bastard! He called me shrimp!

229
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,360
{\an8}Hey, Bobby, am I a shrimp?! Huh?!

230
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,070
From the Mogaro Kingdom
Assassins - The Funk Brothers

231
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,750
{\an8}No, you're not! You're a big man!

232
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
Say something, you octopus!

233
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,510
Brother! That's enough!

234
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,250
I restrained the wrong person.

235
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,880
{\an8}If I ever hear you say it again, I'll gouge your eyes out!

236
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,870
Older Brother
Kelly Funk

237
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,970
{\an8}Don't keep trying to stop me, Bobby!

238
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,740
Younger Brother
Bobby

239
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,740
{\an8}But this is a competition, brother.

240
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,670
The Funk Brothers are so brutal!

241
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,510
They're assassins who are well known in the underground community!

242
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,090
I heard they're very powerful fighters and they've even
killed some pirates worth over 100 million!

243
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,760
I don't care if it's a competition or not! I'm not short!

244
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,760
These guys are annoying.

245
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,660
He's just an untrained amateur boxer.

246
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,590
Let's see what you've got!

247
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,100
Hey, shrimp!

248
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,410
Brother!

249
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,560
What?!

250
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,010
How weak!

251
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,460
I mean, maybe the Happou Navy people are too strong!

252
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,640
What a disappointment!

253
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,830
You're not a powerful fighter at all, you idiot! You fool!

254
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,160
Gatz-san!

255
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,460
You're next, younger brother!

256
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,910
Wait! I won't fight.

257
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,550
I've never gotten into a fight in my entire life!

258
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,200
Go to hell!

259
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,210
He turned his back?! These brothers are the worst!

260
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,650
The axe broke!

261
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,620
The axe was even infused with Armament Haki!

262
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,540
How tough is his body?!

263
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,780
Brother.

264
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,730
T-That bastard called me a shrimp.

265
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,330
Just put it on already, Bobby!

266
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,160
What's going on?!

267
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,730
Boo!

268
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,210
Boo from the Flower Country is taking quite a beating!

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,200
He's already passed out!

270
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,730
Who's punching him?!
Is that the wimpy younger brother Bobby?!

271
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,080
Or the weak older brother Kelly?!

272
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,380
I guess that's the older one!

273
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,240
He got bigger and looks like a different man!

274
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,710
Who did you call shrimp? Try saying it this time,

275
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,250
I will chew a hole in your throat!

276
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,990
Wow! Lucy's helmet got knocked off!

277
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,660
Hey, give it back!

278
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,090
I heard this strange story, Lucy.

279
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,800
I heard a pirate who's worth 400 million named Straw Hat Luffy is...

280
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,430
secretly fighting in this competition.

281
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,560
Don Chinjao is charging at something!

282
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,550
Garp, watch me!

283
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,980
I'm going to kill your grandson!

284
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,360
Block C! There are approximately 40 contenders remaining!

285
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,890
It's narrowing down to the strongest!

286
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,330
Who's going to be the winner?!
