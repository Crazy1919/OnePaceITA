00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,880
Since always.

1165
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,300
So you've been... fooling Doflamingo all this time?!

1166
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,850
I never claimed that I'd become a mute.
He just assumed so.

1167
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,780
That's the same as fooling him!

1168
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,960
What are you thinking?!

1169
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,550
Hey now...

1170
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,740
Silent!

1171
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
Huh? Huh?

1172
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,620
The noise in the streets is gone!

1173
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,770
Why?!

1174
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,870
I can see people talking, but I can't hear anything!

1175
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,750
I put up a wall because you were being noisy.

1176
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,440
Huh?

1177
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,660
A sound-proof wall.

1178
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,040
You can't hear sound from out there, right?

1179
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,380
They can't hear us, either.

1180
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,420
I ate the Calm Fruit. I'm a soundless man.

1181
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,160
A Devil Fruit user?!

1182
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,310
What the hell?! Everything about you is a lie!

1183
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,760
So does that mean? Your idiotic clumsiness...

1184
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,770
Yeah, of course.

1185
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,490
It's all acting.

1186
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,240
Don't lie! Your shoulder's on fire!

1187
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,980
I've always been clumsy.
There's nothing for it, I'm just a klutz.

1188
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,520
Shut up! The most unbelievable part about you is the only thing that's real?!

1189
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,160
Why are you hiding all this from your friends?!

1190
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,090
I don't consider them my friends.

1191
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,300
What I'm trying to do is stop my big brother Doffy from going out of control.

1192
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,200
I don't know how that beast was born from our warm-hearted parents.

1193
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
He's... inhuman.

1194
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,800
Help!

1195
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,280
My children have done nothing wrong!

1196
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,800
Aim your arrows at me instead!

1197
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,340
Please! Don't harm my children!

1198
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,240
It hurts, Father! I can't take it anymore!

1199
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,930
I'll get even with you bastards!

1200
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Brother...

1201
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,300
I won't die!

1202
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm gonna survive, no matter what you do to me, and I will...

1203
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,940
I will come back and murder every single one of you jerks!

1204
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,280
He's evil by nature, and he doesn't fear anything.

1205
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,980
The only people who know how brutal Doffy truly is...

1206
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,040
are the four commanders, including myself,

1207
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,260
and Vergo, the previous Corazón.

1208
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,310
Vergo?

1209
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,690
A strong member of the Family, who's currently working alone on a secret mission of some sort.

1210
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,420
The details of the mission were kept secret from even the Family.

1211
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,750
He has nothing to do with you.

1212
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,540
Don't become a beast like my brother!

1213
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Get outta here, Law!

1214
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,240
No way! I want to be like that!

1215
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,760
The secret name "D"...  It's no mistake.

1216
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,240
You're a part of that fated family — the Family of D.

1217
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,390
Back in my homeland, children are disciplined with stories...

1218
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,660
"A misbehaving child will be eaten up by D."

1219
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,920
People with the name "D" often end up becoming infamous.

1220
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,100
Old people will frown and mutter...

1221
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,070
"D is sure to cause another storm."

1222
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,590
What are you saying?! Am I some kind of monster?

1223
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,680
Maybe.

1224
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,360
Nobody knows the real reason behind it,

1225
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,740
but that name has been ceaselessly and secretly inherited throughout history all across the world.

1226
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,280
And in a certain land, there are people who call the Family of "D"...

1227
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,650
"The sworn enemy of the gods"!

1228
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,660
Gods?!

1229
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,110
Assuming that "gods" refers to the Celestial Dragons,

1230
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,300
your family's goal might be the destruction of this world.

1231
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,440
But it's an entirely different kind of destruction from what Doffy wants.

1232
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,140
Ds must have an ideal opposed to that of the gods.

1233
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,390
I don't know what you're talking about!

1234
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,780
I joined the Family to kill every single person as violently as possible!

1235
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,620
I'm not your subordinate!
I'm Doflamingo's subordinate!

1236
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,420
I'm gonna die in a year!
What am I to do if I get out of here?!

1237
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,570
Get out of here and look for a cure!

1238
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,560
There is none!

1239
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm gonna tell Doflamingo that you can talk,
and about your ability and everything!

1240
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,940
Don't do it!

1241
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,130
You've got much worse than banishment coming!

1242
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,100
Damn brat!

1243
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,170
I've become stronger in the last two years!

1244
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,460
Serves you right!

1245
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,790
Hey, Law! You broke the blood law again!

1246
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,460
Hey, I saw your mouths moving... What were you doing?

1247
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,780
I'll buy you an ice cream, so keep quiet.

1248
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,970
I want the king size that costs 500 belly-dasuyan!

1249
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,740
Baby 5, lend me some money.

1250
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
What?!

1251
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,720
O-Okay!

1252
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,320
Blush! He needs me!

1253
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
Is this it?!

1254
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,000
Dammit!

1255
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,380
I trusted that little brat and told him everything!

1256
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,290
Corazón!

1257
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,880
We gotta set sail! It's Tsuru from Navy HQ again!

1258
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,860
The Navy has found us!

1259
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,380
He... hasn't told him yet?

1260
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,860
I decided not to tell him.

1261
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,300
I realized...

1262
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,960
I owe you for keeping quiet about me stabbing you two years ago.

1263
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,080
We're even now.

1264
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,850
{\an8}Sail: Tsuru

1265
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,030
Where are Corazón and Law?

1266
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,960
I saw them on board. Aren't they here?

1267
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,940
Young master! I found this in Corazón's hammock.

1268
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,560
I've  left  to

1269
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,560
cure Law's disease

1270
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,770
They packed their things and left, it seems.

1271
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,880
What is he thinking?!

1272
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,080
This is kidnapping!

1273
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,820
Hey, pick up the Snail Phone!

1274
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,940
Isn't it Doflamingo?! I'll talk!

1275
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,510
Pick it up!

1276
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,630
I said pick it up! Pick it up!

1277
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,840
Doflamingo! Help!

1278
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
What are you gonna do to me?!

1279
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,460
Hey!

1280
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,030
Are you calling Doflamingo?!

1281
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,400
Hey! Help me!

1282
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,960
"Rice-cracker pellets".
It's me.

1283
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,220
Oh, Rosinante?

1284
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,890
I'm taking leave from my mission for a while.

1285
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,420
{\an8}Sign: Navy

1286
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,170
REIGNING JUSTICE

1287
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,520
Are you in trouble?

1288
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,970
No, it's personal.

1289
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,180
Okay, got it.

1290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,810
How are the kids?

1291
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,180
Are they still there despite you giving them a hard time?

1292
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,150
I don't think those three will leave...

1293
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,820
The Family's become quite infamous now. Be careful.

1294
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,520
Yes, Sir.

1295
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,540
Navy HQ
Admiral Sengoku

1296
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,240
I entrust this case to you, so do as you wish.

1297
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,770
Keep me updated.

1298
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,940
Roger that. I'll send you the details in writing.

1299
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,690
Commander
Donquixote Rosinante

1300
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,720
Admiral Sengoku!

1301
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,000
Buddha

1302
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,140
The man requesting transfer, who I mentioned the other day, is here.

1303
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,180
Alright. Come in.

1304
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,660
So it's you.

1305
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,390
I've been hearing about you.

1306
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,500
I hear you've done a lot of important work in the past year since you officially joined.

1307
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,410
So you want to transfer to G-5, huh?

1308
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,700
First of all, I want to ask you about the sunny-side up egg on your left cheek...

1309
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,940
Yes, Sir! My name is Vergo, Sir!

1310
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,810
Where were you calling just now?!

1311
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,460
You said "mission"! Are you a marine or something?!

1312
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,020
You don't like marines?

1313
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,560
People tied to the Government make me sick!

1314
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm not a marine.

1315
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,280
Really?!

1316
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,620
Hey! I don't wanna go to the hospital!

1317
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,260
Stop acting like some normal kid!

1318
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm gonna cure your disease!

1319
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm gonna take you to every single hospital!

1320
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,400
Look! It's a big hospital! I'm sure they can cure you!

1321
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,640
Wh... White Lead Disease?!

1322
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,210
It's been around for a while now.
Don't you have a good medicine for it, Doc?

1323
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,800
E-E-Excuse me, but where are you from?

1324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,580
Flevance.

1325
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,300
The White Town!

1326
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,240
No! I'm gonna get infected!

1327
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,650
H-Hey! Bring me antiseptic and gloves and a gas mask now!

1328
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,090
And call security and the Government! Hurry up!

1329
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,480
N-no! Nooo!

1330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
Forget it!

1331
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,980
No! No! No! No!

1332
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,080
Law!

1333
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,620
Nooo!

1334
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,960
See?! I'm not even a human anymore!

1335
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,690
White monster! Please leave! I beg you!

1336
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,380
Hey, you! How dare you bring a kid like that here?!

1337
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,080
Do you realize how many patients we have?!

1338
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,130
{\an8}This is an emergency announcement.

1339
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,370
{\an8}We have a child with White Lead Disease in the hospital.

1340
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,460
That big guy's violent!

1341
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,500
{\an8}We are now sterilizing the entire building.

1342
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,080
That was the worst hospital ever!

1343
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,110
My bad. That must have brought back painful memories.

1344
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,640
I told you so! I don't wanna go to a hospital!

1345
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,010
That one was terrible...

1346
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,790
But I'm sure there'll be a good doctor in the next one!

1347
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,140
I don't wanna go!

1348
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,330
White Lead Disease! No! Somebody, help!

1349
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,460
It's a survivor from the White Town!

1350
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,450
Let's go to the next! You'll get cured in the next one!

1351
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,400
Enough! I don't wanna go!

1352
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,150
Hello?! World Government?!

1353
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,830
We have a survivor from Flevance here!

1354
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,500
Why didn't you kill all of them?!

1355
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,880
Look, Law! People in this town look kind!

1356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,840
No!

1357
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,960
Ugh! I'm gonna get infected! Go away!

1358
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,080
How dare you call yourself a doctor?!

1359
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,440
{\an8}Eight hospitals were damaged.

1360
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,740
Which way did those two go?!

1361
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,630
{\an8}The boy with the disease is...

1362
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,390
Corazón, I'm not getting better at all...
You're just making it worse for me!

1363
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,220
Stop whining! You'll get cured in the next one!

1364
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,870
It's either find the cure or death!  Your life is on the line now!

1365
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,060
Stay strong!

1366
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,840
White Lead Disease!

1367
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,030
Close the hospital! They're gonna come in!

1368
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,060
I'm gonna kill all y'all!

1369
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,470
No, Corazón!

1370
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,860
Corazón!

1371
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,350
Six months later

1372
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,790
What am I doing?

1373
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,850
I've been making the kid from that tragic town relive the tragedy over and over...

1374
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,820
And he hasn't gotten any better...

1375
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,660
Am I doing it for "D"?

1376
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,610
No... I don't care about that anymore.

1377
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,510
I just... I just feel real bad for him...

1378
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,450
I'm sure you don't want...

1379
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,840
this idiot who just keeps hurting you...

1380
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,610
to say something like this but...

1381
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,280
You're still a rude little boy...

1382
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,730
and hearing you say "I'll die soon" is...

1383
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,270
heartbreaking.

1384
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,440
You... stabbed me... that day, but...

1385
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,560
it didn't hurt at all!

1386
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,640
I know you were the one who was in pain!

1387
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,810
You poor thing!

1388
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,950
Law!

1389
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,480
Cora-san...

1390
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,170
Hey, Cora-san!

1391
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,220
What's wrong with your face?!

1392
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,560
You just called me Cora-san...

1393
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
Shut up! Just pick up the Snail Phone!

1394
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,190
It's me, Corazón.

1395
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,360
Corazón, you're there, aren't you?

1396
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,760
It's been six months since you two left.

1397
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,670
Is Law with you?

1398
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,740
Doflamingo!

1399
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,430
I see. I'm glad both of you are fine.

1400
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,500
Have you found a good doctor?

1401
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,340
I thought not.

1402
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,100
Bring Law back to the ship.

1403
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,570
We might be able to cure the disease.

1404
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,800
I received information about the Operation Fruit.

1405
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,580
The Navy offered a huge sum of cash in a trade with some pirates...

1406
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,950
who are too stupid to know its real value, it seems.

1407
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,100
The Government must be pulling strings behind the scenes.

1408
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,360
It's risky, but we'll seize it.

1409
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,250
Due to the nature of its power, once we have it...

1410
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,670
the person I trust the most should eat it.

1411
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,680
You eat it, Corazón.

1412
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,250
And cure Law's disease.

1413
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,690
What do you guys think?

1414
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,090
Even including Tsuru who often smelled us out,

1415
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,730
found us, and came after us,

1416
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,030
the Navy hasn't showed their face at all in the past six months.

1417
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,870
The same six months that Corazón has been away.

1418
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,710
Are you saying that he was tipping the Navy off before?

1419
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,710
It could be just a coincidence.

1420
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,700
I hope so. I don't want to distrust him...

1421
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,210
He's my brother, after all.

1422
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,030
Good news! Law!

1423
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,820
You have a chance to survive! Forget about the doctors!

1424
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,440
If we can get the Operation Fruit, we'd be able to cure your White Lead Disease!

1425
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,270
What's the Operation Fruit?

1426
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,880
It gives you the ability to modify human bodies!

1427
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,110
You can perform miraculous operations and cure unknown diseases with it!

1428
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,650
What? Sounds like magic.

1429
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,020
Yes! But it's not magic! You need medical knowledge!

1430
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,300
I know that you're the son of a doctor who was trusted by the people of Flevance!

1431
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,730
So, it's perfect for you!

1432
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,970
Me?! Doflamingo said you should eat it!

1433
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,860
A person will die if he eats two Devil Fruits.

1434
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,100
Doffy said that because he doesn't know that I'm a Devil Fruit user.

1435
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Neither of us is ever going back to the Family!

1436
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,970
I decided that after realizing that this journey would be a long one.

1437
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,910
Doffy probably knows that I'm a traitor by now.

1438
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,880
But he didn't seem suspicious. He said you should eat it...

1439
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,720
There is another reason for Doffy to say he wants me to eat the Operation Fruit!

1440
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,920
Doffy...

1441
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Because I'm loyal,

1442
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,290
you're looking to have eternal life in exchange for my life, aren't you?

1443
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,810
I'll be killed if I go back!

1444
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,240
Listen, we'll get a jump on Doffy and the others and steal the Operation Fruit!

1445
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,860
You eat the Fruit!

1446
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,140
Once you're cured, we'll run away somewhere!

1447
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,780
Prepare to set sail!
We'll get the Operation Fruit at any cost!

1448
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,830
"Rice crackers"!

1449
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,320
"Rice-cracker pellets". It's me.

1450
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,730
Rosinante! It's been a while. I've been worried about you!

1451
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,530
Hey, Garp! Get out for a bit!

1452
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,710
What?! I just brought you crackers!
Put some tea on for me!

1453
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,400
Vice Admiral Garp...

1454
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,110
Should I call you later instead, Sengoku-san?

1455
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,380
Get out! Idiot! I gotta work! W-O-R-K!

1456
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,280
Oh, Kuzan!
Do you wanna snack on some crackers with me?

1457
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,840
Um... Can I talk?

1458
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,920
Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

1459
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,560
Is it true that you've made a deal for the Operation Fruit?

1460
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,560
H-How did you know?!

1461
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,670
My brother has found out.

1462
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,370
What?! But it's top secret!

1463
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,270
Cora-san must be talking to...

1464
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,580
I wanna know those pirates' activities.

1465
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,350
I don't think we can find them before the trade...

1466
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,650
Even if Doflamingo is looking to steal the Operation Fruit before the trade?

1467
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,150
He is?!

1468
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,780
Oh? Hm?

1469
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,520
I feel kind of dizzy...

1470
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,700
When and where will the trade be?

1471
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,600
Three weeks from now, at Rubeck in North Blue.

1472
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,100
Rubeck...

1473
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,180
Doffy wants me to meet up with him and the others at
Swallow Island three days before the trade.

1474
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,880
Three days before, huh?

1475
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,980
So I guess all of the Family members will be there, ready for battle.

1476
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,950
That's a good tip.

1477
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,950
That'll be it for Doflamingo!
We'll wait for him at Swallow Island

1478
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,580
and ambush him, catching the entire Donquixote Family in one fell swoop!

1479
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,030
You stay away from the island!

1480
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,320
I was planning on it.

1481
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,830
The list of all Doffy's business partners and the big shots connected with him behind the scenes...

1482
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,270
I'll give it to you sometime soon.

1483
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,840
I think it'll be more than enough for you to uncover the dark side of the North Blue.

1484
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,750
Okay. Thank you.

1485
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,190
Hey, Law. Are you ready?

1486
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,320
We gotta sail out...

1487
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,420
Law!

1488
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,240
Hey! Wait! You gotta be kidding! Stay with me!

1489
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,000
Not now! We finally have a chance!

1490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,210
It's not been three years yet!

1491
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,540
I thought you still had time left according to your calculation!

1492
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,610
Oh no! He has a very high fever! What should I do?!

1493
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,110
Doctors are all useless!

1494
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,260
Dammit! What am I supposed to do?! Tell me, Law!

1495
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,750
Please make it!

1496
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,860
Stay alive for another three weeks!

1497
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,980
Give me a chance!

1498
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:11,370
Three days before the trade

1499
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,980
Dammit! Why does it have to be so choppy now?!

1500
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,890
Cora-san...

1501
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,370
Huh? What's wrong, Law?!

1502
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,070
The Government knew that we would die...

1503
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,210
But they kept making us dig up White Lead, for money!

1504
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,880
My family... and the people of Flevance...

1505
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,250
The Government killed them!

1506
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,040
So if you're a marine allied with them,

1507
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,830
tell me the truth.

1508
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,370
That's absurd! I'm not a marine!

1509
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,440
Good!

1510
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,110
In fact... You need to realize...

1511
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,710
Stealing the Operation Fruit means...

1512
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,560
we'll make enemies of everybody...
Doflamingo, the Navy, and the Government!

1513
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,260
We'll be chased by all of them!

1514
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,600
You better be prepared to fight for survival!

1515
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,550
Minion Island

1516
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,500
Have you found the pirates, Sengoku-san?

1517
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,570
Yeah. East of Rubeck where we're making the deal...

1518
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,470
Minion Island's there, with a ghost town.

1519
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,110
Looks like that's where their hideout is.

1520
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,480
The pirate's name is Diez Barrels. Sound familiar?

1521
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,230
Yeah, he's a former Navy officer...

1522
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,640
That's right.

1523
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,690
Our scout-ship is staking out Minion Island now.

1524
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,230
Meanwhile, at Swallow Island where you and Doflamingo were going to meet up,

1525
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,570
there are two warships.

1526
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,770
I won't let Doflamingo steal the Operation Fruit!

1527
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,440
Law, it won't be long. Wait here...

1528
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,730
Dray! Booze! Bring more booze!

1529
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,440
Right away.

1530
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,800
How much do you think this one fruit would cost?

1531
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,100
They offered five billion!

1532
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,280
How ridiculous! Did the Government go nuts?!

1533
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,620
Once we got that much money, there's no reason for us to be pirates!

1534
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,420
Right, right!

1535
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,780
It may sound too simple but...

1536
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,390
once a doctor eats this,

1537
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,300
they'll become a famous doctor in great demand all over the world.

1538
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,200
There was a legendary doctor who ate this and cured intractable or rare diseases...

1539
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,140
by performing miraculous operations, they say.

1540
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,190
But it has nothing to do with us!

1541
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,050
Yeah, getting money is way better!

1542
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,720
That's right!

1543
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,530
Look at this, Law!

1544
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,870
This trick makes everything I touch completely soundless!

1545
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,940
Calm!

1546
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,770
{\an8}Silence!

1547
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
That face...

1548
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,320
{\an8}Silence!

1549
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,780
{\an8}Silence!

1550
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,450
Stinks!

1551
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,820
See? You heard nothing, right?!

1552
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,760
What is that ability good for?!

1553
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,060
It's not even cool!

1554
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,560
Baby 5's Weapon Fruit is much better than that!

1555
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,100
D-Damn! You're right! I wish I had that power!

1556
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,700
But no one can have a peaceful rest like me...

1557
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,960
Whatever!

1558
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,190
What was that quake?!

1559
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,490
Captain! Th-There wasn't any noise but the compound's exploded!

1560
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,440
What?! That can't be happening!

1561
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,210
The treasury is on fire!

1562
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,780
Put out the fire now!

1563
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,980
What's going on?!

1564
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,120
Is there an invader?!

1565
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,140
The lights went out!

1566
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,590
Pieces of glass are falling onto us!

1567
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,220
The lamps! The lamps are broken!

1568
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,120
Somebody! Somebody put on a light...

1569
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,030
Hurry up and put on a light!

1570
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,220
{\an8}Silence!

1571
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,230
I got it, Law!  It's the Operation Fruit!

1572
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,100
Your disease will be cured!

1573
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,890
Who's this?! He scared me!

1574
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,980
Where did he tumble down from?

1575
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,850
Hey! A guy in a dark coat stole the Operation Fruit!

1576
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,490
Don't let him get away!

1577
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,420
It's him!

1578
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,740
I know it's hard but... wait here for a while.

1579
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,040
I'll be back in no time.

1580
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,080
With the Operation Fruit!

1581
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,000
