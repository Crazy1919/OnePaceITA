00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,010
Boy from the White Town
Trafalgar Law
(Age 10)

1165
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,950
Throw him out!

1166
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,940
Hey, hey, Law!

1167
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,720
It's been a week already.

1168
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Don't you wanna run away?

1169
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,500
You've been getting beaten by Corazón ever since you came here.

1170
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,480
Kids and adults alike run away.

1171
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,270
That's why we have only the strongest.

1172
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,240
How much longer will a useless brat like you last?

1173
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,460
No matter what happens, don't forget the blood law.

1174
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,450
The Family will fall apart if a member defies a commander's authority.

1175
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,720
I once laughed at Pica-sama
and almost died from the torture.

1176
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,940
It doesn't scare me.

1177
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,350
I've seen hell itself.

1178
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,700
Donquixote Pirates
Captain
Donquixote Doflamingo

1179
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,060
You're free to say what you want...

1180
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,350
But Corazón is my precious younger brother of my own blood.

1181
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,470
If anyone so much as nicks him, I'll...

1182
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,420
put them to death!

1183
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,790
Look at his skin!

1184
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,830
The White Lead Disease!
It's agonizing pain if you're infected!

1185
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,740
What?! It's contagious?! That's gross!

1186
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,620
Get out of here now-dasuyan!

1187
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Giolla, don't treat mere rumors as fact.

1188
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,770
Shame on you.

1189
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,380
Look, Buffalo believed you.

1190
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,940
The White Lead Disease is a poison.

1191
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,770
It's not contagious.

1192
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,940
But stay away from me just in case-dasuyan!

1193
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,790
I don't wanna catch that disease-dasuyan!

1194
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,610
Hey.

1195
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Are there any other survivors from the White Town, Flevance?

1196
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,460
I don't know.

1197
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,520
It took everything I had just to escape.

1198
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,570
How did you get out?

1199
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,940
I crossed the border by hiding under a pile of dead bodies.

1200
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,680
Hey! I'm eating!

1201
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,120
Why so much malice?

1202
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,350
I don't believe in anything anymore.

1203
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,150
I'm not afraid of death.

1204
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,800
Corazón!

1205
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't push your luck!

1206
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,900
I'll get my revenge on you at any cost!

1207
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,070
Hey, are you stupid?
Weren't you listening?!

1208
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,700
They'll torture you if you do that!

1209
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,050
Impalement!

1210
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,160
Don't mess with pirates!

1211
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,020
Children are idiots. They think crying and saying sorry will make things better!

1212
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,850
Port Town Rakesh

1213
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,350
Hey, what kind of place is the White Town, where that kid was from?

1214
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,690
It was a country called Flevance.
The White Town was a nickname for it.

1215
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,180
Flevance?

1216
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah.

1217
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,100
All of its citizens were rich, and the towns were all white, from the soil to the plants...

1218
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,150
Like winter in a fairy tale.

1219
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,530
I heard the country's beauty was out of this world.

1220
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,610
One day, they discovered White Lead, a type of lead, underground...

1221
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,260
And found out that was the source of the fantastic scenery.

1222
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,920
They made utensils, paint, sweeteners, cosmetics, and even weapons out of White Lead.

1223
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,340
People all over the world wanted to buy their high-quality White Lead goods...

1224
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,740
And it became Flevance's flagship industry.

1225
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,400
The cunning World Government went into the transport business to ship that merchandise.

1226
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,660
White Lead made people a fortune.

1227
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,980
Law, for this kind of surgery, you use that blood vessel.

1228
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,610
Oh really?

1229
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,080
Big brother! Let's go to the festival!

1230
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,660
Yeah. Why don't you three go?

1231
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,910
All right, but just for half an hour.

1232
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,590
We have so many patients to take care of.

1233
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah!

1234
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,370
Law! Let's go! To the festival!

1235
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
Yeah!

1236
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,040
The White Town was the place everyone longed for.

1237
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,050
Oh, I wanna go there!

1238
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,580
"G", for longed!

1239
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,550
But it's gone now.

1240
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,460
What?

1241
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,780
About a century ago, when the White Lead industry was established...

1242
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,180
The World Government performed a geological survey in the country...

1243
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,500
And so they already knew the truth.

1244
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,380
The truth?

1245
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,740
It was poison.

1246
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,700
What?

1247
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,020
Poison that wasn't harmful unless you dig it up.

1248
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,820
But if you handle it, it'll decay your body.

1249
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,950
What?!

1250
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,580
Knowing this, but blinded by the easy fortune to be had,

1251
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,630
the Government and the royalty of that country kept it secret.

1252
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,930
Their citizens kept mining it, knowing nothing.

1253
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,140
But that means they would die.

1254
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,960
Yeah.

1255
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,280
The terrible part was it only contained traces of poison.

1256
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,310
Say that the Lead keeps building up in a young person's body.

1257
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,260
When they have a child, they will actually have a shorter life expectancy.

1258
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,460
Then when the kid grows up and has their own child...

1259
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,640
That child's life expectancy is even shorter.

1260
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,470
Age
10

1261
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
Age 30

1262
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
Age 50

1263
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
Age 70

1264
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
Life Expectancy

1265
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
The negative effect






on future generations

1266
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,470
No more
descendants

1267
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,200
Life expectancy grew shorter, generation by generation,

1268
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Age
10

1269
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Age 30

1270
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Age 50

1271
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Age 70

1272
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Life Expectancy

1273
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
The negative effect






on future generations

1274
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,630
No more
descendants

1275
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,680
until eventually a generation doomed to die before adulthood, just like Law, was born.

1276
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,300
When the world finally realized that White Lead was poisonous...

1277
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,770
It was too late.

1278
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,890
At some point, people started to collapse one after another.

1279
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,580
Grandparents, parents, and then children.

1280
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,780
Because of the differences in their life expectancies, all generations fell ill around the same time.

1281
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Their skin and hair rapidly whitened.

1282
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,440
People died one after another, their entire bodies racked with pain.

1283
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,170
No doctor could stop it.

1284
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,920
Then, all the people in his country died?!

1285
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,100
Poor them...

1286
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,400
The real tragedy began after that.

1287
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,240
Huh?

1288
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Seeing the people in the White Town all dying with the same symptoms,

1289
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,320
people in neighboring countries thought White Lead Disease was contagious.

1290
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,630
White Town

1291
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:48,510
So they formed a blockade around the country and took quarantine measures against the White Town.

1292
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,740
The royal family got help from the Government and escaped the country at an early stage.

1293
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,510
They abandoned their subjects.

1294
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,260
People from the White Town who were looking to be treated and immigrate to other countries

1295
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,780
were feared like wild beasts escaping from their cage, and they were shot dead.

1296
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,350
They swept the whole situation under the rug.

1297
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,670
Dammit!

1298
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,840
The suffering the disease caused was just somebody else's problem.

1299
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,580
It was a natural human reaction.

1300
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,310
But Flevance couldn't keep quiet.

1301
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,600
Ironically, they had tons of lead bullets.

1302
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Eventually, a war broke out.

1303
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,170
Other countries justified their actions as self defense, so they showed no mercy.

1304
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,130
I'm sure you can imagine the rest.

1305
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,970
Law-kun!

1306
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,350
Come, you must leave with us.

1307
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,010
There are gentle soldiers who told us they will let only the children escape!

1308
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,870
Law!

1309
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,020
We'll be safe!

1310
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,200
Sister! My little sister is dying!

1311
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,300
I can't go now!

1312
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,660
Lammy-chan?!

1313
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,490
I see...

1314
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,530
Then, let's ask them to get you on board the next refugee ship!

1315
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,460
I'll come back to pick you up!

1316
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,590
Law! Aren't you coming?!

1317
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,260
Let's escape together!

1318
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,590
I'm sure they'll save Lammy later, too!

1319
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,280
Both my mom and dad are dead!

1320
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,380
But they told me to live!

1321
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,220
So I'm gonna live no matter what!

1322
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,520
Listen, Law-kun.

1323
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,520
There is always hope.

1324
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,300
A merciful helping hand will...

1325
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,980
always reach out to you, like this.

1326
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,540
Doctor, help!

1327
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,440
Doctor!

1328
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,340
It's impossible! I can't go there!

1329
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,810
We don't have enough doctors!
Same for blood and everything!

1330
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,230
There must be a way to clear away White Lead from bodies!

1331
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,650
And it's not contagious!

1332
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,180
Why doesn't the Government report that?!

1333
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,450
Big brother, my body hurts.

1334
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,660
My skin's getting whiter and whiter...

1335
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Hang on for a little more.

1336
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,700
Our father is the greatest doctor in the country.

1337
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,370
He'll cure you!

1338
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,990
Why is it so noisy outside?

1339
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,350
There's a festival!
Flevance is always booming.

1340
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Get well soon and let's go to a festival together again!

1341
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,380
Uh-huh!

1342
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,670
Lammy, stay in here for a few minutes.

1343
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,480
Uh-huh...

1344
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,580
Two infected people have been terminated!

1345
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,680
Law!

1346
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,850
Law! Let's go! To the festival!

1347
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,480
Mother!

1348
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,560
Father!

1349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,430
Listen, Law-kun. {cp 701}

1350
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,320
There is always hope.

1351
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,320
A merciful helping hand will...

1352
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,390
always reach out to you, like this.

1353
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,330
Sister!

1354
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,470
Everybody!

1355
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,220
Let's escape together!

1356
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,560
So I'm gonna live no matter what!

1357
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
The hospital...!

1358
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,280
Lammy!

1359
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Flevance, the White Town, perished.

1360
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,100
In the end, it was done by humans.

1361
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,400
If a ten-year-old kid went through such an ordeal...

1362
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,580
There's no way it wouldn't screw up his personality.

1363
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,080
There he is! Corazón!

1364
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,990
My parents, my sister, and everyone from the church are all dead...

1365
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,900
Yet that idiot is alive! It's not fair!

1366
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,210
They won't know if I keep quiet.

1367
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,130
Nobody will notice...

1368
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,020
If a scumbag goes missing!

1369
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,150
Damn! I was seen!

1370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,440
He... b-broke the... blood law!

1371
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,540
He deserves impalement-dasuyan!

1372
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,840
I must inform the young master-dasuyan!

1373
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,530
They're a family of Celestial Dragons!

1374
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,740
Kill them!

1375
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,750
They're former Celestial Dragons.

1376
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,680
The Navy won't interfere, even if we kill them.

1377
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,550
The admirals won't come, either!

1378
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,210
I'm so glad I got a chance for revenge!

1379
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,620
I thought I'd have to bear it silently all my life!

1380
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,980
Break all their bones with a hammer!

1381
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,240
Shoot them with a thousand arrows!

1382
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,860
No! Don't let them die so easily!

1383
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,700
Keep them alive and let them suffer long and well!

1384
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,530
Listen, you fiends!

1385
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,680
My sons were only five and two years old...

1386
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,540
And all they did was cut across the path of the Celestial Dragons...

1387
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,350
For something so small...

1388
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,030
They were killed!

1389
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,020
My enslaved daughter came home looking like she'd been through hell,

1390
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,760
and she killed herself, without a word, three days later!

1391
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,080
I was once your slave! And my eyes...

1392
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,180
Because of you... Because of you...

1393
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,270
Give me back my wife!

1394
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,530
You guys don't give a damn about our lives!

1395
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,720
Because of the Heavenly Tribute we pay to you fools,

1396
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,240
my country was destroyed by famine!

1397
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,280
Have you ever been hungry?!

1398
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,350
Everyone became skin and bones, and died!

1399
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,850
So you guys are gods, huh?!

1400
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,890
You're different from humans, right?

1401
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,090
Then, I bet this won't kill you!

1402
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,620
Doffy!

1403
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,400
Brother!

1404
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,060
Dammit!

1405
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,660
H-How dare you...

1406
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,730
Treat us humans worse than worms!

1407
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,520
Do you know what it's like to be in pain, grief, agony?!

1408
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,920
Well, Celestial Dragons?!

1409
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,220
What is it?

1410
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,250
The Holy Land Mariejoa, 33 years ago

1411
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,480
Are you insane, Saint Homing?!

1412
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,530
You, of all people?!

1413
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,300
You're saying you renounce your status as a god and reduce yourself to a mere human?!

1414
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,600
World Noble (Celestial Dragon)
Saint Donquixote Homing

1415
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,600
I am human, and I have always been.

1416
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,480
Do you imply we are too?!

1417
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,760
That's sacrilege!

1418
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,940
Who do you think we Celestial Dragons are?!

1419
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,040
Traitor! You have always been heretical!

1420
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,810
He's right, traitor!

1421
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,460
So savage!

1422
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
Get out of Mariejoa now!

1423
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,380
We cannot take you farther than here.

1424
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,050
We're at the north end.

1425
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,160
A non-member nation of the World Government.

1426
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,150
Some assets and an adequate house are ready for you there.

1427
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,320
Thank you. That's all we need.

1428
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,540
Now, I'll collect your Celestial Dragon ID chips.

1429
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,610
Let's live a humble life here, all four of us as a family.

1430
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,350
Father! Where are the slaves?

1431
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,510
If there aren't any, let's go buy some.

1432
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,360
Doffy. Rosinante.

1433
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,380
We have to teach you from scratch.

1434
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,810
Doffy, we are going to live as humans from now on.

1435
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,070
Humans?

1436
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,070
We'll lead a life far richer than the life in Mariejoa.

1437
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,170
Not "rich" in the sense that we'll have money and possessions.

1438
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,940
I mean spiritually.

1439
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,480
Hey!

1440
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,900
Why don't you kneel before us?!

1441
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,630
You fools are disrespectful!

1442
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,720
You just cut across in front of me, didn't you?

1443
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,820
Somebody, fetch me a pistol!

1444
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,460
Who do you think I am?!

1445
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,550
Where are the Celestial Dragons?!

1446
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,810
Find them!

1447
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,180
Hang them up!

1448
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,320
Father, why don't they kneel before us?

1449
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,430
They're not in here!  They must've run!

1450
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,070
Find them! They can't have gone far!

1451
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,020
Don't kill them! Keep them alive, and let them suffer!

1452
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,420
Yeah!

1453
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,640
We will take revenge on that family for centuries of injustice!

1454
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,820
Yeah!

1455
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,930
Doffy!

1456
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,100
Father! Why do they come after us?!

1457
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,290
We should be thankful to be out of the rain here at least.

1458
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,210
People around here haven't heard about us yet.

1459
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,480
How can I live in such a filthy place?!

1460
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,750
There are bugs inside the house! The smell here makes me sick!

1461
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,150
Find the family!

1462
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,820
They should still be around here!

1463
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
Kill them as soon as you find them!

1464
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,380
We must run! Now!

1465
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I never imagined it would turn out this bad.

1466
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,220
I was too optimistic. Please! I'll do anything!

1467
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,400
Would you please let us go back to Mariejoa? At least take back my wife and children!

1468
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,230
If we stay here, we'll be killed!

1469
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,910
That was your own choosing.

1470
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,660
You cannot take back what you gave up.

1471
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,830
Don't ever call me again!
You're no more than a human!

1472
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,170
You bread thieves!

1473
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,120
Father! For the first time in my life...

1474
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,930
I feel pain!

1475
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,900
Father!

1476
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,450
For the first time in my life, I'm hungry!

1477
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,400
Eat fast, Rosy!

1478
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,580
Somebody's gonna come!

1479
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Mother, we brought you some food.

1480
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,150
Doffy. Rosy.

1481
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,280
Mother!

1482
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm sorry... I don't...

1483
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,410
feel very well...

1484
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,830
Father...

1485
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,300
Mother is dead!

1486
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,600
We got them!

1487
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,570
Please, you can have me, but let my children go!

1488
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,820
Please! I'm begging you!

1489
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,290
Father!

1490
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,050
Damn you!

1491
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,080
Look at what you've done!

1492
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,580
Young master, we've caught Law!

1493
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,560
Looks like he was thinking of escaping.

1494
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,510
Dammit! Let go of me!

1495
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,160
He was already at the port-in.

1496
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,560
They'll start torturing him for stabbing Cora-san-dasuyan!

1497
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,660
I feel so sorry for Law...

1498
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,590
Corazón!

1499
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,220
Damn! He didn't die!

1500
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm gonna get done in for nothing?!

1501
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,880
I shut Buffalo's mouth by buying him an ice cream...

1502
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,840
But that guy told him himself!

1503
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm sure the blade went through his body!

1504
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
How can he act like he's fine?!

1505
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,440
Law...

1506
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,790
I called you in for just one thing.

1507
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,280
I've decided to make you an official member of the Donquixote Family.

1508
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,350
The Family-in!

1509
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,160
Because you went through such a horrible experience,

1510
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,190
you developed that incomparable, hateful look in your eyes.

1511
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,970
You have what it takes.

1512
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,570
He sees potential in your future!

1513
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,440
The young master is a visionary.

1514
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,540
Doesn't he know what I did to Corazón yet?

1515
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,860
Why? He can tell him in writing.

1516
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,440
What is he up to?

1517
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,720
Even if he sees potential in me, I'll die in three years anyway!

1518
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,300
That depends on your luck!

1519
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,970
Luck?

1520
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,500
We deal mainly in the black market.

1521
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,120
We handle Devil Fruits, as well.

1522
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Some Devil Fruits give powers that defy common sense.

1523
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,750
There might be a Fruit that could cure your disease.

1524
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,320
Devil Fruits?

1525
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,560
If you're lucky,

1526
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,080
your life could be saved by a Devil Fruit we come across in the three years you have left.

1527
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,400
I will train you to become my right-hand man ten years from now.

1528
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,510
What's wrong?

1529
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,840
An
enemy

1530
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,210
You were attacked?

1531
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,010
Did you take care of him?

1532
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,150
I got
rid of
him

1533
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,760
That's good, then. Now go have your wounds treated.

1534
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,140
Did he just... cover up for me?

1535
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,070
What is he playing at?!

1536
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,720
We'll keep moving our base of operations toward Reverse Mountain in the southeast...

1537
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,780
and expand our business.

1538
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,940
2 years later

1539
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,940
2 years later

1540
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,040
We told you our real names!

1541
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,040
So what? I'm not interested!

1542
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,680
You're so uncool! No fun!

1543
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,460
Fun or not, I'll die anyway.

1544
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,930
You have quite a lot of white parts now.

1545
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,520
I don't know if I'll survive another year.

1546
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,540
I may die sooner than I calculated.

1547
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,670
That aside, if you have a real name, tell us-dasuyan!

1548
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,180
Or I'll tell the young master you stabbed Cora-san two years ago!

1549
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,520
Trafalgar D. Water Law.

1550
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,860
I'm supposed to keep that name secret.

1551
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,490
But since I don't go by a code name like you two, it doesn't really matter.

1552
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,100
"D." is a secret name, and "Water" is taboo...

1553
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,660
For generations, my family-

1554
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,160
What a boring name.

1555
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,240
Yeah-dasuyan.

1556
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,810
You're the ones who kept nagging me about it!

1557
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,780
Hey, let go of me!

1558
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,120
What the... Corazón! What do you want?! Hey!

1559
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,060
Oh, he's gonna get beaten again.

1560
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,190
Cora-san looked scarier than usual.

1561
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,630
What do you want, Corazón?! Do you wanna fight?!

1562
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,840
Was that true, what you just said?

1563
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,450
Eh?

1564
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,970
Huh? What? Who's there?!

1565
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,670
The secret name "D."...

1566
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,760
If it's true, you need to get out of here.

1567
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,580
Get away from Doffy!

1568
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,580
Law! You have to stay far away from him!

1569
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,400
