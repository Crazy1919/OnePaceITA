Keep pushing forward!

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070

A chain of excitements!

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,230
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,700
and head for your goal, that's what adventure is all about!

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Let's go shining! Running! Forever!

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Spread open the chart of your dreams!

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,170
There's power hidden in the bond between us,

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,360
T-T-They've all assembled!

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,910
The participants in the Colosseum's final match have finally assembled! {Cecil: I'm sick of him saying Corrida Colosseum instead of just the colosseum, it awkwardizes the line.}

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,550
The four block winners and Mr. Diamante.

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,550
Donquixote Family Top Commander
Diamante ♦

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,490
The prize that will be given to one of these winners is...

34
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,190
Considered one of the strongest Devil Fruits, the Logia type Flame Fruit!

35
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:54,190
Diamante and Pica

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
It's gonna be mine.

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,250
If he's not Lucy, then who is he?

38
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,040
Don't start the match!

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,760
Remove Rebecca from the ring!

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,810
Block D needs a redo!

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,550
It seems there's some trouble.

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,680
As if we'll accept that ridiculous result, Rebecca!

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,440
There's no way we'd lose to a brat like you!

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,960
We'll finish the match right now!

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,890
That's right, kill her!

46
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,500
Hey, get out of the way.

47
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,740
What a bunch of sore losers.

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,970
What's done is done.{Isis: I'm not really sure about this line tbh, isn't it usually "What has happened, has happened."?}

49
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,280
Don't mess with my performance!

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,610
What are you up to?!

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,250
Now, aim carefully.

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,210
You think we're bulls?!

53
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,480
Don't underestimate us!

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,620
It may be flapping in the wind, but this cape is made of steel.

55
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm a Flag man who ate the Ripple Fruit.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,350
I can turn my body and everything I touch into fluttering material.

57
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,240
Lock!

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,680
Corrida Glaive!

59
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,400
It would be best if you retreated now.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,570
We've let loose some Fighting Fish that are suitable for the finals.

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,840
They're very sensitive to the smell of blood.

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,110
It's fly-

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,420
Did you guys see that?

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,880
That Fighting Fish's charge?{Isis: I added the(?) mark here cuz I think it's a continuation of the previous line}

65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,600
They're heinous animals that will attack even the participants in the ring.

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
They've got the most twisted personalities.

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,800
They're on a completely different level to the Fighting Fish in the preliminary rounds.

68
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,400
The bosses of each school of Flying Fish!

69
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,640
And on the back of just one of them, this tournament's prize,

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,050
the Flame Fruit is tied to it!

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,700
The rules of the finals are simple.

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,360
The last one standing, who manages to steal the Fruit, wins!

73
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,570
Now, the final battle,{Isis: split the line here to make it more presentable}

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,240
a battle royale of five people, including our hero Diamante, is about to begin!

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,140
A scramble for the Devil Fruit!

76
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
A death match with the Fighting Fish!

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,780
Who will win the Flame Fruit?!{"Whose hands will grab..." struck me as being way too literal. -Starfish}

78
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,010
Now,

79
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,150
for...

80
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,590
the starting gong! {Cecil: I'm too tired to split this now -_-}{Isis: I did some splitting and retiming here, if it's not to your liking, feel free to do whatever you see fit. well, this is what you get for being a lazy senpai anyway :D}

81
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,550
We're finally here.

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,470
The Royal Palace Lower Section
In front of the Rampart Tower

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,470
Is that the entrance to the palace?

84
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,970
That's just the palace's lower column.

85
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,610
The entrance to the rampart tower.

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,770
There's a secret entrance to the Rampart Tower as well. Let's go that way.

87
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,720
Be careful not to get discovered by the guards.

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,400
If we make a fuss and the commanders find out, we won't be able to move freely.

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,340
Especially if we're found by Pica, we'll never reach Doflamingo.

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,070
Hm? Where's Luffy-dono?

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,130
Um... there!

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,810
Rubber...

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,180
What the hell is that carp?!

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,990
Giant...

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
What's with this carp?!

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,750
Is it a pufferfish?

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,610
Pistol!

98
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,670
What the hell are you doing?!

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,930
It's open.

100
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,680
Don't give me that!

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,450
No way.

102
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,580
You dunce!

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,360
No choice.

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,900
Let's go, at this point, it's faster to go through the front gate.

105
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,820
Can I take this off already?

106
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,190
Do whatever you want!

107
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,490
Now, now...

108
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,630
That's...

109
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,640
This is a report from the entrance of the Rampart Tower!

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,930
There's an intruder. It's Straw Hat Luffy!

111
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,050
The Fighting Fish attacks, but Lucy dodges it effortlessly!

112
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,510
What great movement!

113
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,600
What are they on about?

114
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,620
Is he really the intruder?

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,080
It's true.

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,390
He destroyed the gate.

117
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,650
But it can't be him.

118
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,860
Straw Hat is fighting in the Colosseum under the name Lucy right now.

119
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,890
This is Rampart Tower B-2, in front of the dining hall!

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,050
There's no doubt about it, the intruders are Straw Hat Luffy,

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,810
the Pirate Hunter, Zoro,

122
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,450
and V-Violet-sama!

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,120
Then who the hell is the guy in the colosseum right now?!

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,160
Just what is going on?!

125
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,040
Palace

126
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,040
Commerce Port

127
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,040
Lift between the
Commerce Port and Palace
Currently moving up

128
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,990
Doflamingo Family
(♦Diamante Army)
Lao G

129
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,850
Captain!

130
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,750
Damn you!

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,030
Kabu-san!

132
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
What just happened?

133
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,030
Damn fools.

134
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,780
What happened, you ask?

135
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,550
Since you want to know so much, I shall tell you.

136
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,920
I didn't expect a commander be on standby in this lift.

137
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,080
I was given an order to protect the Toys' House,

138
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,320
so I got on the lift to go down and wait in ambush at the underground trading port.

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
But I got on it a second time.

140
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
In other words...

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,310
G, for I Got on the wrong lift!

142
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,010
I won't let you go to the palace, intruders.

143
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,190
No... You will let us pass!

144
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:10,390
Royal Palace Rampart 
Tower B-1

145
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,130
Straw Hat Luffy has entered Rampart Tower B-1!

146
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,970
Which way?

147
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,920
Left.

148
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,990
There's nobody here. Just you wait, Mingo!

149
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,690
The guards can't keep up with us.

150
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
What is that?!

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,250
A stone monster?!

152
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,880
Oh no! It's Pica!

153
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,280
It's huge! What is that thing?!

154
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,100
Be careful! He's one of the Family's top officers!

155
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,890
That stone monster?

156
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,960
Pica ate the Stone Fruit and gained the power to merge with stone!

157
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
So he's not just a stone man.

158
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
He can merge with any stone he touches.

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Meaning, that since this palace is made of stone,

160
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,180
he can control the entire thing!

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,960
The walls!

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,720
Corrida Colosseum

163
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,810
There's another bloodthirsty Fighting Fish jumping out!

164
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,360
It's charging at Burgess!

165
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,530
Wave Motion...

166
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,240
Elbow!

167
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,660
The Colosseum is shaking!

168
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,790
It blasted a massive hole in the spectator's seats! {Xemnas: There are a lot of holes being made this ep.}

169
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,760
Burgess' powerful Wave Motion Elbow!

170
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,420
The upstart pirate, Blackbeard and the ten Fleet Captains that support him.

171
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,650
This is one of them, Jesus Burgess.

172
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,760
That bastard!

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,250
Don't involve the audience!

174
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,540
What a destructive power!

175
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,620
Oh, another Fighting Fish has appeared.

176
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,220
It's charging toward the right.

177
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,170
This is...

178
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,710
It's here, it's here, it's here!

179
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,140
It's shown up! The one with the Devil Fruit on its back, Fighting Fish 01!

180
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,710
There it is.

181
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,030
Is it after Bartolomeo?!

182
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,230
Or so we thought, before it changed directions!

183
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,150
Just who is it after?

184
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,720
Who is Fighting Fish 01 after?!

185
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,410
Ah, it's going after Rebecca!

186
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,190
I'll at least cut those chains.

187
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,460
Alright, I've got ya!

188
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,640
As if I'd let you!

189
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,200
You want a fight?

190
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,820
Alright! Lucy and Diamante are facing off!

191
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
Straw Hat!

192
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,600
Now you're up against me!

193
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,100
I'll be the one to take the Flame Fruit!

194
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,010
I'll take you both down at once.

195
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,830
Burgess has taken his stance again!

196
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,960
Run!

197
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,520
It's coming again!

198
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,770
Sly bastard, standing behind me!

199
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,840
Not gonna dodge, huh, Lucy?

200
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,770
Wave Motion...

201
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,550
Dragon's Claw!

202
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,500
Lucy!

203
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Oh my, Burgess' armor has been shattered!

204
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,750
A-As expected of my Grand Senpai.

205
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,150
I guess you won't just give me the Flame Fruit.

206
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,440
His fighting style is different.

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,360
Is this guy really Straw Hat?

208
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,350
Underground Commerce Port 
Usopp's group

209
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,930
Current Location

210
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,740
Toys keep coming out.

211
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,310
This is clear proof that Sugar is in the Commanders' Tower.

212
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,080
What are those tubes for?

213
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,390
Right in the middle of that tower lies the commanders' private lift.

214
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,120
As for the pipes extending all around it,

215
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,600
big humans and broken toys are sent in through those.

216
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,830
There are numerous entrances to the scrapyard all throughout Dressrosa,

217
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,610
Get dropped into any one of them,

218
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,680
and you'll reach the scrapyard, located right below the Officers' Tower.

219
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm fed up with this! First a mountain of garbage, now this?

220
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,110
Where am I?

221
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,320
And what is this slimy stuff?

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,980
I thought it was weird that they sent me to the medical room when I wasn't injured.

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,920
It's not "slimy stuff"! It's "Sticky"!

224
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,630
Get back! Who the hell are you?!

225
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,310
This is the Officers' Tower.

226
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,820
Inside the Officers' Tower

227
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:58,960
But this factory where toys are born...

228
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,870
also has another name.

229
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,680
Sugar! What is that other name?

230
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,930
The Officers'' Tower.

231
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,970
No!

232
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,220
Oh, snot came out! My nose is running!

233
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,150
Gross. Die.

234
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,880
I won't die! I won't listen to a little kid like you!

235
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,960
Donquixote Family Elite Officer 
Trebol ♣ (Ate the Sticky Fruit)

236
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,100
Child, I can't move! Please get this sticky fluid off me!

237
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,490
Time to make the contract.

238
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,560
Do not harm humans.

239
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,780
Obey the Family's orders.

240
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,140
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,440
Hey, what's wrong with my body?

242
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,350
Please put me back to-

243
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,300
Be quiet and get to work!

244
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,790
What? I can't speak!

245
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,010
Why can't I resist his commands?!

246
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,560
Obey the Family's orders.{Copy-paste from 30 seconds ago or so.}

247
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,430
Contract?!

248
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,460
Nobody remembers you anymore.

249
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,810
Even I've forgotten who you were.

250
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:13,100
You will work for Doffy or fight for him until you die!

251
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,960
What is going on?! I've been turned into a toy!

252
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,650
Exit through that door, and you'll be at the port.

253
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,760
Ah, a new worker! Your station will be...

254
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,880
Where am I?!

255
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,680
Don't drop the cargo!

256
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,050
...right here. Now, get to work!

257
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm a pirate! This is just a bad dream. Wake up, me!

258
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,210
Get moving!

259
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,240
No, I don't want to work!

260
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,060
I refuse to spend the rest of my life working with these creepy toys!

261
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
So this was where they smuggled the weapons from?

262
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,390
But I can't resist them! I can't do anything!

263
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,830
I can't believe they had a port underground.

264
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,060
I have to contact the others...

265
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,610
Koala is waiting for my report!

266
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,090
Is there no way for me to move freely?!

267
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,180
I am the king of Prodence! Damn you, Doflamingo!

268
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,610
Will I be a toy for the rest of my life?
You can't be serious!

269
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,350
Somebody, help!

270
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,560
So they are Trebol and Sugar.

271
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,190
She really is a kid.

272
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,590
That's right.

273
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,330
She loves grapes. She's always eating them.

274
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,000
What about it?

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,630
That's essential to our plan.

276
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,400
Look at this!

277
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,200
This is a lump of the world's spiciest seasoning, tatababasco!

278
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,450
We've disguised it as a grape!

279
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,950
And you're giving that to Sugar?

280
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm going to sneak it into her basket.

281
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
We've tested it on fifty Tontattans.

282
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,870
Every single one of them fainted, and twenty-eight nearly died!

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,490
You've tested it?

284
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,100
The plan is flawless! We just have to make her eat this.

285
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,880
Alright! Go, Leo!

286
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,800
I will watch over you!

287
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,110
That's so reassuring.

288
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,560
If a panic breaks out... I'm outta here.

289
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,870
Hang in there, Leo!

290
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,380
Yeah!

291
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,750
Be quiet, you guys!

292
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,820
Watch out for Trebol!

293
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,980
Be careful!

294
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
You're way too loud!

295
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
No problem.

296
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,170
All of you, prepare yourselves!

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,740
Once Sugar screams out...

298
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,250
all the toys in this country will turn back into big humans!

299
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,840
All the forgotten memories will come back!

300
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,140
With all his evil deeds exposed...

301
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,160
the pirate Doflamingo's...

302
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,610
true nature will be revealed!

303
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,090
I'm going. We will save our friends!

304
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah!

305
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm telling you to be quiet!

306
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,390
We will reclaim King Riku's country!

307
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,010
Yeah!

308
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,870
Oh come on!

309
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,710
Shut up already!
