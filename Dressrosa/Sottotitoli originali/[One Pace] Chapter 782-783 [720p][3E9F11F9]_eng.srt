I'm just trying to smash Law's head in!

1165
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,860
A clash of Conqueror's Haki!

1166
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,660
He can use it too?!

1167
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,940
Straw Hatter...

1168
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,980
I knew he had it!

1169
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,900
Wh-Wh...

1170
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,020
What?!

1171
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,960
Everyone got knocked out?!

1172
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,120
That must be Haki!

1173
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
"Haki"?

1174
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,960
And what's more, it's the Conqueror's Haki!

1175
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,060
That's proof that you have the qualities of a king.

1176
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,840
Doflamingo!

1177
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,620
You're the man chosen by the heavens!

1178
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,080
Now...

1179
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,520
If you're really a man, then put yourself to the test.

1180
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,540
There someone out there you wanna kill?

1181
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Do you want me to give you... the strength to take revenge?

1182
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,440
People I want to murder...

1183
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,000
There's so many!

1184
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,420
Doffy's different!
He's of a totally different caliber!

1185
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,960
His birth nurtured madness in him!
His fate fed him anger!

1186
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,680
Those things turned this man into the perfect demon!

1187
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,860
He is no less than the ultimate evil!

1188
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,450
I don't give a damn!

1189
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,710
Mingo!

1190
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,000
Eat this!

1191
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,760
Mingo!

1192
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,540
Rubber...

1193
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,360
Doffy's madness will...

1194
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,020
destroy everything!

1195
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Eagle...

1196
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,720
Bazooka!

1197
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,660
Athlete String!

1198
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,140
Sticky Stick!

1199
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,580
What the hell is this?!

1200
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,540
You idiot! Don't think a weakling like you can beat Doffy!

1201
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Dammit, let go of me!

1202
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,240
Now, Doffy, I'll stall Straw Hat.

1203
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,700
Trample Law's head while you have the chance.

1204
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Hey! Don't do it, Mingo!

1205
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,160
Fight me! Traf can't even move a finger!

1206
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,080
I said, "wait for your turn"-

1207
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,650
Shut up! This jerk is so icky!

1208
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,940
Sticky, not icky!

1209
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,030
It's no use!

1210
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,910
What?! What's going on?!

1211
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,450
If he's a Logia user the Color of Arms should work!

1212
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,050
Well then, is my ability really a Logia-type?

1213
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,990
Either way, that crap doesn't work against me!

1214
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,050
You rubber idiot!

1215
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,910
Straw Hatter!

1216
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,250
He's right, that won't work on a papier-mâché bastard like him.

1217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,150
P-P-Papier-mâché?!

1218
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,070
The main reason I didn't want to sit on the Seat of Hearts...

1219
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,530
was because I didn't want to be
lumped together with morons like them!

1220
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,130
So you can still move that mouth of yours.

1221
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,290
What're you saying, you talking corpse?!

1222
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,130
We top commanders are the foundation of the Family!

1223
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,910
I'll never forgive anyone for making fun of us!

1224
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,670
Sticky-Stick...

1225
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,790
Launcher!

1226
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,530
Stop! Traf can't even move!

1227
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,690
Law, you bastard!

1228
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,850
I gotta teach this brat a thing or two!

1229
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,680
Move, Doffy!

1230
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,570
Listen up, Law!

1231
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,610
Doffy will always be the one true king.

1232
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,330
However...

1233
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,410
We, the current top commanders, are his perfect equals!

1234
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,810
That's because...

1235
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,450
one day, some thirty years ago,

1236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,270
the four of us acquired this immense gift that fell from the heavens!

1237
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,270
We granted him power,
and raised him to be a charismatic force for evil!

1238
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,970
You were almost killed in the Holy Land of Mariejoa?

1239
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,170
Even after bringing them your father's head?

1240
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,340
Even so, I'm glad that you came back alive!
It's a miracle!

1241
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,990
Doffy, you have the qualities of a king.

1242
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,200
Doffy. We swear to support you in everything.

1243
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,550
Doffy, in return, show us your dream.

1244
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,770
What's the matter, Doffy?

1245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,260
Where'd you get that wound?

1246
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,910
Some hoodlum did this. He should just die.

1247
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,210
Okay. I got it.

1248
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,110
The hell you want?

1249
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,210
Hey, hey, was it you who hurt Doffy?

1250
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,330
Oh, that brat.
I just teased him a bit!

1251
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,610
What's wrong?
Did somebody hurt you again?

1252
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,790
No, I just fell because the road was uneven.

1253
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,730
The road? Which town was it?

1254
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,330
Oh, I see. This needs to be repaired.

1255
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,310
Got it, Doffy?

1256
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,090
You're a king.

1257
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,750
Rebellion against you is forbidden.

1258
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,110
You're the man who will one day...

1259
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,550
rule as king of the seas!

1260
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,270
We set up Doffy as a king,
and proved his worth to all our subordinates!

1261
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,090
But the five of us; Doffy and the top commanders,

1262
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,950
all value the family equally,

1263
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,570
and we've raised it to its current status!

1264
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,310
Like a real family!

1265
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,650
Understand, Law?

1266
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,170
Do you remember that my mucus is flammable?

1267
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,810
I can shut that annoying mouth of yours instant-

1268
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,050
"Family"?

1269
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,050
It's only you guys who think that, Trebol.

1270
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,560
He doesn't give a damn about you guys.

1271
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,520
Wh-What did you say?!

1272
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,730
How pathetic.

1273
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:50,710
You act like you're his chief of staff, but to me you look like Doflamingo's foolish jester!

1274
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,810
F-F-Foolish jester?!

1275
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,390
Unforgivable!

1276
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,830
Hey, don't fall for it, Trebol!

1277
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,030
Room!

1278
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,030
You're inside his Room!

1279
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,790
This brat is barely alive as it is...
but I've also restrained his movement with my mucus!

1280
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,770
What can he do under these circumstances?

1281
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400
Now, open your mouth!

1282
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,500
Stop!

1283
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,160
You insolent brat!

1284
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,350
I'll shove this down your throat and impale you!

1285
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,720
Stop!

1286
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm a ship's captain, too!

1287
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,300
If I leave both you and Doflamingo
in Straw Hatter's hands,

1288
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,760
I'll lose face!

1289
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,600
You can't even move! What can you do?

1290
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,140
Damned worm!

1291
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,260
Die!

1292
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,200
Tact!

1293
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,230
What are you-

1294
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,300
His arm?!

1295
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,640
Sterben!

1296
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,640
{\an8}Blade of Death

1297
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,710
4th Step
Flower Field

1298
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,130
Is something wrong, Leo?

1299
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,530
SMILE Factory

1300
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,140
What's the matter, guys?
Everyone's facing the town all of a sudden.

1301
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,920
I-I don't know why, but...

1302
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,340
I feel like a huge load has been
lifted off my chest...

1303
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,900
Hey! We don't have time for that crap!

1304
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,700
We finished destroying the factory!

1305
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,580
We've gotta get away from the shrinking bird cage!

1306
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,630
Royal Palace

1307
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,650
What is that?!

1308
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,200
This super-skinny old guy
came out of the gooey stuff!

1309
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,420
So that's why my punch went right through his body!

1310
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,880
Curse you, Law...

1311
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,260
You damn fool!

1312
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,020
Law...

1313
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,660
You die as well!

1314
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,740
Oh, shit! He's gonna light us up!

1315
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm taking you with me!

1316
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,420
The Royal Palace burst into flames!

1317
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Luffy! Doflamingo is...

1318
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,510
Luffyland!

1319
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,100
Is he gonna be alright?
We gotta back him up somehow!

1320
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,840
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
Frankly, you might cause him more trouble.

1321
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,040
Look! Even Trafalgar Law,
a Warlord of the Sea just like Doflamingo,

1322
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
has been gravely injured!

1323
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,180
Lawland!

1324
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Luffy!

1325
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,160
Luffy! Send Traf-kun this way!

1326
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,700
Robin! Thanks for the help!

1327
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,520
Take care of him! Traf's done enough to corner Mingo!

1328
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,060
It can't be... his arm!

1329
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,470
Cien Fleur: Spider Net!

1330
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,470
{\an8}Hundred Flower: Spider Net

1331
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,490
Lawland's arm is...

1332
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,180
How terrible...
Traf-kun, stay with me!

1333
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,460
Nico Robin!

1334
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,280
Don't do anything unnecessary!

1335
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,800
He's still breathing.

1336
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,980
I haven't dismissed him yet.

1337
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,400
Doflamingo!

1338
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
That bastard's still going for Traf!

1339
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,120
I'll finish you off!

1340
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,900
Rubber...

1341
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,940
Bullet String!

1342
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,400
...Hawk Whip!

1343
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,550
Damn!

1344
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,680
Robiland!

1345
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,260
Traf! Robin!

1346
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,930
Precious Metal Axe!

1347
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,980
Cabbage-kun!

1348
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,930
I'm sorry. I just woke up.

1349
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,100
Haven't you settled this yet, Straw Hat?!

1350
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,880
Cabbage!

1351
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,920
Take everyone and get off this plateau!

1352
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,800
Don't be absurd!

1353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,880
Doflamingo's standing right here in front of me!

1354
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,460
Let me get in at least one hit!

1355
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,220
I'm leaving everybody else in your hands!

1356
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,820
Le-Leave them in my hands?

1357
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,020
Trust...

1358
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Respect...

1359
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,640
Popularity!

1360
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,830
Straw Hat's now my fan.

1361
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,820
A fan is asking me a favor...

1362
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,280
I can't turn it down!

1363
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Bartolomeo should be on the lower level.

1364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,420
Let's use his powers to get down from here!

1365
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,140
Can you treat him somehow, Leo?

1366
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,830
The cut is ragged.

1367
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,640
If I can manage to sew him together...

1368
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,400
If you can do that,

1369
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,860
I can heal him with my Watering Can.

1370
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,600
In any case, we'd better do as Lucy said and head down.

1371
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,460
Hey, Bartolomeo!

1372
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,500
Make stairs with your barrier!

1373
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,420
Zoro-senpai!

1374
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,120
Forever!

1375
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,220
Are you even listening, you ass?!

1376
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,900
That's quite enough,

1377
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
Straw Hat.

1378
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,320
Law is suffering because he can't die.

1379
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,820
It's better to put him out of his misery.

1380
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,130
If that's what you wanna do, do it after you beat me!

1381
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,120
You're looking quite drained out as it is.

1382
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,760
Same goes for you!

1383
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,720
There's no way all those attacks from Traf left you without a scratch!

1384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,540
Bazooka!

1385
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,370
You've definitely got speed, but...

1386
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,430
your attacks have no weight to them.

1387
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
Overheat!

1388
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,120
This brings back memories!

1389
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,060
Crocodile was defeated?

1390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,040
By a captain from Navy HQ?

1391
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,360
Those liars. There must be a catch.

1392
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,020
See? It's gotta be him.

1393
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,980
His bounty jumped up.

1394
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,880
Find out about this crew. I've never heard of them.

1395
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,280
Monkey... "D."?

1396
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,600
And the Paramount War in which
you fell from the sky!

1397
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,580
I can't believe you survived and made it this far!

1398
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,940
Wait!

1399
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,520
You're awake, Trafalgar!

1400
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,220
Leave me... here!

1401
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,990
What are you saying?!

1402
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,820
For the past thirteen years...

1403
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,280
I've stayed alive just to kill Doflamingo.

1404
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,940
I've done... everything I can.

1405
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,580
I've gotta leave the rest to Straw Hatter.

1406
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,740
If he's gonna win,

1407
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,620
I want to witness it with my own eyes, here!

1408
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,900
If he loses, I need to be here and

1409
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,460
die along with him!

1410
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,650
I...

1411
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,540
got him involved in this fight.

1412
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,000
I wanna see this through, right here.
Just leave me!

1413
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,100
Trafalgar...

1414
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,570
Traf-kun...

1415
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,460
Captains in an alliance must be on equal footing.

1416
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,990
Luffy is here of his own free will.

1417
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,440
He won't fight if he doesn't have the will to do so.

1418
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,220
Leave me here...

1419
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,720
I'm begging you!

1420
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,340
I guess there's no talking you out of it, huh?

1421
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,020
Nico Robin, go on ahead.

1422
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,100
Cabbage-kun!

1423
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,120
I can't abide by a death wish.

1424
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,130
I'll stay here, too.

1425
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,380
You'll just have to deal with it.

1426
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,120
If you're gonna die,

1427
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,840
it's gonna be after me.

1428
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,150
Robin-senpai!

1429
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,640
Robin-san!

1430
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,720
Bartolomeo made us stairs!

1431
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,920
Go.

1432
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,950
Here, take this.

1433
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,780
Gear Third!

1434
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,680
Rubber...

1435
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,450
Grizzly Magnum!

1436
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,500
You're wide open!

1437
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,100
So you don't wanna let Law's attack go to waste, huh?

1438
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,140
How long will it take you...

1439
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,660
to take me down?

1440
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,820
You know, the one hour time limit...

1441
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,840
is the time you have left until the bird cage contracts completely.

1442
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm sure there are people with bum legs.

1443
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,750
There are also the bedridden old people and suckling babies.

1444
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,730
Who will be the first victims?

1445
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,280
After 30 minutes,
casualties will begin appearing.

1446
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,340
After 40 minutes,
we'll start hearing their screams here.

1447
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,100
And after 50 minutes,

1448
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,710
the whole country will be covered in red, as though tomatoes were crushed.

1449
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,980
After an hour, there will not be a single voice left to be heard.

1450
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,580
I know that what happens to Dressrosa is none of your concern. However...

1451
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,840
Those meeting their end today will
bear grudges against the lot of you.

1452
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,940
If only you guys hadn't come here,
Dressrosa could have remained peaceful!

1453
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Liar! It only looked that way!

1454
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,960
Wherever you go in the world,
you'll always find unfortunate souls.

1455
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,480
If you try to save them all, there's no end.

1456
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,480
You're just a pirate passing through, and you're gonna play hero?

1457
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,730
How dare you stand in my way!

1458
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,300
Wrong! You're in my way!

1459
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,000
You made my friends cry and my crewmates angry!

1460
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,740
But you still haven't gone down,

1461
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,820
so I'm taking everything upon myself!

1462
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
I won't let anybody die!

1463
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,660
You and your bird cage are standing in my way!

1464
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,080
