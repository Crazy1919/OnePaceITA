00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,600
Don't let your guard down. Our enemy is Doflamingo.

1165
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,670
Sengoku, that fool...

1166
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:06,130
Navy HQ
Vice Admiral Tsuru

1167
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,140
Just where did he get this kind of information?

1168
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,010
Vice Admiral Tsuru!

1169
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,700
Hmm?

1170
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,510
We got a call from the scout ship at Minion Island!

1171
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,010
The Island where the pirate Barrels is hiding
Minion Island

1172
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,280
Barrels' hideout is on fire?

1173
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,040
Yes! We're sending men to investigate.

1174
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,060
Idiot!

1175
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,230
If they see you, the deal will be off!

1176
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,230
Check the coastal area now and report back if you spot anyone suspicious.

1177
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, ma'am!

1178
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,490
Ghost Town
The Pirates' Hideout

1179
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,860
Hurry up and put out the fire!

1180
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,020
Captain Barrels!

1181
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,410
Hang in there!

1182
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Move it!

1183
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,490
Forget about my wounds!

1184
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,360
It's a five billion belly deal!

1185
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,000
Get the Operation Fruit back!

1186
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Cora-san...

1187
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,860
Good. You're okay.

1188
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,440
Silent.

1189
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,850
Look!

1190
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,110
It's the Operation Fruit!

1191
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,700
The building is on fire, and I heard some gunshots...

1192
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,600
so I thought maybe something happened to you...

1193
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,660
Hey! That's beside the point!

1194
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,250
You gotta celebrate!

1195
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,160
This Devil Fruit will save your life!

1196
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,140
But even if I eat it, you don't know...

1197
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,410
if it will cure my disease...

1198
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,290
What are you saying?! It will!

1199
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,980
Now, eat it! Here! Eat it quickly!

1200
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,860
What are you doing?!

1201
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,680
Gross!

1202
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,020
There! Chew it like this!

1203
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,090
Chew it up and swallow it down!

1204
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,800
H-Hey, Cora-san!
I wasn't ready to become a Devil Fruit user...

1205
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Cora-san?

1206
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,400
H-Hey!

1207
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,580
This is enough.

1208
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,700
You can... cure yourself now...

1209
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,760
We've outsmarted Doflamingo... We won...

1210
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,710
What's wrong, Cora-san?

1211
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,120
Are you tired?

1212
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,310
Wait a minute!

1213
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,120
You're covered in blood!

1214
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,050
Cora-san, did you get shot?!

1215
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
Yeah, I made a little blunder...

1216
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,970
Damn! What are you doing, Cora-san?!

1217
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,840
Oh yeah!

1218
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,660
Get better! Get better!

1219
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,270
Get better!

1220
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,430
Stop, blood! Stop!

1221
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,700
Operation power! Heal him!

1222
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,680
You fool...

1223
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,710
I told you the ability doesn't work like magic.

1224
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,480
What am I supposed to do, then?!

1225
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,640
You... got shot because of me, right?!

1226
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,900
Law... I'll be alright.

1227
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,780
These wounds won't kill me...

1228
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,440
Cora-san!

1229
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,560
But I want to stop the bleeding for a while...

1230
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,900
Listen carefully, Law.

1231
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,590
We succeeded in stealing the Operation Fruit.

1232
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,920
But Doffy will still come for us.

1233
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm sorry to use you when you're weakened, but I need you to do me a favor.

1234
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,480
There's a Navy scout ship off the west coast of the island...

1235
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,080
I want you to hand this over to them...

1236
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,500
All of the marines will know what it is
once they see this cylinder.

1237
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,420
This small package will save...

1238
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,340
a far-off kingdom called Dressrosa.

1239
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,540
A kingdom?

1240
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,230
But I hate the Navy...

1241
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,170
You're the son of a doctor, aren't you?

1242
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,240
As soon as you finish delivering this, let's get off of this island!

1243
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,350
And let's travel all around the world, just you and I.

1244
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,660
The marines...

1245
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,640
He's all by himself!

1246
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,870
Hey, take this!

1247
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh, it must be a secret letter.

1248
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,140
Someone asked you to give me this, right?

1249
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,720
Thank you.

1250
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,880
I'll keep it. Don't worry.

1251
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,010
By the way, little boy, you sound so weak...

1252
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Can I... trust you?

1253
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,610
Yeah, if you're talking about the letter, I'll take responsibility and...

1254
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,720
I need you to help someone!

1255
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,810
H-He got shot and he's dying!

1256
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,710
Please! Save him!

1257
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,720
I don't want him to die!

1258
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,040
He got shot... because of me!

1259
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,880
Cora-san!

1260
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,170
He said he's gonna give you first aid!

1261
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,090
Cora-san!

1262
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,580
Vergo!

1263
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,530
Corazón?! What are you doing here?!

1264
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,910
Huh? Did you just talk?!

1265
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,420
Oh no! Don't tell me his secret mission is...

1266
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,520
You two know each other?

1267
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,090
Vergo... Wait...

1268
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Vergo?

1269
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,430
A strong member of the Family, who's currently working alone on a secret mission of some sort.

1270
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,570
The details of the mission were kept secret from even the Family.

1271
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,130
He has nothing to do with you.

1272
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,080
Don't! That's...

1273
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,460
So Vergo's mission is to infiltrate the Navy!

1274
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,620
Curse my luck!

1275
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,830
There are thousands of marines and of all of them, he got the letter!

1276
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,770
Understood, Rosinante!

1277
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,670
Give it back!

1278
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,080
Cora-san!

1279
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,910
Cora-san!

1280
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,760
Rosinante!

1281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
Stop it!

1282
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
You... You bastard!

1283
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,740
You! You-You! You!

1284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,830
You're that Vergo guy?!

1285
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,870
"That Vergo guy"?

1286
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,260
So I guess you're Law from the White Town.

1287
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,750
I heard about you. I heard you two went missing.

1288
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,160
You have no sense of propriety.

1289
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,350
If you know that I'm your superior...

1290
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,280
It's "Vergo-san" to you!

1291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,590
Law!

1292
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,490
There's quite a bit of info in here.

1293
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,170
If the Navy got this kind of letter, that'd be it for the Family!

1294
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,260
Our future plans would all be ruined.

1295
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,440
Is the kid more important to you than the Family...

1296
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Second Corazón?!

1297
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,620
I can't believe we had a rat like you in our Family!

1298
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,820
You went missing one day when you were eight.

1299
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,920
And then you returned fourteen years later!

1300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,710
It was enough to be skeptical about you!

1301
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,050
But just because you're his brother, Doffy trusted you!

1302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,380
Rosinante!

1303
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,560
Please stop... Cora-san... He's gonna die!

1304
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,820
Whoa-whoa, you haven't killed them, have you?

1305
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,180
So what's the situation?

1306
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,090
Corazón was the Navy's spy.

1307
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,760
He was with the Family in order to take you down.

1308
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,660
Be careful. They must know all of your plans.

1309
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,900
Where are you now, Doffy?

1310
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,090
I was watching the rendezvous spot, Swallow Island, when two warships came.

1311
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,440
That was enough to convince even me...

1312
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,650
That my dear younger brother has bared his fangs at me.

1313
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,330
And it reminded me...

1314
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,260
That you guys...

1315
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,320
are the only family I have!

1316
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,660
I'm sad to say, my hunch was correct.

1317
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,270
We just landed at Minion Island where you guys are.

1318
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,140
But it was a bit too late...

1319
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,810
We arrived and saw Barrels' underlings running around saying the Devil Fruit got stolen.

1320
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
It must have been Corazón!

1321
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,730
If he's there, don't let him go anywhere! He has the Operation Fruit!

1322
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah, I got...

1323
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,920
Damn them!

1324
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,850
Oh, did they run?

1325
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,830
Well, no worries.

1326
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,700
As long as they're in the town...

1327
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,980
I won't let them get away.

1328
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,220
What's that?! Something's coming down!

1329
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,620
What the hell?!

1330
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,590
What's happening on this island?!

1331
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,300
Ouch!

1332
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,760
These strings are sharp!

1333
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,490
They're hard, too!

1334
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,670
Damn! We can't get out!

1335
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,280
What's that?

1336
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,740
That's one of Doffy's abilities, I suppose.

1337
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,180
I've never seen it before, but there's one thing I know.

1338
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,850
We have nowhere to run.

1339
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,280
Using Parasite String in the cage, huh...

1340
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,030
Yeah, this is like hell...

1341
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,920
Cora-san, what's going on?

1342
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,540
I might be able to get Law out of here, at least.

1343
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,280
I have no chance to survive now, but...

1344
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,620
Will you remember me even after I die?

1345
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll die with a smile...

1346
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,930
Because... if you think of me someday,

1347
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
I'd rather you remember my smile.

1348
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,580
Law, we gotta get going.

1349
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,520
Let's go!

1350
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,870
Doffy. This is our boss.

1351
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,380
Everyone was knocked out?!

1352
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,730
That must be Haki!

1353
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
Brother, don't!

1354
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,020
Brother!

1355
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,690
Why did you take my power away?!

1356
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,730
Do you want me to give you... the strength to take revenge?

1357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,100
We can't undo what you've done now!

1358
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm going back to the Holy Land by taking your head!

1359
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,350
Doflamingo. Rosinante.

1360
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,530
I'm sorry that you had to have...

1361
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,420
a father like me.

1362
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,190
No! Don't do it!

1363
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,200
I don't know what's going on!

1364
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,970
The town was suddenly surrounded by some sort of giant cage!

1365
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,500
We can't get in!

1366
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,680
And this might be hard to believe, but inside, the pirates had a falling out

1367
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,380
and are slaughtering each other!

1368
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,700
Dray!

1369
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,280
Where are you going? Help me!

1370
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,620
Can't you do something about the cage?!

1371
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,590
Hey! Don't go!

1372
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,980
Hideout of the Barrels Pirates

1373
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,420
It's the Donquixote Family!

1374
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
Dray!

1375
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,930
Damn! Where did that brat go?!

1376
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,950
He's never here when I really need him!

1377
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,520
Despite being our strongest fighter,
he's a spineless wimp!

1378
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,490
Doflamingo!

1379
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,940
It was you guys who stole the Operation Fruit, wasn't it?!

1380
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,300
If we did, I wouldn't have to go through all this!

1381
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,060
How dare you let it be stolen, you drunken idiot!

1382
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,080
This is a treasure hoard-in!

1383
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,040
Hey, carry this loot out carefully!

1384
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,650
Awesome-in!

1385
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,030
Not bad, not bad! They've got a ton!

1386
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,520
Stop fooling around! Look for Corazón!

1387
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,560
Buffalo!

1388
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,860
How's your search from up there?!

1389
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,540
Nobody could survive in this burning wasteland-dasuyan!

1390
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,530
I'm picking up a message!

1391
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,620
We took a boy into protective custody at the coast.

1392
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,580
We're still searching for other victims.

1393
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,650
They said the Navy took someone into protective custody!

1394
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,180
You!

1395
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,060
Doffy!

1396
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,630
Sounds like they found Corazón!

1397
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,940
Law. This is a blind spot for the pirates.

1398
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,870
They'll never find you. Stay still!

1399
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,040
Corazón went this way!

1400
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,080
This way, Lao G!

1401
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,120
What? I can't open it!

1402
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,910
Something is on it!

1403
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,000
Got it!

1404
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,330
Ouch...

1405
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,860
You lowlife!

1406
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,810
Why have you been pretending that you can't talk?!

1407
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,970
Because you and I... have nothing to talk about.

1408
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,020
Screw you!

1409
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,020
You've made a fool of the young master!

1410
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,220
That's enough, Gladius!

1411
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,190
He'll die before the young master gets here.

1412
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
It's no problem!

1413
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,760
He was trying to force an all-out war between us and the Navy today!

1414
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,080
What a sinful bastard!

1415
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,750
Hey! The young master's here!

1416
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,900
It's been six months...

1417
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,730
Corazón.

1418
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,640
You have no place to go?

1419
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,400
Then, do you wanna come with me?

1420
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,800
Marine Code 01746.

1421
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,590
Commander Rosinante of Navy HQ.

1422
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,500
Donquixote Family, captain, Doflamingo.

1423
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,320
I have been undercover to prevent a future tragedy of your doing.

1424
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,370
I am a marine!

1425
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,940
I'm sorry that I lied to you...

1426
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,480
I lied because I didn't want you to hate me.

1427
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,590
Why are you bringing it up now?!

1428
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,400
I...

1429
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,260
already knew that!

1430
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,300
You fool!
Do you think it'll help you to apologize now?!

1431
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,760
Stop telling those insipid jokes and...

1432
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,280
answer these two questions!

1433
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,840
Where's the Operation Fruit?! Where's Law?!

1434
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,520
The Operation Fruit... I let Law eat it!

1435
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,120
He's a Devil Fruit user now!

1436
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,020
He managed to get out of the cage.

1437
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,200
I bet he's been taken into protective custody by a scout ship from Navy HQ by now.

1438
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,160
You can't touch him now!

1439
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,570
Young master!

1440
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,440
We heard the Navy say on the radio earlier they took a boy under their care!

1441
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,570
Why didn't you report that sooner?!

1442
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,060
I promise, I rushed all the way here-dasuyan!

1443
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm sorry!

1444
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,120
A boy?

1445
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,220
What a strange coincidence!

1446
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,640
Law is here!

1447
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,520
Check into that quickly! I'll undo the bird cage!

1448
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,740
As I thought, Law, something wills you to stay alive.

1449
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,330
Saviors keep descending upon you one after another.

1450
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,850
Prepare to set sail!

1451
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,200
If what he said was true,
we'll sink the Navy's scout ship...

1452
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,230
and take Law back!

1453
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,940
Don't.

1454
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,600
Why would you wanna go after Law?

1455
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,660
Why would I wanna go after Law?

1456
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,490
If he ate the Operation Fruit...

1457
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll need to educate him so that he can die for me one day!

1458
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,660
I swear... Everything you've done was so uncalled for!

1459
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,670
Why do you wanna get in my way?!

1460
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,600
Why do I have to kill another member of my biological family?!

1461
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,640
Cora-san, are you sure you'll be alright?!

1462
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,300
I know you can't shoot me...

1463
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
You're too much like our father!

1464
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,090
You told me you'll be alright, didn't you?!

1465
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,150
Listen, Law.

1466
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,640
Pirates can't resist taking treasure chests to their ships whenever they find them.

1467
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,060
That means if you stay in here,
you'll definitely have a chance to get out of the cage.

1468
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,260
Don't miss it.

1469
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,370
And you, Cora-san?!

1470
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,060
You silly...

1471
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,740
Doffy wants you and the Operation power.

1472
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,640
Doffy and I are brothers by blood.

1473
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,060
Of course, he'd get pissed at me,
but I'm sure he won't kill me.

1474
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Calm.

1475
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,490
This technique mutes the sound of anything you interact with.

1476
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,030
Alright, see you in the next town.

1477
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,870
Hey, Law.

1478
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,100
I love you!

1479
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,160
This isn't what you told me, Cora-san!

1480
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,880
You said he wouldn't kill you, didn't you?!

1481
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,490
Law won't obey you... Doffy!

1482
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,560
Affected by White Lead Disease,

1483
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,570
he was doomed to die in three years.

1484
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,630
But he won over that disease.

1485
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,370
He's not the same Law...

1486
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,340
who lost his way and came to visit a crazy pirate that day.

1487
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,000
There is nothing he can gain from you, a veritable child of destruction!

1488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,910
Leave him alone!

1489
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,760
He's free!

1490
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,340
Say it again! Who did you call a monster?!

1491
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,840
Whoa! He tripped and caught fire at the same time!

1492
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,210
See? You had a quiet sleep, didn't you?!

1493
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,460
Shut up already!

1494
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,450
Not yet...

1495
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm gonna stay alive a little longer...

1496
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,690
Pull the ship over here!

1497
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,180
Because if I die now...

1498
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,020
the spell I cast on you will be broken instantly...

1499
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,040
Your voice, and any noise you make...

1500
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,940
will echo across the island.

1501
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,100
Go, Law...

1502
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,510
quietly... without being noticed...

1503
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,720
far, far away...

1504
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,450
There is nothing to bind you down anymore...

1505
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,060
whether it's the iron border of the White Town...

1506
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,240
or a terminal illness...

1507
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,430
Nothing and no one will limit you.

1508
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,400
It's Tsuru's warship! Dammit!

1509
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,140
You are...

1510
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,150
free.

1511
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,010
Fire!
