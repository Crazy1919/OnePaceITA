00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,240
Awesome!

1165
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,270
You can see inside of the Palace from here?

1166
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,970
Yes, with my Clairvoyance.
I can send my sight wherever I want.

1167
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,210
Sanji would kill for your ability.

1168
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,440
I wonder what kind of person
Princess Mansherry is.

1169
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,250
If I remember correctly, Leo said she's capricious,
selfish, and short-tempered.

1170
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,770
Who the hell are you?!

1171
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,420
Stop it!

1172
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,550
K-Kin'emon!

1173
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,460
--Oh, Usopp-dono!
--You know him?

1174
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,500
Yeah, you can let go of him...

1175
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,550
There's some kind of weirdo!

1176
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,130
He's Kanjuro, who I've been looking for.

1177
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,860
What's that pathetic creature...?

1178
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,880
Anyway, we surfaced earlier
and were surprised.

1179
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,780
Tons of people are heading towards this plateau
so I wondered what's going on.

1180
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,760
That's right!

1181
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,060
I don't think they can climb this high, but...

1182
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,730
Don't worry, long-nosed goblin man!
They were having trouble so...

1183
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,360
I made a net for them!

1184
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,350
What?

1185
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
They will be here any minute now.

1186
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,960
Why did you do such a thing, you fool?!

1187
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,970
Catch God Usopp!

1188
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,470
This rope sucks!

1189
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,250
--They're coming to get me!
--Was it unnecessary?!

1190
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
How foolish I've been...

1191
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,310
I made a blunder! I failed my savior!

1192
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,290
The only amends at this point is ritual suicide.

1193
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,930
Don't, Kanjuro!

1194
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,830
Okay, I won't.

1195
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,330
Shut up! Do it!

1196
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,310
What are you gonna do about those climbers?!

1197
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,470
Maybe...

1198
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,980
I haven't looked in that room!

1199
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,660
Ascending Above the 
Second Step

1200
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,660
Team Rebecca & Robin

1201
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,470
--Leo! Can you hear me?
--Yes, Viola-sama!

1202
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,420
I found Princess Mansherry!

1203
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,390
The Palace!
Princess Mansherry's in the Palace!

1204
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,130
Great! Where in the Palace?

1205
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,700
The small room at
the back of the chapel...

1206
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,650
Remember?

1207
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,610
A small...

1208
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,590
...room?

1209
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,300
The naughty room!

1210
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,740
Yes! That's it!

1211
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
I just remembered Scarlet-sama.

1212
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,510
My mother?

1213
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,650
Yeah...

1214
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,760
When we used to go to the Palace,

1215
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,860
we were mischievous with Viola-sama.

1216
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,380
And we'd get scolded by King Riku-sama!

1217
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,860
--Big Sis!
--Scarlet-sama!

1218
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,260
Did you get scolded again?
You never learn.

1219
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,020
It's not my fault!
Leo and those two broke a plate!

1220
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,970
You told us we could "break" it!

1221
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,480
No! I said you could "touch" it!

1222
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,840
Huh?!

1223
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,850
I'll come and apologize with you later.

1224
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,880
Really?!

1225
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,890
Yes. Anyway, aren't you hungry?

1226
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,830
We are!

1227
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,100
We all loved Scarlet-sama so much!

1228
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,570
Uh-huh!
She was always kind and gentle to us...

1229
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,040
I still remember the naughty room well!

1230
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Thank you for the information!

1231
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,670
The Palace is now the enemy's headquarters.

1232
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,450
Be careful, Leo.

1233
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,650
Roger that!
We'll save our princess at any cost!

1234
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,650
Clank.

1235
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,700
They're...!

1236
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,360
We're flying over the third level, Rebecca!

1237
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,550
Yes, Robin-san!
The Flower Field is on the next level!

1238
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,940
Something's flying towards us
from below!

1239
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,560
The real Straw Hats are beyond my imagination as I thought...

1240
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,430
Rooster-kun, watch out!

1241
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,340
Pop Baller!

1242
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,210
Rooster-kun!

1243
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,260
This is the Pop Fruit power!

1244
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,220
Oh no! My Yellow Cubs...

1245
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,930
Robin-san!

1246
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,420
I can't believe there's a group
that is trying to get to the Palace like that!

1247
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,930
It's Gladius!

1248
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,270
Pop...

1249
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,350
Diez Fleurs!

1250
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,350
{\an8}Ten flowers

1251
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,390
Rebecca, take the key to the Flower Field!

1252
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,210
I'll be fine!

1253
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,280
Robin-san!

1254
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,740
Those toys...! Don't tell me...!

1255
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,530
The Former
 Royal Plateau

1256
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,530
You're both responsible.

1257
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,030
That's...

1258
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,620
What's wrong?
You still looking for something, Viola?

1259
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,240
Sugar is awake now!

1260
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
What?!

1261
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,670
Hey! What are you talking about?!
Sugar had been...

1262
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,640
...completely knocked out
with my Special Facial Jack in the Box,

1263
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,020
and it seemed like
she wouldn't wake up for a couple days...

1264
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,620
The Straw Hats and the others...
They don't know her, do they?!

1265
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,410
Or her ability.

1266
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,390
Sugar is totally recovered!
Straw Hat and the others are in danger!

1267
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,200
What?!

1268
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,650
The Palace

1269
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,400
What?

1270
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,650
E-Everybody with a long nose, stay away!
Everyone with a long nose, drop dead!

1271
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,700
What?! I thought you'd be hungry
so I brought...

1272
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
They're just sausages.

1273
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,650
Don't bring me stick-shaped things!

1274
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,640
Snacks must be grapes!
Are you an idiot?!

1275
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,700
Turn into a Headcracker Doll like the others and go fight!

1276
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,680
I feel bad for Young Master-sama...

1277
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,690
I'll turn everyone in this country...

1278
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,140
...into toys again!

1279
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,650
First, that damn, annoying long-nose
and his friends!

1280
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,670
The Straw Hats!

1281
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,000
The Plateau - Location of the Royal Palace

1282
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,000
Team Luffy

1283
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,560
Dodge, Farul!

1284
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,600
Horse!

1285
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,430
You bastard!

1286
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,150
Rubber Jet Pistol!

1287
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,080
Farul!

1288
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,810
Stay with me!

1289
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,070
What a powerful jaw!
It crushed his head!

1290
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,060
Don't die on me, Farul!

1291
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,510
What the... I blew a hole in its stomach!

1292
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,890
You monster!
How could you do this to Farul?!

1293
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,580
Blade of Beauty! Round Table!

1294
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,680
What?!

1295
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,270
Are they invincible?!

1296
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,240
Rubber

1297
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,600
...UFO!

1298
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,510
Dammit! If only I had the key to these cuffs,

1299
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,680
What? Something's falling from above!

1300
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,300
Ouch!

1301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
I wasn't paying attention...

1302
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,420
--Crest Head!
--That must be Luffy-senpai!

1303
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,970
Robin!

1304
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,610
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
You guys are here!

1305
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,000
Nico-ya, where's the key?!
Give it to me now!

1306
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,330
She got away...

1307
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, she's just one little tramp.

1308
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,160
I know she can't do anything
even if she can get to the Palace.

1309
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,590
I'll go after her and kill her later.

1310
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,910
My name is Gladius.

1311
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm gonna take care of you all first.

1312
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
Leave them in my hands.

1313
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah!

1314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,180
What?

1315
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,780
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
And Soldier-san, too!

1316
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,810
Just go now!
To the Flower Field on the fourth level!

1317
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,030
That's right!

1318
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,950
Robin?!

1319
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,560
Rebecca's waiting for you!
Just go!

1320
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,550
Flower Field
Fourth Step
of the Palace

1321
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,840
It's the fourth level! We're here!

1322
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,110
Robin-san and the others...
Are they okay?

1323
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,320
I know they are!
Usoland's friends are strong!

1324
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,120
Yeah! You're right!

1325
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,530
Rebecca-sama!
We have to go save Princess Mansherry now!

1326
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,540
Uh-huh!

1327
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,960
Is it okay to leave you here alone?

1328
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,020
I'll be fine! Lucy and the
others will come soon!

1329
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,500
Go save her!

1330
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Okay!
Rebecca-sama, you take care, too!

1331
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Uh-huh!

1332
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,020
Father-sama must be
somewhere on this battlefield, too...

1333
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,800
Somebody made it here, huh?

1334
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,610
It's you...

1335
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,720
Third step of the Mountain
 That Holds the Palace

1336
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,420
Rubber...

1337
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,720
--Luffy-senpai, let me take this!
--Crest Head!

1338
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,820
Barrier!

1339
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,000
Those are balls of explosives!
They'll explode before you deflect them!

1340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
Wow! Cool!

1341
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh no! I don't deserve such praise!

1342
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,880
Bartolomeo...

1343
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,710
Barrier-bility: Stairs!

1344
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,900
Awesome!
You saved us a lot of trouble!

1345
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
Please use it, Luffy-senpai!

1346
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,380
Why're you looking the other way?

1347
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,740
Thank you, Crest Head!

1348
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,050
Not at all!

1349
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,930
I'm the one who has to thank you
for being born!

1350
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,960
All right!

1351
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,830
We can go straight to the fourth level this way!
Let's go, Tra-guy!

1352
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,900
Go!

1353
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,660
Soldier!

1354
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,850
I'm gonna go first!

1355
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh, wait, Soldier!

1356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,150
Cabbage!

1357
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,090
I'll keep them here! Just go, Straw Hat!

1358
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,600
My beloved horse was harmed
on this level!

1359
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,700
I can't go farther without
vengeance against those jerks!

1360
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,150
Luffy, dodge! It's the bombs!

1361
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,040
Let me take care of it!

1362
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,340
Why not use your barriers?!

1363
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,860
Hey, Bartolomeo!

1364
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,200
There is a limit on the size of the barrier...
that I can produce at once...

1365
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,690
And I used it up on that staircase!

1366
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,700
But that's all right!

1367
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,560
If it helps Luffy-senpai...

1368
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm happy to die!

1369
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,600
You son of a...

1370
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,590
I'll fight with you until you're
able to use barriers so hang tough!

1371
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,190
These dolls have no delicacy!

1372
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,230
Cinco Mano! Spank!

1373
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,230
{\an8}Five Hands

1374
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,810
I know how you feel...

1375
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,870
Rooster-kun.

1376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,610
Our captain is...

1377
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,510
...worth risking...

1378
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,030
...even our lives!

1379
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,820
Luffy is always
the trump card that leads us to victory!

1380
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,640
Mil Fleurs! Gigantesco Mano!

1381
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,630
{\an8}Thousand Flower: Gigantic Hand

1382
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,840
--I won't let you lay a finger on Luffy!
--That's right!

1383
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,850
Acacia Town
Sabo vs. Admiral Fujitora

1384
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,470
You're an odd person.

1385
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,040
I thought you wanted to keep us Navy at bay.

1386
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,070
How long will you keep up with the act?

1387
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,460
Oh boy...

1388
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,680
As you can see,
I need people to go easy on me...

1389
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,120
I don't discriminate.

1390
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,450
You scare me.

1391
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,680
You're not known as number two of the Revolutionary Army
for nothing, I guess.

1392
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,050
But I'm in a position that
requires me to do this.

1393
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,650
Please understand.

1394
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,760
Gravity Blade!

1395
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,610
Raging Tiger!

1396
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,220
Horizontal gravity?!

1397
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,370
Yeah! This is just what I expected from him!

1398
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,920
This jerk! What is he up to?!

1399
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,880
It's an all-or-nothing gamble.

1400
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,510
I'm determined to bet my life on it.

1401
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,980
However...

1402
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,980
If you lose your dice,
the game is over before you can even roll.

1403
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,600
The Plateau - Location of the Royal Palace
 Level 4
The Sunflower Field

1404
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,070
Shame on you, Rebecca!

1405
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,210
What's the matter?! Why are you running?!

1406
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,770
Why aren't you fighting?!

1407
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,280
You're a gladiator!

1408
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,780
I thought you came to kill me!

1409
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,750
At the Colosseum, I managed to put on
some good shows using you but...

1410
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,590
...if you can't fight,

1411
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,480
you've served your purpose!

1412
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I'll... put an end to you now.

1413
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,760
No, wait...

1414
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,130
You prefer a gun, don't you?

1415
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,150
Because Scarlet...

1416
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,400
...got killed by a gun!

1417
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,000
Help!

1418
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,740
Soldier-san!!

1419
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,150
Rebecca!!

1420
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,650
You're...

1421
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
Kyros!

1422
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,760
I won't let you take away...

1423
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,680
...another member of my family
from me!!

1424
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,900
This man was a legend.

1425
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,860
He was the strongest gladiator
in the history of the Colosseum.

1426
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,940
Although I couldn't protect your mother,

1427
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,630
I'm gonna protect you to the end,
with my life!

1428
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,900
Let me teach you how to fight.

1429
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,180
Rebecca!

1430
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,340
Father-sama...

1431
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

1432
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,010
As a toy with no future,

1433
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:26,060
Even though you're a gentle person
like your mother!

1434
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,800
But it ends today!

1435
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,790
What?

1436
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,420
You...

1437
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,410
...don't have to fight anymore.

1438
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,120
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

1439
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,510
Uh-huh!

1440
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,110
What do you mean by that, Kyros?!

1441
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,450
It means, today,

1442
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,190
I'll settle my score with all of you!

1443
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,900
You monster!

1444
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,940
Rebecca!

1445
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,980
Is this...!

1446
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,130
Rebecca!!

1447
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,960
Lucy!

1448
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,500
Rebecca!!

1449
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,570
The key!

1450
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,070
Lucy!

1451
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,390
Great! We both made it!

1452
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,990
The key!

1453
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,790
Give it to me now!

1454
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,180
Here it is!

1455
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,760
Hurry up!

1456
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,240
Rebecca!

1457
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,180
You jerks!

1458
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,380
Finally, we caught up with him!

1459
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,840
Finally... I'm free!

1460
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,830
We're here!
The fourth level - where Mingo is!

1461
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,170
Is that where he is?

1462
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,390
Yeah.

1463
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,920
Law! Straw Hat!

1464
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,130
Diamante.

1465
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm sorry, you two...
My hands are full with this guy.

1466
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,080
Could you take care of Doflamingo for me?!

1467
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,260
Of course!
