Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

Now, the next competitor to enter is...

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,880
...a latecomer from B block!

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,750
It only took him a year to become infamous and enter the New World!

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,160
An incomparably brutal and crazy rookie!

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,530
He roasted a whole pirate crew on a skewer and shared the video!

49
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,060
He's also responsible for bombing innocent civilians!

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,800
{\an8}He ranked No. 1 in the "most annoying pirate who should just go away"-poll!

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,000
Bartolomeo!

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,000
Every last one of you...

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,750
Can go to hell!

56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,730
Go home!

57
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,010
You can go to hell!

58
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,660
What are you doing, you bastard?!

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,110
Don't tell me it's...

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,810
It's a bomb!

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,010
It's packed and I can't get out!

62
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,270
Move aside, old man! You're too slow!

63
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,620
You're in my way, too!

64
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,750
It's "ladies first"! Let me out!

65
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,760
Forget the others, just help me! I'll give you my money!

66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,530
A ball...

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,440
How shameless.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,150
They hate you so much, brat.

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't even want those shitheads to like me.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,200
But B block isn't done yet!

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
There's one more!

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,960
He's nothing like that Crazy-lomeo!

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,570
He admires Doflamingo, the king of our country.

74
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:54,810
and declared his loyalty to him by presenting him with a pillar made entirely of gold from a distant land!

75
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,710
Oh, don't tell me it's...

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,250
Since then, he's been destroying various towns in many countries where they disrespected us...

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,720
...by calling us a barbaric kingdom of pirates, and bringing them to terms!

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,450
He is the "Bullet of Dressrosa"!

79
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,760
He's been given a great chance by the royal family!

80
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,410
Back of the Colosseum

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,530
{\an8}The medical room is that way!

82
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,200
{\an8}We don't have enough stretchers.
Walk by yourself if you can!

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,470
They got beaten badly by the champion.

84
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,540
Hey.

85
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,650
I'm not blind.

86
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,300
No matter how you disguise yourself,

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,090
I can't help recognizing the face of the guy...

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,990
...who put a blot on my record!

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,360
You!

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,800
You...

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,200
...gave the diamond-head gramps hell.

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,510
Maro.

93
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,760
It's Bellamy.

94
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Right, Bellamy!

95
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,810
Why are you here?!

96
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,960
No reason.

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,260
Former Captain of the Bellamy Pirate Crew

98
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm not a resident of Jaya.

99
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,280
Bounty: 195,000,000 Belly
Bellamy the Hyena
 (Spring Fruit User)

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,300
I can be wherever I want.

101
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,280
On top of that,

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,660
Doflamingo has been my pirate hero since I was a kid.

103
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,000
I have no interest in the Flame Fruit...

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,620
but I have my own reason to win this thing!

105
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,870
Well, then I'll have to just fight you again!

106
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,570
But this won't turn out like the last time.

107
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,100
Straw Hat.

108
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,510
I've been to Sky Island.

109
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,000
I lost my crew and it turned my view of the world upside down.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,100
You mean Skypiea?!

111
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,520
You didn't do anything to the people there, did you?!

112
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,560
Who knows?

113
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,690
Anyway, I'm not holding a grudge against you anymore.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm gonna get on board Doflamingo's ship to ride through

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
the "wild wave" that's coming.

116
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,340
I won't mock you anymore.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,350
If he wins this competition,

118
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,220
his tenacity will be recognized

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,580
and it has been decided that he will be promoted to

120
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,490
an executive position within the Donquixote Family

121
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,030
He is a real contender for winning this competition!

122
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,700
The pirate!

123
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,150
Bellamy the Hyena!

124
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Bellamy!

125
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,180
Even if this is his home, his popularity is remarkable.

126
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,110
Alright, the battle royal of Block B is about to begin!

127
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,460
A competitor will be eliminated if he is killed in the ring!

128
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,500
Or if he is thrown out of the ring!

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,430
There will be only one winner!

130
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,080
And here's the starting...

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,510
{\an3}Fighting King
Elizabello II

132
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,910

133
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,350
Military Captain

135
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,180

136
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,580

137
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,020
Pirate
Bellamy

138
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,420
Tactician
Dagama

139
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,850
Fishman Warrior
Hack

140
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,660
Criminal
Jeet

141
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,130
Bell!

142
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,720
Now, who should I start with?

143
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,620
What the hell? It's like an army!

144
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,990
That's not fair! They're teaming up!

145
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,900
You can't call something like that a battle royal!

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,860
I'd like to see you try to call us cowards after you die!

147
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,240
There will be only one winner! All we need is the result!

148
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,150
Looks like we have some competitors who have teamed up and are fighting together!

149
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,230
Is that allowed?

150
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,420
It's not very sportsmanlike, but I don't remember it being against the rules.

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,930
The man behind such a trick must be...

152
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,700
...Dagama, a tactician of the Prodence Kingdom.

153
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,920
We the Prodence Kingdom will take home the Flame Fruit.

154
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,180
Our king - Elizabello II was born to be a weapon of destruction!

155
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,930
A punch that is thrown from his naturally gifted physique is terribly powerful.

156
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,040
{\an8}He blew a hole in an enemy country's fort with a single blow, shaking the earth!

157
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,950
King of Prodence
The Fighting King
Elizabello II

158
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,770
However, his power has one drawback.

159
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,680
It takes an hour to increase his concentration and warm up to throw a punch.

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,330
He can only use it once per battle!

161
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,100
They say his "King Punch" could even take out one of the Four Emperors if it hit them.

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,890
His victory depends on his timing!

163
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,640
King-sama, how is the preparation going?

164
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,590
It's gonna take a while. Guard me.

165
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,200
As you wish!

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,510
I need you guys to earn your salt!

167
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,590
Protect the king and cut down the number of the competitors in the ring!

168
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,380
Yeah!

169
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,440
Is it okay, Lepanto?

170
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,650
For the captain of Dressrosa's army to help a tactician from another country?

171
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,360
Commander of the
Dressrosa Self-Defense Forces

172
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,360
Bellamy, money runs this world!

173
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,360
Tank Lepanto

174
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,830
I'd rather make big money than chase a big dream!

175
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,860
That makes my ears burn.

176
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh shit! I'm gonna fall!

177
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
Three competitors were eliminated by being thrown out of the ring!

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,550
And of course, in the water outside of the ring...

179
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,450
The Colosseum's famous creature!

180
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
Get them!

181
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,140
A school of Little Fighting Fish!

182
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,050
Doesn't matter if you're in or out of the ring! It's Hell!

183
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,050
No one can survive uninjured!

184
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,790
That's the Corrida Colosseum!

185
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,720
You can't hit me like that!

186
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,070
Spring...

187
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
Death Knock!

188
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,610
Abdullah!

189
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,240
Take this!

190
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,060
You're showing your back to me!

191
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,500
You cowards!

192
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,170
Abdullah & Jeet

193
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,420
"Cowards"?

194
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,170
I like the sound of that!

195
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,500
Hey you stupid Fish-Man!

196
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,540
Why are you participating in a human competition, monster?!

197
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,080
Hey, fish!

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,820
Poor man.

199
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
Huh?!

200
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,750
You are a puppet who can't speak with words of its own.

201
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,360
Let us converse with our fists!

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,480
That's a good idea!

203
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh? It's not moving!

204
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,610
4000 Tile Punch!

205
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:59,350
Like our species' hope and my friend, Jinbe, teaches... we can establish friendly relations with our fists!

206
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,350
Fishman Karate Master
Fishman Jujutsu User
100th Degree Hack

207
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,420
Hence, I will continue fighting!

208
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,630
Ow, ow, ow... Damn that bastard!

209
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,570
What the hell are you doing?! He's just a lanky, unarmed man!

210
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,670
I-It doesn't matter whether he's unarmed or lanky!

211
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,840
From the Longleg Tribe
Jiaokungdo Martial Artist
Blue Gilly

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,840
His legs are like iron whips!

213
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,220
Jeez, you guys...

214
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,550
Come closer. It's boring when you're so far away.

215
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,860
He's just a guy from the Longleg Tribe!

216
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,220
Why don't you try attacking his legs, then?!

217
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,030
It's impossible! We can't get close to him!

218
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,730
That form!

219
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,240
I can't figure out where his kick is gonna come from!

220
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,630
Hey!

221
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,580
Huh?

222
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,720
I haven't seen that gladiator around here.

223
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,820
That's the guy!

224
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,790
He's pretty strong. Do you know him?

225
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,400
I've been fighting here as a gladiator for a long time

226
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,170
but I've never seen him before!

227
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,010
Gladiators of this Colosseum are trained to fight with a sword and a shield!

228
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,880
But he uses just a sword! Like a samurai from the Wano Country!

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
Let's test his skill!

230
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,080
Okay!

231
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,830
Too slow!

232
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,590
(Former) Gladiator
Ricky

233
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,500
Did you just see what the gladiator with a skull on his cape did?

234
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,380
Yeah.

235
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,700
He's strong but I don't remember ever seeing him here before.

236
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,060
Well, I was gonna say...

237
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,970
I think I've seen him before.

238
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,960
A man who fought like that without a shield.

239
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,880
What was his name again?

240
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Look at him!

241
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,680
What?!

242
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,020
What are you doing?! Do you wanna get killed?!

243
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,390
Why isn't anybody attacking him?!

244
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,550
I wish somebody would kick your ass already!

245
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,630
Participants' Viewing Area

246
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,630
{\an8}He's fooling around again.

247
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,430
That guy is one of those annoying newcomers just like Straw Hat Luffy.

248
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,720
He's another one I want to take out in this competition.

249
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,870
What are you doing, Cabbage?!

250
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,690
I'm checking the wanted posters of the Worst Generation.

251
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,020
But I really need new ones.

252
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,720
I can barely see their pictures with these knife cuts.

253
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,190
Why don't you just let it go already?

254
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,010
No way!

255
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,160
I'll kill them!

256
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,850
There is a big prize for this competition.

257
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,920
I was hoping at least Apoo or Kid would come...

258
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,230
...I don't know yet if any of them are here or not.

259
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,740
They can hide their face like Burgess did earlier.

260
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,400
If any of them are here should I wait for them to move on to the next round or...

261
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,260
Oh, is this the place to watch the battle?

262
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,420
This is a really nice view of the match.

263
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,250
By the way,

264
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,750
how is Garp-san doing?

265
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,620
Straw Hat Luffy-kun!

266
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,740
What?

267
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,960
You know Grandpa?

268
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,140
What?!

269
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,190
I almost got killed by Garp-san once.

270
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,370
And I've made up my mind to carry my grudge even against his children and grandchildren.

271
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,990
W-What!?
