Keep pushing forward!

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070

A chain of excitements!

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,230
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

23

Spread open the chart of your dreams!

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,170
There's power hidden in the bond between us,

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160

The arena has been completely destroyed!

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,110
And is it just me, or is the water level sinking?!

33
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,580
I can't guarantee that the Colosseum is safe any longer!

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,620
Everyone, please evacuate as fast as you can!

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,540
I give up, I give up!

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,430
Watch what you're holding on to, you're gonna choke me!

37
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,760
The water...

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,870
My strength's...

39
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,970
Stop!

40
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,410
We weren't going to actually give that prize to anyone! {...Then why did you ACTUALLY PUT IT IN THE CHEST? -Starfish}{Cecil: XDDDDD}

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,260
They're all outside the arena! I win!

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,500
The one who gets the fruit wins, right?

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
The Mera Mera Fruit?!

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,100
I can eat it, right?

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,740
A winner! We have a winner!

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,380
This might not be the best time...

47
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,510
but the one who managed to take advantage of the chaos to claim the Mera Mera Fruit...

48
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,850
is this tournament's ultimate dark horse, Lucy!

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,960
He has won!

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,960
Yuck!

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,830
Ah... can't hold on... any more...

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Grand master... Save me too...

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,440
You're a man, right? Save yourself!{...Say, wasn't there a thread on the forum about whether or not One Piece is sexist? Because I find Sabo's attitude here rather sexist. -Starfish}{Cecil: I sort of get the feeling he's referring to his reputation as a powerful pirate + stuff too. Misogynist pigs.}{I'm just pissed because I can't get MY scalemail bikini to contain my boobs when I swordfight. I just made up the sexism thing to feel better about my own shortcomings. -Kae}

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,980
I thought you'd say that.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,620
Here comes another shot, so watch out!

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
What?!

57
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,890
Dammit, he ate the Mera Mera Fruit!

58
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,600
Isn't that the Revolutionary Army's...

59
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,040
Hot! The flames really did appear!

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,470
I've got his clothes!

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,310
No wait, it's just my imagination. It's not hot at all.

62
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,450
I've become fire!

63
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,380
Ace!

64
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,620
I'm using your technique!{Xemnas: Come up with your own techniques you lazy bum}

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,620

The Underground Trading Port

67
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,390
Curse you, Straw Hats and Tontattans!

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,790
I'm not letting you out of here!

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,460
Everyone, take care of Usopp.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,830
Understood!

71
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,800
We're getting out of here!

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,600
Don't let them lay one finger on Usoland!

73
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,210
You're out to destroy the Smile factory.

74
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,580
Right, Nico Robin?

75
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,280
Beta Beta Chain!

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,150
Hold it!

77
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,360
A giant?!

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,340
Are you guys dwarves? I'll be taking your friend for a bit.

79
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,940
U-Usoland!

80
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,620
You fought for us, until you were half dead.

81
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,090
From what I hear, there are people here who were toys for a decade.

82
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,600
I can't even imagine your suffering.

83
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:01,110
Ow. Don't move me.

84
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,580
If it weren't for you, we would have remained toys forever.

85
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,250
We had been turned into slaves, and you saved our lives.

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,950
Have a good look, warriors!

87
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,590
This man...

88
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,460
is the hero who lifted the curse on us!

89
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,460
His name is...

90
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,400
Captain Usopp!

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,370
Thank you!

92
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,960
What's that?!

93
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,350
The ceiling is collapsing?!

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,630
A light from the heavens!

95
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,700
D-Don't tell me... this man...

96
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,340
is a servant of God?!

97
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,850
Are we... seeing... {Ah, there we have the common One Piece Hive Mind Syndrome again. Hundreds of people somehow managing to speak in perfect unison despite taking several pauses in their sentences.}{Cecil: I love it XD}

98
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,620
a miracle?!

99
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,940
He's divine! Truly a god!

100
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,760
I ... just want to rest, you bastard!

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Will ... you just stop?

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
You're so annoying!

103
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,030
See my face ...

104
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,440
b ... leed ... ing all over.

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,040
You ... piece of shit!

106
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,600
"I will lead you"?

107
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,970
"I will lead you"!

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,710
You... really are...

109
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,020
our savior, sent from Heaven!

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,550
God Usopp! God Usopp! God Usopp!

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,820
Please guide us, God Usopp!

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,790
God Usopp! God Usopp! God Usopp!

113
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,890
What must we do?!

114
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,040
Alright...  Then destroy that factory behind me...

115
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
and rescue my tiny friends.

116
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,880
As you wish!

117
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,190
Yeah!

118
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,330
Usopp...

119
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,200
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

120
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,880
Dammit!

121
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,420
That guy wasn't Straw Hat!

122
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,620
And he ate the Mera Mera Fruit that I wanted!

123
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,860
God dammit, now how am I supposed to explain all this to Doffy?

124
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Who are those guys?

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
I'll make you pay for turning us into toys.

126
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,240
Let's take him out along with the factory!

127
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,810
Oh, they used to be toys working underground.

128
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,620
That scared me...

129
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,850
It just caught fire.

130
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,990
This is hard to control.

131
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,720
Um...

132
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,990
Wait up, leaving me behind like that was mean, grand master!

133
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,600
Sure, I am a man, and I can put up barriers...

134
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,900
He's...

135
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,740
Who are you?

136
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,010
Me?

137
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,520
My name is Sabo.

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,730
Revolutionary Army
Chief of Staff

Sabo

139
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,730
Revolutionary Army
Hack

140
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,960
{\an8}We're warriors from the revolutionary army. {Cecil: It dosen't say Fishman Karate substitute teacher on Koala? That's kinda a shame, since I thought that was a cool fact}

141
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,900
Then the first Lucy...

142
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,170
The first Lucy was the man who will one day become the Pirate King, with a bounty of 400 million,

143
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,000
Straw Hat Luffy.

144
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,210
A pirate?!

145
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,940
Yeah, he's my little brother.

146
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,980
Take care of him.

147
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,510
Luffy is a nice guy, isn't he?

148
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,420
He hasn't gotten any less reckless either.
He's exactly the same.

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,320
You're pretty reckless yourself, Sabo-kun.

150
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,620
Really?

151
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,730
Why is the revolutionary army in this country?

152
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,210
That's...

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,710
The weapons shipped from this port are prolonging wars all around the world.

154
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,580
We... came to stop it.

155
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,890
The revolutionary army has sent soldiers 
to this country several times,

156
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,030
but since they were all turned into toys, 
we could never unveil this black market.

157
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,040
Hey, that guy's dangerous.

158
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
Yeah, that's Sabo, isn't it?!

159
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,640
What's the revolutionary army's number two doing here?

160
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,480
We've gotta tell the young master.

161
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,920
But it looks like the weapons are being made somewhere else.

162
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,090
Where are these weapons being made?

163
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,100
If we could find out, it'd make a great gift to Dragon-san.

164
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,430
Royal Palace

165
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,430
Damn you, how dare you kill the young master?!

166
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
I'm gonna blow you away!

167
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,050
Buffalo!

168
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Traf!

169
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,170
I came to save you!

170
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,070
Straw Hat?!

171
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm glad you're alive!

172
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,070
You shouldn't have any business up here, Straw Hat!

173
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,540
What happened to the factory?

174
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,480
Did you destroy it?

175
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,610
This is the key to his handcuffs.

176
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,850
You've prepared for everything.

177
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,680
Wait right there, Straw Hat! Violet!

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,390
I won't let you lay a finger on the young ma-

179
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,600
Young master...

180
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,500
King Riku, sorry to have kept you waiting.

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
Just wait a sec, I'll get you out right away.

182
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,640
Sorry you've come all this way,
 but our alliance is over.

183
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,010
Get out of here.

184
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,180
Well you're pretty selfish. I'm the one who decides those things, so shut up!

185
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,080
Who's the selfish one?!

186
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,450
Hurry up and unlock the cuffs.

187
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,420
Oh yeah.

188
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,660
Our alliance is over.
That means we're enemies again.

189
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,430
If you let me go, I'll kill you.

190
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,760
Don't move!

191
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,200
I can't touch Sea Stone, 
so unlocking this is tricky.

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,020
Stay steady.

193
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,900
Are you guys even listening to me?!

194
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,400
It's the stone guy. {Xemnas: I was just waiting for someone to stomp on his head and say "Shut up!" when he was doing the whole evil laugh.}

195
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,210
It's Pica!

196
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,620
You've screwed me over far beyond my imagination.

197
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,360
Mingo's alive!

198
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
Young master!

199
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,290
Young master!

200
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,130
What kind of body does he have?!

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,700
Thanks to the release of the toys, the country is in a state of chaos.

202
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,340
And I don't know why, but the revolutionary army also seems to have invaded.

203
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,350
This is a bad situation.

204
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,550
I'll have to use the bird cage.

205
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,790
The bird cage?!

206
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,730
Right, Law?

207
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,570
Smile Factory

208
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,340
{\an8}What are we gonna do? 
 The guys who were toys...

209
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,510
are attacking the factory!

210
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,610
Don't worry.

211
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,520
Nobody can get in here without the keys.

212
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,120
This factory is as important as life itself to the young master.

213
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,460
And it's made of Sea Stone. Even the ceiling caving in wouldn't damage it.

214
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,230
And last, but not least...

215
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,240
We've got two top commanders protecting us!

216
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,050
Nobody can defeat those two!

217
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,790
This factory's protection is impenetrable!

218
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,760
In the Trading Port

219
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,790
Koala!

220
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,000
Robin-san! {LET ME BURY MY FACE IN YOUR DISPROPORTIONATELY MASSIVE TITS!}{Cecil: Wow, she really does exactly that.}{can you blame her?}

221
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,520
I knew it was you.

222
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,070
Are you doing well?

223
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,930
Yeah.

224
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,770
Sabo and Hack, you haven't changed.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,070
Hey.

226
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,340
Did you meet up with Luffy?

227
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,480
Yeah.

228
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,410
It's that guy.

229
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,680
He's our crewmate, Usopp.

230
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,690
Just let him lie down.

231
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,490
Outside the Lift

232
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,660
It's Doflamingo!

233
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,800
Excuse me, let me through.

234
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,270
The King's Land
In front of the Rampart Tower

235
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,180
What's with the noise?

236
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
I guess something's going on down there.

237
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,920
Anyway, where the hell did that rock guy go?

238
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,190
The Royal Palace

239
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,370
I must deal with this right away.

240
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,070
You freak! {Xemnas: Fixed, but I think the wording needs a bit of work.}{Cecil: idk what the raw trans is, but would something like "Freaky Bastard!" (No idea if he says bastard) or even "You freak!"}

241
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,410
How can you still be alive, Doflamingo?!

242
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,180
Want me to teach you how to kill people?

243
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,150
Soldier!

244
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,150
Kyros!

245
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,450
This is how.

246
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,690
Kyros!

247
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,170
Straw Hat!

248
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,710
There are two of him?!

249
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,210
Forgive me, I let my guard down.

250
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,720
Gomu Gomu no...

251
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,550
Arming!

252
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,660
Jet Gatling!

253
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,090
Luffyland!

254
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,630
What is that clone?!{I sure do love how the animation isn't making it obvious at all what that Doffy-clone is. For the record, he did NOT have a massive coil of strings covering his severed neck in the manga. -Starfish}{Xemnas: Anime and their censorship laws...}

255
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
That hurt...

256
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,240
It looks like a marionette made of strings.{damn, ain't she clever. -kae}

257
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,170
I've never seen him do that before!

258
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,310
King Riku.

259
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,720
Do you remember how you felt that night ten years ago?

260
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,760
The night you had to kill your beloved citizens and burn this peaceful city to the ground?

261
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,530
Please stop this!{Copy-paste from 660}

262
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,950
It still keeps me up at night.

263
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,100
What of it?! {TLC  pls double check the timing of this. Should this cover the "oboiteita na"?}{Xemnas: It's good as it is. and yes it should cover those words as well.}

264
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,370
The tragedy that is coming will be infinitely worse.

265
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,170
You're not serious! What are you planning to do?!

266
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,620
That tragedy can never-

267
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,690
I'll let you go.

268
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,850
Pica.

269
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,730
Get these pests out of here.

270
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
Doflamingo...

271
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,490
please...

272
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,430
don't cause any more...

273
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,970
damage to this country!

274
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,710
Gomu Gomu no...

275
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,310
Balloon!

276
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,810
He threw us all the way out to the garden by the Rampart Tower.

277
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,880
As long as Pica is here, we can't get near Doflamingo.

278
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,950
It's started...

279
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,750
The bird cage!

280
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
Captain, what's that?!

281
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,680
How should I know?!  
Anyway, we gotta get off the island! {I bet this guy is gonna be the pirate king. Just look at that 'stache.}

282
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,320
There's no point trying to fight Doflamingo, he'll just kill us!

283
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,620
Captain, there's something in front of you!

284
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,990
Ow!

285
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,690
B-Blades?

286
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,790
Huh? What's with this fence?

287
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,800
Doflamingo doesn't want the truth about this island to get out.

288
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,270
So he's going to...

289
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,470
kill every single person on the island.

290
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,610
The fence has us completely surrounded.

291
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Where is the exit?!

292
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
What's that?

293
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,270
Vice-admiral Bastille. We can't contact HQ.

294
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,370
Huh?!

295
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,040
Likewise! We're not getting through to our base!

296
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,210
We haven't reported in to them yet.

297
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,420
Hey! What are you doing to the people?!

298
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,860
I-It's not me! My body's moving on its own!

299
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,560
Hey, stop it!

300
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,770
W-Why did I...

301
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,340
No!

302
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,210
Stop! Get out of the way, everyone!

303
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,190
Parasite String.

304
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,890
Reporting in!

305
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,930
All across Dressrosa, people are indiscriminately attacking others!

306
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,640
Even some of the marines have started going mad!

307
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,670
If this goes on, countless civilians will die!

308
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,110
What now?!

309
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,250
T-The Royal Grounds are sinking!

310
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,830
H-Hey, the ground's lowering itself!  
What's happening?!

311
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,000
It's Pica.

312
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,970
He can change the whole terrain, as long as it's made of stone!

313
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,010
The palace is going off somewhere!

314
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,140
Wait, palace!

315
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,560
The factory is rising!

316
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,190
What's going on here?!

317
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,030
Somebody...

318
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,730
Please, stop me!

319
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,440
Flower Hill...

320
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,750
is growing and swallowing the city!

321
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,590
The Royal Palace

322
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,170
Citizens of Dressrosa and visiting guests.

323
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,740
I could simply have ruled you with fear from the start.

324
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,690
Now that you know everything, I'm sure many of you want to kill me.

325
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,190
So I've prepared a little game.

326
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,200
A game to kill me.

327
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,370
I'm in the royal palace.

328
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,830
I won't run, nor will I hide.

329
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,470
If you can take my life, naturally the game will end.

330
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,550
But there is one other way to end it.

331
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:24,860
That is, if you take down every last one of the people I'm about to identify.

332
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,330
Furthermore, I will put a hefty bounty on each of their heads.

333
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,030
Kill, or be killed.

334
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,110
Everyone in this country will become hunters.

335
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,620
There is no way out, except for you to kill!
