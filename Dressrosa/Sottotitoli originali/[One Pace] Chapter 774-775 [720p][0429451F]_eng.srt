00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,660
Don't you think they were
a little too disadvantaged?

1165
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,550
Disadvantaged?

1166
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,680
Hey, now... do you really think this is meant to be a fair duel or something?

1167
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,680
This is an execution, Nico Robin!

1168
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,980
I think you have that backwards.

1169
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,740
Commander-san, you no longer need to look over your shoulder.

1170
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,450
I'll stay with Rebecca!

1171
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,710
Thank you, I'm in your debt.

1172
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,660
I was just about to be overwhelmed...

1173
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,370
with rage!

1174
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,050
Palace Plateau
Third Step

1175
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,300
What are you guys doing?!

1176
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,680
Have mercy!

1177
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,060
W-We're just carrying away the corpse of the fallen!  Please let us go!

1178
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,480
He's not dead yet!

1179
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,720
You're right.

1180
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,030
And it might take days before he wakes up again, but we want to look after him!

1181
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,570
Please!  Have a warrior's mercy!

1182
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,530
Please have mercy!

1183
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm begging you!

1184
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,370
Okay, fine!  Just go already!

1185
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,240
Thank you very much!

1186
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,490
Jeez...

1187
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,070
The Smile Factory

1188
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,490
Oh, Senor!

1189
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,020
It got through!

1190
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,500
Viola-sama, this is the factory team!

1191
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,020
What's going on with Princess Mansherry and Leo's group?

1192
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,060
The princess might be going through a horrible ordeal as we speak!

1193
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,980
I'm so worried!

1194
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,040
I just found out something terrible.

1195
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,820
Something terrible?!

1196
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,580
Wait a moment.
I'll call Leo now, so stay on the line.

1197
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,950
Former Royal Plateau

1198
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,560
Leo, can you hear me?

1199
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Oh, Viola-sama!

1200
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,330
We're on our way up the rampart tower now!

1201
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,470
We'll reach the chapel in the palace soon!

1202
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,570
Leo, you have to hurry!

1203
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,140
Giolla is holding Mansherry, and is forcing her to use her ability!

1204
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,680
What?  That's awful!

1205
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,820
Oh no!  Hurry up, Leo!

1206
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,040
The Rampart Tower Underneath the Royal Palace

1207
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,700
There they are!  Dwarfs!

1208
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,020
They're coming up!

1209
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,730
Fire, fire!

1210
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,670
The Stairway to the Royal Palace

1211
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,320
Bring the bombs!  I'll blow them away along with the stairway!

1212
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,660
We'll get there in a super hurry!

1213
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,040
Hang on a little bit more, Princess Mansherry!

1214
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,710
Listen to me already...

1215
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,590
princess of the Dwarfs!

1216
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Behind the Chapel, First Floor
 The Punishment Room

1217
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,950
I can't do it anymore...

1218
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,020
The Tontatta Chief's Daughter and Princess of the Tontattans
Mansherry

1219
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,940
Let me go back to Green Bit!

1220
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,340
I can't help you anymore!

1221
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Silence!

1222
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,500
Who did you call Boa Hancock?!

1223
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,940
I-I never... said anything like...

1224
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,910
Don't be such a baby!

1225
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,960
It's time to unleash your ability!

1226
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,420
Look!

1227
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,520
Look at the fallen commanders!

1228
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,260
The people who fought against our commanders, however...

1229
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,310
They may have been victorious,
but they were gravely injured in their fights.

1230
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,230
If you resuscitate the commanders with your Healing Fruit power,

1231
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,530
our foes will be powerless, and have to accept their own deaths!

1232
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,400
The battle will be completely turned in our favor!

1233
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,420
Now,

1234
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,580
use the ability that recovered Sugar earlier again!

1235
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,710
Take out the watering can filled with magic water!

1236
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,060
Now!  Now!

1237
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,090
Now!

1238
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,680
I've learned...

1239
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,730
that you're bad people who caused trouble for King Riku...

1240
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,130
and that King Doflamingo is lying to us.

1241
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,140
So what?!  Stop acting so high and mighty, you brazen Tontattan!

1242
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:37,140
I don't want to cure bad people anymore!

1243
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,830
So...

1244
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,190
So adorable!

1245
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,200
Adorable!

1246
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,930
Hey, stay focused!

1247
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,680
Who did you call the once-in-a-millennium beauty?!

1248
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,900
Now!

1249
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,530
Help!

1250
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,500
Well then...

1251
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,720
I take it you don't care what happens to your friends at the factory?

1252
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,910
B-But if I heal their wounds, they'll just hurt somebody again, won't they?!

1253
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,530
You cheeky little brat!

1254
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,460
I'll do whatever it takes to squeeze the power out of you!

1255
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,590
Help me, Leo!

1256
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,470
I hit one!

1257
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,010
Kabu-san!

1258
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,470
Kabu-san?!  Leo!  What happened to him?!

1259
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,430
Don't stop!

1260
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,300
Go ahead, Leo!

1261
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,830
I'll catch up with you soon!  I'm okay!

1262
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,050
That hurts!  You're hurting me!

1263
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,900
What happened to me?

1264
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,350
His injuries were healed!

1265
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,700
I see, princess of the Dwarfs.

1266
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,820
I guess you can heal wounds with your tears, too.

1267
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,330
Cry some more!

1268
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,460
No!

1269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,880
Come on!  Shed more healing tears!

1270
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,470
It hurts!  Help!

1271
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,050
Leo, hurry!

1272
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,050
Right away!

1273
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,770
What's wrong, Viola?!

1274
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,520
Giolla noticed Mansherry's tears can heal wounds!

1275
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,020
What?!

1276
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,480
She's beating her cruelly to make her shed tears!

1277
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
What?!

1278
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Princess!

1279
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,120
I, Mousey, will come save you now!

1280
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,620
It's no use!  We have to count on Leo and Kabu-san for now!

1281
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,920
The princess of the Tontattas has the power to heal?!

1282
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,480
She ate the Healing Fruit.

1283
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,470
The basis of its power is healing wounds of living things.

1284
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,000
No wonder the enemy wants it.

1285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,140
Indeed.

1286
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,160
They're trying to use that power to bring the fallen commanders back to full strength!

1287
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,230
If they do, we're done for!

1288
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,150
This is super bad!

1289
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,610
Leo, we're counting on you!

1290
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,360
Kabu-san, hang in there!

1291
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,950
But Sugar isn't with them, right?

1292
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,910
She is!

1293
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,790
Whaaat?!

1294
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,010
They're coming back?!  You've got to be kidding!

1295
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,640
You can do it, Leo!

1296
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,530
Go!  Take back the princess!

1297
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,430
Indeed!

1298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
There it is! The punishment room!

1299
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,410
I found her!

1300
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,540
Leo!

1301
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,250
Princess!

1302
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,830
You're too late!

1303
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,170
Get him!

1304
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,680
Now, come back, commanders of the Donquixote Family!

1305
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
Round Two, begins!

1306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,100
Leo!

1307
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,400
Outta my way!

1308
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,360
You take care of Giolla!

1309
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,250
Beetle...

1310
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,830
Uppercut!

1311
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,300
What?!

1312
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,180
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

1313
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,270
Sew!

1314
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,850
Sew...

1315
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,060
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

1316
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,070
I'll line them up and try again!

1317
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,120
There's no need!

1318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,830
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

1319
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,330
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew, sew...

1320
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,960
What?!

1321
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,380
I'll sew you all up together so you'll never get separated!

1322
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,600
What is this?!

1323
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,890
Haute Couture!

1324
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
{\an8}High Class Sewing

1325
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,730
Patchwork!

1326
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,200
What?!

1327
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,290
Leo came to save me...

1328
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,590
He's like a prince!

1329
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,690
It... is... art...

1330
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Former Royal Plateau

1331
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,690
He made it!  That was really close!

1332
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,030
R-Really?!

1333
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,150
He finished off Giolla before she could restore anyone!

1334
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,490
Small person, a job well done!

1335
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,340
Mansherry has been saved!

1336
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,710
Yeah!

1337
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,260
Leo, I was scared...

1338
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,180
Princess, you gained some weight again.

1339
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,070
The Tontattan Princess, Mansherry
Rescued successfully

1340
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,270
Same old...

1341
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,940
Leo!  Leo!

1342
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
I hurt my leg.

1343
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,450
You can carry me on your back if you want!

1344
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,890
Or you can carry me in your arms, that works too.

1345
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,140
There it is!  The Princess' selfishness!{This is a callback to how Leo described her all the way back in episode 647... MAN this arc has been going on for way too long. -Starfish}

1346
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,140
If you really were hurt, you could heal yourself!

1347
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,090
You've always been a good runner,
so let's just run and get out of here!

1348
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,890
Then I'm not going anywhere.

1349
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,340
What?!  There it is!

1350
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,040
The Princess' entitlement! {I get what's trying to be conveyed with 'whimsicalness', but it sounds like we might want something more "she just does whatever she wants, whenever she wants" than happy-go-lucky. *Luffy* is whimsical; the princess is just being an entitled prat. Curb me if I'm wrong -- regardless, a better word is needed here. (On episode 647 and consistency: we should ignore consistency in this instance.) -Jules}

1351
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,930
It's not like I want your help anyway. {Tsun, motherfucker.}

1352
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,900
What's with that attitude?!

1353
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,640
I really will leave you here!

1354
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,350
Fine by me!

1355
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,540
Just carry her on your back already!

1356
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,440
We gotta go!

1357
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,410
Ow...

1358
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,290
Honestly!
You're selfish, entitled, and quick-tempered... {see line 116}

1359
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,720
You're such a bother, Princess! {"You're the worst kind of princess!" maybe? :P Or something in that vein. -JulesXemnas: It's good as it is}

1360
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,930
Leo's back... {Doesn't look all that comfortable, actually}

1361
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,570
She's nice to everyone besides him.

1362
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,930
How dense are you, Leo?

1363
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,340
This is awful!

1364
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,150
They stole Mansherry away!  Catch those Dwarfs!

1365
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,320
They went that way!  Don't let them get away! {THEY WENT THAT-A-WAY}

1366
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,390
I... I failed...

1367
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,780
But this is a crisis!

1368
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,830
I have to report this to the young master!

1369
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,540
Mansherry's ultimate ability is essential to the young master's plan.

1370
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,170
Her ability to restore things
in exchange for shortening her life!

1371
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,170
Even if something happens to the Smile factory,

1372
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,680
as long as we have the Healing Fruit power on our side,

1373
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,520
we can restore it.  I'm sure that's what he's thinking!

1374
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,360
If nothing is done, th-th...

1375
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,960
The factory will be destroyed!

1376
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,690
The SMILE Factory

1377
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,360
Franky vs. Senor Pink

1378
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,950
Senor, defend the factory at all costs!

1379
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,950
Franky...

1380
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,200
No!  Dodge, Senor!

1381
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,870
Strong...

1382
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,870
Hammer!

1383
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,860
Oh!  He dove into the ground again!

1384
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,240
Fraland, he's gonna do it again!

1385
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,930
Dodge!

1386
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,520
Meow-Meow...

1387
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,310
Suplex!

1388
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,740
Oh!  Senor!

1389
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,210
Neither of them can keep this up!

1390
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,960
Fraland!

1391
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,820
I know you could have dodged that attack, Fraland! {i so wish we could change this. "Why didn't you DOOOOOOODGE?!"}

1392
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,090
You've taken that same attack thirty times in a row now!  Why?!

1393
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,530
Stay out of this, Tontattans.

1394
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,270
Yeah... Senor took the same punch thirty times too.

1395
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,160
Why is that?!

1396
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,500
When somebody offers you a drink at a bar,

1397
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,940
if you're a real man, you don't pull your glass away! {can't or don't? don't is more natural in English, but i won't argue grammatical correctness -JulesXemnas: Don't}

1398
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,250
What?!  Then, don't tell me you were...

1399
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,420
This guy is one staunch dude.  So I...

1400
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,830
will not try to avoid a single attack he throws at me.

1401
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,380
I'll take all of his attacks head-on, and still win at the end!

1402
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,670
That's my... Strong-style!

1403
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,770
That's my... Strong-style!

1404
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,920
I know you're worried, but this is a manly duel!

1405
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,560
I'll win no matter what, so just you watch!

1406
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,770
I won't let you guys become their slaves again!

1407
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,810
Fraland!

1408
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,570
You make me drunker than some cheap bar, kid.

1409
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,750
Don't forget what you just said!

1410
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm...

1411
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,990
not exactly young anymore.

1412
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,620
Let me end it with this next move.

1413
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,910
Senor, can I say one thing before that?!

1414
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,970
You're far away!  Way too far away!

1415
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,060
You understand what I'm getting at, right?

1416
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,230
You said you'd take all my attacks head-on.

1417
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,400
If you want to live up to your manly declaration,
then take this and...

1418
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,400
try staying alive!

1419
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,910
If, against all odds,
you manage to get back up afterwards, I've lost.

1420
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,830
I'll take your final attack head-on!

1421
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,300
Fine by me!

1422
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,830
He's swimming through the wall of the tower!

1423
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,160
What is he up to?!

1424
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,520
Unfortunately, the sky isn't particularly friendly today. {LS, I really hope this was your doing}

1425
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,570
Otherwise, if I kept going up,

1426
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,450
I'd be able to see Russian.

1427
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,980
Russian?

1428
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,610
Yeah... I have a son named Gimlet, too.

1429
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:44,950
But unfortunately, gravity persists.  I can't keep going up.

1430
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,290
Hey!  What are you talking about?!

1431
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,050
Cyborg, your back is flesh and blood, isn't it?

1432
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,630
You... figured that out?! {Why is there a repeated "You"? He only says "teme" once. -Fadeout4Xemnas: Good point}

1433
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,340
Now, stop talking!

1434
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,300
Or you'll bite your own tongue off!

1435
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,700
Meow-Meow Suplex!

1436
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,700
Baby...

1437
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,530
Buster!

1438
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,430
Fraland!

1439
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,030
You gave me your word... {I'm back.}

1440
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,440
so it's my turn now!{PINK RUUUUUN. GOOOOOO. GET TO DA CHOPPAAAAA}

1441
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,450
I've lost.

1442
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,920
Sorry, young master.

1443
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,380
Franky...

1444
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,420
Iron Boxing!{Hasta la vista... baby.}

1445
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,970
Oh, right...

1446
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,510
Russian...

1447
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,760
The day that I met you...
and the day that you stopped smiling...

1448
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,530
They were both nights of pouring rain like this...

1449
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,420
The rain came out of nowhere, didn't it?  I'm soaked!

1450
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,540
You're soaking wet, but you're smiling?

1451
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,030
I... like rain.

1452
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,880
Things that I don't like?  Hmm...

1453
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,890
Oh, pirates!  I hate them to death!

1454
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,480
What do you do for a living?  C'mon, tell me.

1455
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,480
I-I work at a bank.

1456
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,650
Really...

1457
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,700
Darling!

1458
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,910
Well, Darling, what should we name him? {I think this should be "Well, Darling,", seems more natural and less casual then "Hey" -Fadeout4}

1459
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,190
Let's see...

1460
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Gimlet.

1461
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,380
That's a great name!{I disagree. But hey, woman named after an alcoholic beverage, if you want your kid to also be named after an alcoholic beverage, then all power to ya, I guess. -StarfishI'd have gone with Martini, middle name Shaken. -JulesI know the trend here is cocktails, but they shoulda just named him Vodka :/ -EaX}

1462
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,080
What?

1463
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
Gimlet died?

1464
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,340
A week ago today, the day you left without notice, {damn... that's pretty grim}

1465
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,000
his temperature went up suddenly...

1466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,630
and I took him to the hospital,
but there was nothing they could do!

1467
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,090
Liar...

1468
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,640
What?

1469
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
Liar!

1470
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,470
I called the bank several times!

1471
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,100
And they said they didn't have anyone like you working for them!

1472
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,020
Please!  Tell me the truth!

1473
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,980
What do you really do for a living?!

1474
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,210
What kind of money are we living on?!

1475
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,320
Answer me!

1476
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,450
Come on!  Can't you answer?!

1477
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,660
You're not worthy to be a father anymore!

1478
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,430
Get out of my way!

1479
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,000
W-Wait!

1480
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,080
Wait, Russian!  It's still stormy outside!

1481
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,290
Do you take me for a fool?!

1482
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,420
Don't follow me! {"Stop following me" or "Don't follow me"? "Don't" feels more natural here. -JulesXemnas: Don't}

1483
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,550
It's not what you think, Russian...

1484
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,890
The reason I can't tell you everything is...

1485
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,470
Russian!

1486
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,840
Where are you?!

1487
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,400
Russian!

1488
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,870
Because of the rain,

1489
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,910
there was a mudslide right above your wife,
and she was caught in it.

1490
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
Her condition is quite serious.

1491
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,550
In a vegetative state?

1492
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,340
Yes, she is unconscious.

1493
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,410
I'm sorry, but the way things are now,

1494
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,630
she'll probably never be able to express her feelings again.

1495
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,590
I don't know how long her body can last, either...

1496
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,050
If only you hadn't met me, you would've...

1497
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,390
Thank you, Darling!

1498
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,580
I'm sorry!  I didn't wanna lose you...

1499
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,730
So I lied!

1500
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,250
I want to hear her respond... {okay to turn this into a verb? -Jules}

1501
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,040
I want to hear her voice...

1502
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,330
One more time... {Change these to "One more time..." for dramatic effect?Xemnas: Agreed}

1503
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,160
Just one more time...

1504
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,680
I want her to smile.

1505
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,400
One more time...

1506
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,400
Russian, look.

1507
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,180
I found the same bonnet that Gimlet used to wear!

1508
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,910
Well, do I look like him?

1509
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,620
He took after me, and all.

1510
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,740
I-I'm sorry!  I went too far with that joke.

1511
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,000
If someone sees me wearing this...

1512
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,890
Russian.

1513
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,120
You're one hell of a character, old man!

1514
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,460
He lost his son, and his wife was in a terrible accident.

1515
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,930
That's enough to break anyone.

1516
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,380
Pink, what the hell happened to your fashion sense?!

1517
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,220
Hey!

1518
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,180
I'm going out.

1519
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,370
Look!  It's a pervert!

1520
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,010
Pervert passing through! {'by' or 'through'? through is more natural in English. -Jules}

1521
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,500
Disgusting!

1522
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,480
Oh!  It's a freak!

1523
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,880
Hey!  Stop that!

1524
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,000
Russian...

1525
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,410
To me,

1526
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,820
these outfits are more valuable than the finest suits money can buy.

1527
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,930
Because the times I wear these outfits...

1528
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,700
are the only times you smile for me.

1529
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,060
Senor!

1530
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,450
Fraland!

1531
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,610
Pathetic.

1532
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,430
Just what could you be recalling... {if you split on the iframe, do it here and add an ellipsisI do not like this phrasing one bit but that's what he says. EDITORS!!! Do something about it. -StarfishDone. If rephrasing any further, use something stronger than 'remembering' for 思い出して. -Julesno one thought of "recalling -Speedy}

1533
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,230
that made you cry like that?

1534
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,480
Brother.

1535
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,230
If we meet again someday, somewhere...

1536
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,750
Let's have a drink,

1537
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,830
and then you can tell me...

1538
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,180
about that woman, Russian.

1539
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,530
The battle at the Smile Factory

1540
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,410
Winner: Franky
