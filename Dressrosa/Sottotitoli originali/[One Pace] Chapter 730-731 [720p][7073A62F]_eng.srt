and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,070
Hey, what was that explosion and gunshot?!

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,290
What happened to Traf?!

31
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,200
Can you hear me, Luffy?!

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,930
What's going on over there?!

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,270
Sorry for making a scene.

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,440
The pirate and Warlord, Trafalgar Law.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,230
He's the one behind the news this morning about me abdicating the throne.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,170
He tried to force me off the throne.

37
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,620
Don't worry, I've just dealt with him.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,540
So that's what happened.

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,770
Dressrosa almost got completely messed up because of him.

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,800
Thank goodness!

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,070
Hey, Mingo!

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,510
How dare you do that to Traf!

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,610
Straw Hat, you have no right to condemn me.

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,860
Law was originally my subordinate.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,890
I'll be the one to discipline him.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,510
Kin, you carry Traf!

47
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,560
Understood!

48
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,340
Vice Admiral-dono, the Pirate Hunter is attacking. Should we capture him?

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,570
Yes.

50
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,400
Wait a moment.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,660
Hey, explain it to us!

52
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,970
What's going on?!

53
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,910
Law-dono has been shot by Doflamingo right before our eyes.{I'm not so sure about the word "defeated" here... I mean yeah, WE know he's not dead, and Luffy confirms he's not dead later, but this word could just as easily be interpreted as "killed"... and really, that seems to fit better with both how seriously Kin is taking it, and how the others react... -Starfish}{Isis: okay, so I didn't get what Starfish was trying to say here, but just in case he wasn't satisfied with the word "defeated" then how about using "shot" instead, it might be more fitting to what he wants to deliver to the viewers}

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,600
Did you hear that?

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,450
The Pirate Hunter and Foxfire Kin'emon...

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,970
I saw a kid that looks like Momonosuke on the ship just earlier.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,700
Don't let him get to you.

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
We won't let him have Momo.

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,750
That goes without being said.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,340
He's...

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,000
It would seem... 
that it'd be better for the both of us if I didn't tell you.{end copy paste}

62
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,840
Zoro!{Isis: I used the SD.mkv workraw and it just stops working right after Luffy says Zoro and til Kin'emon's line "Zoro-dono has disappeared." also on a second note, the video seems to be in sync with the audio just fine using other players, but when working with Aegisub it's not the case after this line anymore}

63
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,530
Zoro-dono.

64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,710
What happened to Zoro, Kin'emon?!

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,390
Zoro-dono has disappeared.

66
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,680
Kin'emon!

67
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,590
I'm coming now!

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Oh yeah, these were made of Sea Stone.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,020
Kin'emon-san, are you okay?

70
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,090
You haven't been killed, have you?!

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,770
Admiral-dono!

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,390
A flying slash.

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,410
This one's{aka, Zoro. Not the attack he used -Starfish} quite strong.

74
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,280
So the blind old gambling man was a Navy Admiral. How about that.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,050
Admiral?!

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,610
I thank you for before.

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,780
Even though you all helped me out,

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,430
it seems I'm repaying you with ingratitude.

79
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,860
This job often brings bad karma. {This is ugly, editor please fix this. "inga" means karma, and "tosei" means livlyhood or occupation. So he's talking about how his job as a marine has brought about this karmic situation.}

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,260
Oh my, the man with Doflamingo is...

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,040
a... a Navy Admiral!

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,450
An Admiral is on Dressrosa right now?

83
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,980
It's possible that Doflamingo has allied with the Navy.

84
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,460
If that's the case, then the number of enemies we'll be facing is unknown.

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,250
Law-dono! Law-dono!

86
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,330
How are they both flying?!

87
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,080
Are you still alive? Answer me!

88
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,950
We'll continue our talk at the palace, Fujitora.

89
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,760
If you cooperate with me, I'll give you the heads of those brats.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
I'll hear you out, Heavenly Demon.

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,950
But I'll decide what to do after that.

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,860
Capture Roronoa Zoro!

93
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,560
Looks like they know who we are.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
So it would seem.

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,530
So for now, let's run!

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
Traf!

97
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,020
This is Kin'emon, Law-dono has been taken by them! {EEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH???}

98
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,130
Hey Luffy, hurry and find an exit!

99
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,970
We'll keep running around here and wait for you!

100
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,750
Alright, I'll hurry.

101
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
I can still sense Traf{Referring to how he can still sense his thoughts and stuff with his Haki -Starfish}.  He's alive.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
It's Brook and the others.

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,790
What's going on now?

104
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,440
T-T-T-This...

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,100
What's going on on the Sunny?

106
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,970
They were behind us!

107
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,220
Dammit, they found us.

108
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,610
This is bad!

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,730
It's Big Mom's... {Considering it says "BIG MOM" on the sail, maybe we should be calling her that?}{Cecil: Obviously that's in japanese, so it translates to Big Mam. (Even though its spelled Mom in american english)}

110
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,180
... pirate ship!

111
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,780
Ship, shipâ™ª

112
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,650
What is the ship of one of the Four Emperors doing here?!{No really, am I the only one who thinks that the period is an extremely unfitting form of punctuation when the person speaking is very clearly freaking out? Not to mention that was a question. -Starfish}

113
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,070
Is the prow singing?

114
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,220
Really?!

115
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,680
Big Mom's ship?!

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,040
We're gonna die!

117
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,330
What's going on, is Big Mom on that ship?

118
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,520
I don't know, but those two we met on Fishman Island are onboard.

119
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,060
Mama, I've spotted Caesar -gao!

120
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,490
As we thought, he was with them -bon. {Cecil: This is italicized because of how he says it, right? We don't usually italicize speech quirks but I actually like the idea of doing so. But ven you get Charaters vike Ivankov who von't have seperate quirks.}

121
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,600
We should sink their ship and pull Caesar up -soir.

122
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,150
Big Mom?!

123
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,710
I told you so.

124
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,150
This is because you picked a fight with her, Luffy!

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,870
They seem to be after Caesar.

126
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,270
You're really popular aren't you, evil scientist!

127
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,150
Is that ship here to save you as well?!

128
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,850
Save me please!

129
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,130
You can't let Big Mom capture me!

130
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,100
I got my research funds...

131
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,160
by tricking her and ripping her off! {Cecil: I split this from the previous line for dramatic effect, and also padded out this line cause it seemed too short for what he says. Anyway can TLC check that it's still ok and if not, provide a literal trans?}

132
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,300
What did you say?

133
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,190
W-Well... let's not talk about the details!

134
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,800
Anyway if I'm captured, they'll find out that I've stolen the money and kill me!

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,030
Like I care about your life!

136
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,020
Well, I can't let them take you anyway, so shut up!

137
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,180
They're gonna shoot at us!

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Damn, we're getting farther away from Dressrosa. They couldn't have picked a worse time to appear!

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,430
Can you lose them?

140
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,140
Are you okay, Sanji?

141
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,740
Don't you dare bring an Emperor to this country.

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,960
This whole country would fall into panic and the soldier's plans will be screwed.

143
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,400
By the way, why is Caesar on the ship?

144
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,230
I guess negotiations have broken down.

145
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,520
Why else would Traf end up like that?

146
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,820
Law told us to take Caesar to the next island, that's why he's here.

147
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,010
Sanji-kun, I don't think we should go back to Dressrosa.

148
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,780
I'm not saying this because I'm scared.

149
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,120
Listen, Luffy.

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,670
We have three cards that we're competing with Doflamingo for.

151
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,640
Caesar, the Smile factory, and for some reason, Momonosuke. {Cecil: For some reason indeed! WHY?! Cause Doflamingo said his name once and he's as important as Caesar clown or the Smile Factory?!}{Giolla also specifically demanded that they hand Momonosuke over, so it's pretty clear that Doffy sees him as an important part of his plans... for... whatever reason. -Starfish}

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,080
We still haven't destroyed the Smile factory.

153
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,290
But we have the other two cards right here.

154
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,470
Traf fought because he was a decoy to lure Doflamingo away from these cards.

155
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,350
He may also be trying to buy time to destroy the factory.

156
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,990
If we go there and give up the cards that Traf tried so hard to protect...

157
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,230
All his hard work will be in vain.

158
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,670
You're right.

159
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,500
Alright, we'll definitely get Traf back!

160
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,460
What was the next island called?

161
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,400
It's called Zou.

162
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,170
Sanji.

163
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,100
Nami.

164
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,040
Chopper.

165
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
Brook.

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
Momo.

167
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,810
You guys, go on ahead to Zou.

168
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,290
If you say so... Roger, Captain!

169
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,610
But I'd like your permission for something.

170
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,090
Permission?

171
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,290
Allow me...

172
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,620
to attack Big Mom's ship!

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, sure.

174
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,180
You're joking.

175
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,980
We've already picked a fight with her.

176
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,490
You got that right.

177
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,630
That's too dangerous!

178
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,910
Please stop!

179
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,380
Alright, we'll be waiting for you guys on Zou.

180
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,450
Got it.

181
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,380
Leave the destruction of the factory to us!

182
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,660
Everyone, be careful.

183
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,500
We're heading to the palace.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,740
We're gonna send Doflamingo flying!

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,110
Barrier!

186
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,350
What is the meaning of this?!

187
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,390
Bartolomeo?

188
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,540
This has nothing to do with you!

189
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,520
True. I just felt like raising this barrier.

190
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,060
This is a family matter! I'll kill you too!

191
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,320
Just try. Nobody can break my barrier.

192
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,110
What? I'm busy!

193
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,290
It's me, Dellinger.

194
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,330
Sounds like you still haven't finished off Bellamy.

195
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,360
You slowpoke.

196
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,680
Oh, shut up! Something got in the way.

197
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,070
Never mind, we'll deal with that later.

198
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,950
Doffy has a new order for you.

199
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,810
Go help Lao G and the others protect the Toys' House. Right now.

200
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,610
Wait, Diamante! I'll be done here in a second!

201
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,840
Be quiet! Do you plan to disobey Doffy?!

202
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,330
"A new order"?

203
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,930
So I...

204
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,330
really was...

205
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,860
You gotta be kidding...

206
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,700
Get real!

207
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,570
Get out of my way.

208
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,050
I'm going... to kick Bellamy to death!

209
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,050
Move it!

210
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,890
No way. I ain't removing the barrier.

211
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,340
I heard that call just now.

212
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,520
So get out of here!

213
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,560
Damn barrier-bastard!

214
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,060
I'll get you for this!

215
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,090
You're not leaving Dressrosa alive!

216
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,820
Scram, you little brat!

217
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,590
That was Diamante's voice, no doubt about it.

218
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,510
So that order was for real?

219
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,950
Doflamingo really did...

220
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,490
order my death?

221
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,190
So if I win this tournament, I'll become a commander in the Family? {I THINK this is new dialogue... -Starfish}

222
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,960
Of course.

223
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,600
Do your best.

224
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,970
I've got high hopes for you.

225
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,660
I'll take you to the medical room.

226
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,710
I don't need your help!

227
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,590
I've lost my goal in life.

228
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,630
And anyway, why would you help me?

229
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,050
In the battle royale earlier...

230
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,940
I was trying to kill all of you guys!

231
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,650
We fought in the same ring!

232
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,530
What?

233
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,590
When two men have exchanged blows on the battlefield,

234
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,770
that makes them comrades in arms!

235
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,910
I'd never abandon a comrade, no matter how rotten he may be!

236
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,430
Dressrosa "Flower Hill"

237
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,430
The situation is like I explained. {Cecil: I hate redundant lines like this. "Everything is exactly how I just said it is."}

238
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,840
As for our plan to expose the tragedies

239
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,660
Underground - Riku's Revolutionary Army Base

240
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,650
that have been buried in the darkness,

241
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,090
I've given it the following name.

242
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,090
The Dressrosa SOP Operation.

243
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,270
SOP? What's that mean?

244
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,730
There is a massive underground world in this country.

245
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,000
Inside is the trade port, for making secret deals,

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,590
as well as the mysterious factory. {Xemnas: The actual wording says "mysterious factory" but I like factory of darkness, and the whole darkness does give the impression of mystery anyway. Just thought I'd mention it.}

247
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,130
Our Tontattan friends

248
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,540
Factory & trade port

249
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,320
and all the people turned into toys

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,700
are being forced to work there.

251
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,170
I see! So what does SOP mean?

252
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,190
We will break in there using the tunnel we've spent the last year digging,

253
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,200
Secretly infiltrate
via tunnel

254
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,200
and rescue everyone there!

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,300
Then we will destroy the facilities, take down the Doflamingo Family, and restore King Riku!

256
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,940
That is the objective of our plan.

257
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,540
You talk as if it's gonna be easy.

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,240
Of course, the plan is extremely idealistic.

259
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,950
We have no idea what will happen to Dressrosa in the next few minutes.

260
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,620
First and foremost, there is one mission we absolutely must carry out.

261
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Doflamingo's subordinate, the one who turned us into toys...

262
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,230
We must knock the Hobby Fruit user unconscious!

263
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,510
Hobby Fruit?

264
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,540
What do you think will happen then?

265
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,780
Will the spell be broken?

266
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,400
That's right! All the toys in Dressrosa...

267
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,220
will return to human form at once!

268
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,170
At the same time, the people will regain whatever memories they have lost.

269
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,230
We can't guess what will happen after that.

270
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:37,070
Not how many people will fight alongside us, nor what the people will think, nor what actions they'll take.

271
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,300
Or what move Doflamingo will make.

272
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,870
What move the Navy will make.

273
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,220
The only thing we can say for sure, {Cecil: Does this give any context to the awkwardly edited previous set of lines? I'll fix it up after QC}{Xemnas: Well the next line, line 198 should start here. Fixed it.}

274
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,740
is that panic will erupt throughout the country.

275
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,870
So, where is this Hobby Fruit user?

276
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,050
And he's really strong, right?

277
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,750
According to the Tontatta reconnaissance unit, {Cecil: didn't we call this the scout unit? I'll check it later}

278
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,470
she's in the trade port right now.

279
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,330
She is a special commander in the Donquixote Family's TrÃ©bol Army.

280
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,400
Sugar!

281
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,810
A girl who can turn anyone she touches into a toy.

282
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,150
She looks like a child, because whoever eats this fruit stops aging once they do.

283
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,300
She is regarded as one of Doflamingo's most valuable subordinates, {I'm a little confused about this line because it looks like way more text than belongs here, and I don't hear a "Doflamingo", but this is the only place I can see it going}{Xemnas: It's good as is.}

284
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,020
so one of his top commanders, TrÃ©bol, is guarding her at all times. {Cecil: I'd like to say executives here, since he's a rank above sugar who was also just referred to as commander.}{Xemnas: You could, how have we referred to them in the past?}

285
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,290
So if we can just make her fall unconscious, the toys will return to normal?

286
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,970
Indeed!

287
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,180
We will scare Sugar half to death and make her faint.

288
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,110
That is the...

289
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,620
Sugar

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,510
Sugar Oversurprise

291
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,150
Sugar Oversurprise Panic Operation!

292
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,710
I combined the first letters from each of those words to form the name SOP.

293
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,780
That's a great operation name!

294
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,550
If the enemy is just a little girl, then you can leave this to me!

295
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,590
Alright, I'm fired up!

296
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,410
Franky Hair Salon!

297
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,830
Battle-Hair!

298
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,990
Fraland!

299
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,960
Usoland!

300
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,380
You're so dependable!

301
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,100
Indeed! We are here for you!

302
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,700
There's no way we can lose this battle!

303
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,070
Take us to the underground passage, little ones!

304
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,080
Usolanders!

305
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,060
Meanwhile, Luffy was searching for the exit to the Corrida Colosseum.

306
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,080
Huh?

307
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,340
I don't see any exits.

308
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,670
Where am I?

309
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,590
Someday, I will work under Luffy-senpai. {Xemnas: "Shatei" is a yakuza term and means underling. Not sure if this wording fits completely, if anyone's got anything  better feel free to change it.}

310
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,290
That's my dream.

311
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,380
You could at least close the door again!

312
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,380
The toilet?

313
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,280
Oh, you're the hen-comb guy!

314
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,170
I'm so glad to see you!

315
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,200
L-L-Luffy-senpai!

316
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,900
No!

317
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,970
Keep it together, Bartolomeo!

318
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,270
Do you really want to give up the chance to speak with the Pirate King?

319
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,980
Oh, Bellamy.

320
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,010
Damn it! He's shining too brightly, I can't look him in the eyes!

321
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,470
Luffy-senpai!

322
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,260
Did you manage to meet up with Zoro-senpai?

323
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,500
Yeah, I talked to him. Thanks!

324
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,420
Oh, it was nothing!

325
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,880
So I suddenly have something I need to do, so I've gotta leave...

326
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,730
but I can't find the exit.

327
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,600
This colosseum doesn't have an exit.

328
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,780
Huh?

329
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,170
Is it just me...

330
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,070
or have your injuries gotten worse?

331
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,030
Once a fighter enters the colosseum, they can never leave.

332
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,910
You're wasting your time looking for an exit.

333
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,150
What? What do you mean?

334
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,290
For real?

335
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,650
There really isn't one?!

336
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,180
Aren't you supposed to be Doflamingo's underling?

337
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,090
So you've gotta know something!

338
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,000
His underling? I couldn't even become that!

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Please! My friend is in danger!

340
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm leaving.

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,170
If you follow me, you might be able to get out too... Maybe.

342
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,020
Alright, thanks!

343
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,290
You'll take me out?

344
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,710
All I'm saying is, you might make it out by coincidence if you follow me.

345
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,720
You want me to betray my boss?

346
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,760
I...

347
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,370
can't betray Doflamingo! {Sewil: Suck more flamingo dick please}

348
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,730
I have too much respect for him.

349
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,850
Hey, didn't he just...

350
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,300
Shut up!

351
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,270
I have my own morals I must stick to.

352
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,500
Got it. I'll tag along behind you then.

353
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,350
But then, Luffy-senpai...

354
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,850
What about the Flame Fruit?

355
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,020
There's someone I really don't want to have it, but I've got no choice.

356
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,000
My friends' lives are more important.

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't worry, I'll handle it!

358
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:26,130
It's a memento of Ace-sama. I was always planning to give it to you, Luffy-senpai!

359
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,770
Huh? You'll give it to me?

360
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,610
Of course! If anyone should have it, it's you!

361
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,700
Your accent keep getting heavier.

362
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,090
Ah'll definitely get ya the Flame Fruit!

363
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,810
Just go do whatever it was ya needed to do!

364
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,820
Who are you talking to?

365
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,580
Alright, that really helps.

366
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,420
I won't let you have the Flame Fruit...{For the record, the opening credits to the episode literally refers to him as such. -Starfish}

367
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,400
Straw Hat Luffy.

368
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,550
Who're you?{Oh, and that previous comment about his accent slipping, he seems to have recovered now... Though he's always spoken with a bit of an accent that I can't quite define which has been all but completely ignored in our subs... -Starfish}

369
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,060
Why're you just casually talking to Luffy-senpai like that?

370
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,160
He is the younger brother of that legendary pirate Fire Fist Ace-sama,

371
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,800
and the future Pirate King, you dumbass!

372
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,290
I've known that for a long time.

373
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,630
Now the real battle starts!

374
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,220
You'd better make it to the final round! { def: wait, wouldn't that mean that she's hoping to be eliminated herself?  that seems mighty nice of her }

375
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,920
Sure!

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,610
What's he doing? How dare he act all chummy with Luffy-senpai?!

377
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,260
See? He got him mad!

378
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:17,080
The plaza outside the Corrida Colosseum

379
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,240
Why'd you come out crying?!

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,360
You couldn't find the Pirate Hunter?!

381
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,910
Didn't I tell you to keep your guard up?! {Man, they sure are running ridiculously slowly. -Starfish}{Xemnas" Dat slow mo running.}

382
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,300
Call the Vice-Admiral!

383
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,770
Yes, Sir!

384
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,340
The Navy has completely fallen for our disguise. They believe us to be toys.

385
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,250
This is still cutting it too close!

386
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,520
And why'd you choose these specific animals?

387
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,330
I thought these animals were kewl! Especially, carps? {Yeah I just copied FUNi verbatim here, because while I got that he was making some sort of lame pun, I didn't get WHAT the lame pun was... So here, have the lame pun FUNi used. -Starfish}{Cecil: Xemnas pls, I'd rather we understood this than use funi's translation :D}{Xemnas: Funi seems to have done a good job, since this looks fine. I think "Poppi" is slang for hip, or like "the in thing" and "Koi" means carp, so this works really well.}

388
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,310
Oh, shut up you! Do you even want to save Traf?!

389
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,490
We'll save Traf! I'll send Mingo flying!

390
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,670
And we don't have to worry about the Flame Fruit either.

391
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,880
But are you okay?

392
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,570
It seems Robin-san is somewhere in this country too.

393
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,640
I'd really like to see her again.

394
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:13,760
Revolutionary Army - Fishman Karate assistant instructor
Koala

395
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm glad you got to meet up with your friend.

396
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,080
Yeah... I thought he was going to hit me.

397
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,160
Are you crying?

398
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,960
As if!

399
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,560
Could you have made a difference if you were there?

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,870
Nobody can say for sure.

401
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,340
You're right.

402
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,780
Once you've figured out what's happening underground, tell me.

403
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,380
Of course.

404
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,200
In any case, I will get Ace's Flame Fruit.

405
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,840
We will carry on his will!

406
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,670
I did't thing he waz alive...

407
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,090
Who are you talking about?!

408
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
I thought...

409
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,170
h-h-he...

410
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,300
{\an8}The Straw Hats are Back

411
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,580
he died back then!
