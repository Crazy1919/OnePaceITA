He really took down Doflamingo!

1165
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,500
He did it!

1166
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,850
Dressrosa is saved!

1167
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,970
By a rubber ball!

1168
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,840
No, he isn't just some rubber ball.

1169
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,460
According to King Riku, he is...

1170
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,160
the pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

1171
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,620
Thank you, Straw Hat!

1172
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,180
No, wait a minute...

1173
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,800
His face looks scarier, and his body's rounder than the guy in the newspaper.

1174
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,660
Is that really him?

1175
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,460
Are you Straw Hat Luffy?

1176
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,680
Huh? Yeah.

1177
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,840
I heard he's like an eight-meter tall monster.

1178
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
This guy's four meters at most.

1179
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
Then he's a fake?

1180
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,220
Hey, rubber ball. Are you really the Straw Hat?

1181
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,560
You guys're bugging me!

1182
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Why do you keep bouncing up and down?

1183
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,280
Can't you stop?

1184
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,240
Nope.

1185
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,380
Hey, what was that?
I just heard something loud!

1186
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Viola?

1187
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Straw Hat...

1188
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,020
...won!

1189
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,860
Really?!

1190
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
Amazing!

1191
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,920
What destructive strength!
There's no way he's still alive!

1192
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,410
Hey. Look up, in the sky!

1193
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,620
No good!

1194
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,960
The bird cage isn't gone!

1195
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,280
Dammit! Just one more strike!

1196
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Rubber...

1197
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,040
Hey, what's the matter, Straw Hat Luffy?

1198
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,820
Jesus Burgess!
Why was he here at the Palace?!

1199
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,410
You're kidding me!

1200
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,680
He jumped down!
I can't believe how far he can jump!

1201
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Hello, Sabo-kun?

1202
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,720
Come in! Hello?!

1203
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
That Straw Hat bastard's half-dead!

1204
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Now's my chance!

1205
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,340
That's...

1206
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,000
The captain of the first ship of
Emperor Blackbeard's pirate crew...

1207
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,960
"Champion" Burgess!

1208
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,940
Just you wait!

1209
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,980
I'll kill you, then rob you of...

1210
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,620
the Rubber Fruit!

1211
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,570
Are you okay?

1212
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,460
Don't!

1213
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,880
Don't just walk right up to him. He's a pirate too!

1214
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,020
You never know what they're thinking.

1215
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,120
What a terrible thing to say!
He fought Doflamingo for us!

1216
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,810
She's right!

1217
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,740
At the very least, he's not our enemy.

1218
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,240
Still, I can't trust him!

1219
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
But...

1220
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,760
King Riku told us that he's our only hope!

1221
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,480
Hey, you! Is the battle over?

1222
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,160
What happened to Doflamingo?

1223
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,880
Doflamingo is still alive!

1224
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,870
Get away from the town!

1225
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,800
The fight between the pirates is still going on!

1226
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,650
We're gonna get caught up in it! Get outta here!

1227
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,740
Even downtown's in danger!

1228
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,520
The bird cage is closing in!
There's no place to run!

1229
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,910
Min... go...

1230
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,450
S-Straw Hat Luffy...

1231
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,190
H-he can't fight anymore...

1232
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,600
If you go near him, you'll get caught up in their fight and die! Don't get involved!

1233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,670
Get away from the pirate!

1234
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,330
Straw Hat the Pirate!

1235
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,260
Do you recognize me?

1236
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm Gatz!

1237
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,120
The announcer from the Colosseum, Gatz!

1238
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,430
The unknown gladiator, Lucy's true identity...

1239
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,520
was you, wasn't it?

1240
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,280
Y-yeah...

1241
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,950
I thought so!

1242
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,130
There aren't many small guys who are that strong!

1243
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,530
Doflamingo's on his way!

1244
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,870
What are you gonna do about your duel?

1245
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,670
Is there anything I can do?

1246
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,370
I need ten minutes...

1247
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,310
After I use Bound-Man,
I can't use Haki for ten minutes afterward.

1248
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,290
B-Boun...

1249
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,890
I gotta keep my distance,

1250
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,630
but I dunno what he's
gonna do during that time.

1251
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,450
If I can regain my Haki,

1252
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,010
I'm sure I can settle this in one blow!

1253
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,870
Then, his horrible reign will be over?

1254
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,310
Hey, if we give you ten minutes,
you'll free us from the bird cage, right?!

1255
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,310
Hey, Straw Hat!

1256
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,870
I promise!

1257
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,770
Alright!

1258
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,090
Ten minutes!
We'll leave it up to you guys!

1259
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,430
You can count on us!
Ten minutes'll pass by in a flash!

1260
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,560
You better come back quick
and bring down that damn Dofla, Lucy!

1261
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,190
We'll hang in there!

1262
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,230
They're all competitors from the tournament!

1263
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,750
The ones who wouldn't help you earlier!

1264
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,540
Sorry, Lucy!

1265
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,550
We were blinded by greed over the bounty on your heads!

1266
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,440
We didn't even dream that Doflamingo could be driven into a corner!

1267
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,390
Sorry!

1268
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,050
As a token of our apology,
we'll put our trust in you and risk our lives!

1269
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,190
If we happen to beat him first, sorry!

1270
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,080
Thanks for everything, Mr. Heavenly Yaksha!

1271
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,250
Why don't you hang out with us for a while?

1272
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,730
Here he comes, here he comes!

1273
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,060
Kick his ass!

1274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,730
Alright, now's our chance!

1275
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,260
The remaining half of you, follow me!

1276
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,260
Someone is...

1277
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,900
Die, Straw Hat!

1278
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,060
B-Burgess?!

1279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,940
Sabo!

1280
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,710
Th-That guy...

1281
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,930
Oh, the three-star outlaw!

1282
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,180
Wh-What?!

1283
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,640
The Revolutionary Army's Chief of Staff!

1284
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,060
I am Sabo of the Revolutionary Army!

1285
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,840
Straw Hat Luffy is my little brother!

1286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,150
Something you want from him, Burgess?

1287
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,580
Straw Hat is your brother?

1288
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720
I've heard that somewhere before.

1289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,820
Fire Fist Ace said the same thing, didn't he?
The three of us are brothers.

1290
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,760
After the duel on Banaro Island,
you, the Blackbeard Pirates, captured Ace.

1291
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,460
That was the trigger for that damnable Paramount War.

1292
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Ace lived his own life the way he chose to.
I'm not holding a grudge against you or anything...

1293
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,080
but I'm watching Luffy's back from now on!

1294
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,880
Remember that!

1295
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,840
I have no interest in your relationship to him!

1296
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,680
Don't get in my way. I've got no business with you or the Revolutionary Army!

1297
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,040
I only have business with...

1298
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,540
No business with me? Not even personally?

1299
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,000
I see. That was you.

1300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,620
Huh? Flame?

1301
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,300
Hey, Luffy.

1302
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
You've taken some real damage.

1303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,480
Doflamingo's on his way,
and I think my hands'll be full with Burgess.

1304
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,100
I'll be fine.

1305
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,510
Cats and the others will buy me some time.

1306
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,590
It's Gatz!

1307
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,020
I'll take down Mingo, no matter what!

1308
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,570
You've become so dependable!

1309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,790
Leave this one to me!

1310
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,840
Sabo.

1311
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,280
You ate Ace's Fruit, didn't you?

1312
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,610
I wouldn't let anybody else have it.
It's a memento of him!

1313
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,460
That's great!

1314
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,960
I'll be taking that power!

1315
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,450
Take care of him, Pets!

1316
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,580
It's Gatz, and I will!

1317
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,210
Galleon...

1318
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,080
Lariat!

1319
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,700
Burning Dragon Claw Fist!

1320
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
So hot!

1321
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,480
Flame Dragon King!

1322
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,530
C-Can't believe it! He blew away a subordinate of one of the Four Emperors!

1323
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,960
Powerful! That's what I'd expect from the Revolutionary Army's second-in-command!

1324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,460
As soon as he saw the Flame Fruit's power,
he changed his focus to me.

1325
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,920
So his objective is...

1326
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,380
...as they say.

1327
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,590
He's hunting down Devil Fruit users.

1328
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,690
Hey, Lucy! What gives?

1329
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,000
I thought you won the competition
and took the Flame Fruit...

1330
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,040
The Lucy in the finals wasn't me.

1331
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,850
I had somewhere to be, so Sabo took my place.

1332
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,910
Oh, so that's what happened.
That's against the rules!

1333
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,740
But it all worked out, yeah.

1334
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,420
Inheriting your late brother's ability makes for an exciting story.

1335
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,860
Well, whatever!

1336
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,760
In any case, your recovery is
the only hope Dressrosa has left!

1337
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,600
What's with that bastard?
He still has the energy to do this?

1338
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,240
Don't hesitate!
We gotta stall him as much as we can!

1339
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,130
Annoying weaklings!
I don't need any energy to wipe you out!

1340
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,260
Show yourself, Straw Hat!

1341
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,820
I'll make you regret everything.

1342
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,960
Straw Hat!

1343
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,560
That bastard, Doflamingo!
He'll go to any length!

1344
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,670
What else is he gonna do?!

1345
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,800
First he made the bird cage, and now he's turning the town into strings!

1346
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,100
Dressrosa is done for!

1347
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,060
Just run! The only way to survive
is to get away from the downtown area!

1348
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,340
The whole area's a war zone!
If you get caught up in it, you're dead meat!

1349
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm not gonna get cut up by that bird cage crap!

1350
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,120
Hurry toward the downtown area!

1351
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,430
Hey, don't push!

1352
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,400
Watch out! I'm gonna get crushed!

1353
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,280
I have children!

1354
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,030
Stop! Stop!

1355
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,110
Hey, why're you running in the opposite direction?! We gotta get to the downtown area!

1356
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,260
Downtown's a war zone now!

1357
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,120
What?!

1358
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,290
What? Then...

1359
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,160
Where do we run?!

1360
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,080
King Riku, what are we supposed to do?

1361
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Armament...

1362
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,330
What are you doing, Zoro-dono?
Trying to stop it with your swords?!

1363
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,940
It is not something you can stop by merely pushing!

1364
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,280
How would you know?

1365
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,580
If you have time to jabber on that it's impossible, then gimme a hand, you slow-ass idiots!

1366
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,900
It's just one person's ability!

1367
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,280
There's no real reason for me to believe I can't stop it!

1368
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
Shall we, Kin'emon?

1369
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,100
We shall!

1370
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,850
In Front of the Smile Factory

1371
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,100
You ready?!

1372
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,670
We are!

1373
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,300
The factory's made of Sea Stone!
It can't be damaged!

1374
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,380
Let me see that freakish strength of yours!

1375
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,500
Alright! Ready!

1376
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,260
Push the factory!

1377
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,260
Push, push!

1378
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,080
Push!

1379
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,490
Not yet, not yet! Push, push!

1380
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,320
Push!

1381
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,430
Royal Palace Grounds - Level 2

1382
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,120
Zoro and the others are pushing against the bird cage?

1383
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,660
Yes.

1384
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,840
Is it even possible to stop it?

1385
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,900
I don't know. I would have never thought of it.

1386
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,320
Roger! That's so like him.

1387
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,000
Royal Palace Grounds
South Side

1388
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,890
This is the will of the young master!

1389
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,920
What?! Get out of our way!

1390
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,060
How rude.

1391
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,590
Come no closer!
These are the New Royal Grounds!

1392
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,620
Only members of the Donquixote Family may enter!

1393
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,450
What "Family"? Even the commanders are gone!

1394
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,400
But this is the safest place to be! Let us climb up!

1395
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,740
Shut up! You damn fools are condemned criminals!

1396
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,820
The young master has decreed that
this country will be completely cleansed!

1397
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,720
Barrier...

1398
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,770
Pistol!

1399
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,200
Outta our way, left-overs!

1400
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,260
It's the fighters from the Colosseum!

1401
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,200
Bartolomeo!

1402
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,540
Hajrudin!

1403
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,380
Don Chinjao!

1404
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,340
Army Commander Kyros is here, too!

1405
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,320
How am I able to move?

1406
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,730
I'm wondering the same thing.
I didn't think I could move with those injuries.

1407
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,580
Don't let your guard down just yet!

1408
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,210
By decision of Princess Mansherry,
Dressrosa has been placed on life support!

1409
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,400
Life support?

1410
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
What do you mean, dwarf?

1411
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,100
In any case, everybody!
Claw your way to the plateau!

1412
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,590
The center of the bird cage is moving this way!

1413
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,830
Hooray!

1414
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,020
You saved us, Kyros-sama!

1415
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,440
Hey, men don't depend on others!

1416
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Those of you who are able-bodied, come with us!

1417
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,100
Huh? "Come with me"?!

1418
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,430
Hey, where're ya going?!

1419
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,930
Doflamingo!

1420
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,400
If he's not gonna come out,
I'm gonna make him come out!

1421
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,740
Hey, that's...

1422
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,080
Isn't it moving faster than before?!

1423
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,850
No doubt about it!

1424
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,240
The bird cage is closing in even faster!

1425
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,400
Please save us, Your Majesty!

1426
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,160
We're not gonna make it!

1427
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,860
Stop it, Doflamingo!

1428
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,520
We won't make it!

1429
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,240
Push! Put more power into it!

1430
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,380
Come on!

1431
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,940
Push!

1432
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,960
Push!

1433
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,920
What's the matter?

1434
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,400
We're being pushed back!

1435
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,180
It's speeding up... Don't let it get the better of you!

1436
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,930
Push harder than you've ever pushed before!

1437
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay!

1438
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,410
Push!

1439
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,540
Push!

1440
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,950
Alright, now's our chance to show off!

1441
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,920
Yeah!

1442
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,340
Come on out, Straw Hat...

1443
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,460
Help us!

1444
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,200
Hurry! It's shrinking faster!

1445
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,480
{\an8}Three minutes remain until the bird cage reaches the downtown area and the blood bath begins.

1446
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,500
You've gotta be kidding!

1447
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,420
We won't make it in time!

1448
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,300
{\an8}Four minutes remain until
Luffy's Haki is regained.

1449
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,100
{\an8}This leaves a one minute difference between the moment the bird cage closes completely
and the moment Luffy awakens.
