00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,400
Before the Palace Steps

1165
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
I am listening!

1166
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,680
Don't lie! You're not listening at all!

1167
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
You've been absent-minded the whole time!

1168
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Look! You have a position now!

1169
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,280
You can't get emotional and fight a guy like the Navy admiral!

1170
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
Do you wanna lead the Revolutionary Army into war?

1171
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,840
My brother's in danger! I don't care!

1172
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,780
You should!

1173
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,700
Nah!

1174
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't wanna get dragged into a mess by your recklessness!

1175
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,500
Scrwew iwt!

1176
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,240
What?!

1177
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,040
An' dat guy is...

1178
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,540
We are birds of a feather.

1179
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,200
We Navy and Doflamingo are both out of place.

1180
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
The Navy will never be a hero in this country.

1181
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,740
If somebody notices that's what you're thinking...

1182
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,460
No.

1183
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,080
I was just being blocked by you...

1184
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,940
It's like a gamble.

1185
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm sort of a lucky man.

1186
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay?!
Understood?! Were you listening?!

1187
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,960
Sabo-kun?!

1188
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,420
Come on!

1189
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,120
Hack and I always get chewed out because of your selfish actions!

1190
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,450
Former Royal Plateau

1191
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,340
We'll lure the other criminals using these criminals.

1192
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,860
I'm sorry!

1193
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,780
I really am!

1194
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,820
No! Help!

1195
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,460
What?

1196
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh! I'm free!

1197
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,660
Guys, is it okay to release us?

1198
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
We shouldn't have done that.

1199
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,980
For a decade, we were holding a grudge against King Riku-sama who was just

1200
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,900
manipulated by Doflamingo for one night.

1201
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,680
We praised the king who was a pirate...

1202
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,380
And even after we learned the truth...

1203
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,900
And even after we learned the truth...!

1204
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,540
We were still looking for salvation in the game he started!

1205
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,200
We don't even know what we're doing anymore...

1206
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,420
What's gonna happen to this country, King Riku-sama?!

1207
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
Please save us!

1208
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,260
Wh-What the...

1209
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,620
What happened to them?!

1210
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
What's going on?!

1211
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,860
King Riku-sama!
What are we supposed to do?!

1212
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,180
If you tell us to fight, we'll take up arms!

1213
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,400
King Riku-sama!

1214
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,420
We'll follow you!

1215
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,720
Shall we wait... for a while?

1216
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,460
What? Wait?

1217
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,780
It won't be too late to choose death.

1218
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,100
I have been believing in Luffy-kun and the others' victory without realizing...

1219
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,240
Dressrosa was once the symbol of peace.

1220
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,820
I won't let you get involved in a war.

1221
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,200
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why the hell is he here?!

1222
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,740
King Riku, sir.

1223
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm betting on the same one as you.

1224
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,960
On the "Straw".

1225
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,200
Royal Palace Steps

1226
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,630
4th Step

1227
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,870
Top Floor of the Palace

1228
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,540
How do you like that, bastard?!

1229
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,880
That was quite a blow!

1230
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,840
See?! It didn't kill him!

1231
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,800
That strategy will never work again!

1232
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,900
I have no business with the fake-mingo!

1233
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,820
Law! I know all about your ability!

1234
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,900
Because the ability of the Operation Fruit was something we sought in the first place!

1235
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Even if I got chopped up, I'm gonna turn back to normal!

1236
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,800
Ready to fight back!

1237
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,720
Oh?

1238
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,260
Radio Knife is a different cutting method
from my regular Amputation.

1239
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,900
For several minutes, even with any treatment or ability, your body...

1240
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,580
...can't be reassembled!

1241
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,780
What?! I'm in trouble!

1242
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Can't help my nose running!

1243
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,780
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1244
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Damn!

1245
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,520
Room!

1246
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Stop! You traitor!

1247
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,180
Injection!

1248
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,360
Take this!

1249
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,160
Snot Blade-Catcher!

1250
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,720
Shot!

1251
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,860
Here's the finisher!

1252
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,340
Fullbright!

1253
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,340
Tra-guy!

1254
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,400
Do you remember what I hate the most, Law?

1255
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,170
To be looked down upon!

1256
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,500
Tra-guy!

1257
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,080
Get away!

1258
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,580
Get away, Straw Hat!

1259
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,720
Dodge!

1260
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,460
Bellamy...

1261
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,000
Dammit!!

1262
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,120
Straw Hatter!

1263
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,980
Did you think you could take me down?

1264
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,920
The fact that shitty brats like you guys got conceited

1265
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,860
and thought even for a second, that you could defeat me is...

1266
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,760
...an unbearable humiliation to me!

1267
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,320
Listen.

1268
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,460
I'm a descendent of the noblest bloodlines in the world...

1269
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,800
The Celestial Dragon!

1270
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,940
What?!

1271
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,760
We're admirable just by the fact of our birth.

1272
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,680
I used to possess the most unobtainable power in the world.

1273
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,800
However...

1274
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,540
One day, my father abandoned the greatest power in the world

1275
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,800
that we were born with

1276
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,820
and the four of us in the family...

1277
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,320
...descended to this manure-pile world!

1278
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Screw that "live like human-beings" bull!

1279
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,660
My father was an idiotic man!

1280
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,260
Father! Where are the slaves-eh?!
Let's go buy some-eh!

1281
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,540
Father, why don't they fall down on their knees-eh?

1282
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,280
Father! Why do they come after us-eh?!

1283
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,820
They're a Celestial Dragon family!

1284
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,780
Don't kill them... Make them suffer for the rest of their lives!

1285
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,500
By the age of ten,
I'd seen heaven and hell on earth.

1286
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
Then, I killed my father
who caused all that

1287
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,660
and returned to Mariejois with his head!

1288
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,640
But...

1289
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,300
...the Celestial Dragons in heaven would never accept a renegade family!

1290
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,260
I knew there was no way to get out of this hell.

1291
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,280
At that time I swore...

1292
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,340
I will destroy every single thing in the world...

1293
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,600
that they dominate!

1294
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,360
The life I've lived is on a very different level from yours!

1295
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,220
I have no time to play around...

1296
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,560
...with you brats!

1297
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,970
The Northwestern Town - Primula

1298
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
D-Don't do it! I'm begging you!

1299
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,260
Please!

1300
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't wanna do this!

1301
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,320
But I can't... I can't control my body!

1302
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,080
Sorry! I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

1303
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,800
With this much stuff, we can rebuild our ship-yashi!

1304
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
Deshi, deshi!

1305
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,780
Wait, damn pirates!

1306
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,200
What're you guys doing under the cover of fire?!

1307
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
I won't let you get away!

1308
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,580
It's gonna die if we don't stop it!

1309
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,280
Tranquilizer bullets!
Do we still have any?!

1310
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,200
We're short of tranquilizer bullets as well as soldiers.

1311
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,800
What should we do?

1312
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,840
If nothing is done...

1313
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,080
Vice Admiral Maynard!

1314
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,700
What is it?

1315
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,100
The fight between Sabo of the Revolutionary Army and Issho-san in Acacia,

1316
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
winded up in a draw due to injury!

1317
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,840
What?! Don't be silly!

1318
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,220
The admirals from HQ are the Navy's greatest military powers!

1319
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,700
Why, Issho-san?!

1320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,580
Does the World Government...

1321
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,820
...pretend to be God or something?!

1322
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,180
Those words... hang over my head...

1323
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,580
What should we do?!

1324
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,920
But now isn't the time to think about it!

1325
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,080
We'll deal with the pirates that headed for Doflamingo later!

1326
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,840
In any event, we'll keep trying to bring
the nationwide confusion under control!

1327
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,680
Do your best not to harm any citizens or animals!

1328
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,600
Sedate those who are out of control with tranquilizer bullets!

1329
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,680
Are you okay?

1330
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,080
Royal Palace

1331
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1332
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
Rubber...

1333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
Octopus Stamp!

1334
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,640
That was close!

1335
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Behind you!

1336
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,720
You guys have no idea...

1337
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,480
Can you imagine what people would do to a fallen Celestial Dragon?

1338
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,920
People are all...

1339
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,080
Cruel.

1340
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,740
What are you talking about,
Fake-mingo?!

1341
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,120
All right then,
let's begin with the executions.

1342
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,160
You're the first, Law...

1343
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,180
Hey!

1344
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
There's something not quite clear to me.

1345
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,760
Hmm?

1346
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,780
You're a former Celestial Dragon, expelled from Mariejois.

1347
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,780
How do you still hold that much power?

1348
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,810
CP-0 works directly under the command of the World Government, but you brought them into action this morning!

1349
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,960
Do you still wish to know that
even though you're going to die soon?

1350
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,360
It's because I know about the important national treasure...

1351
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,880
...that they have inside The Holyland of Mariejois!

1352
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,220
The national treasure in Mariejois?

1353
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,520
Yes.

1354
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,540
It's something that could shake the world by its very existence.

1355
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,400
Kill Doflamingo-eh!

1356
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,640
We can't keep that kid alive-eh!

1357
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,940
To them, I'm an escapee who has the most dangerous card to play.

1358
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,680
They tried to kill me, but I didn't die, so the Celestial Dragons became very cooperative.

1359
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Plus, if I could have had your Operation Fruit power in my hands that day,

1360
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,280
I would have taken the helm of the world utilizing the national treasure in Mariejois!

1361
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,880
Your power has such value.

1362
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,200
As well as the "Personality Transplant Surgery,"
there's another usage!

1363
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,740
Do you know about it?

1364
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,220
If a wise man utilizes the Operation Fruit, even the dream people have had since ancient times could come true.

1365
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,080
That's why quite a lot of people call it the ultimate Devil Fruit.

1366
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,440
Yeah, I know...

1367
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,900
Even though I have no interest in it.

1368
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,040
The greatest power of this fruit is to grant another person eternal life...

1369
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
...via the "Perpetual Youth Surgery"!

1370
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,640
But once it's performed,
the surgeon himself will die.

1371
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Indeed!

1372
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,660
That's why I wasn't gonna let you eat it!

1373
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,260
How dare you repay kindness with ingratitude!

1374
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,660
Oh, I'm sorry!

1375
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,220
Diamante's swordplay!

1376
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Bullet String!

1377
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,220
Lao G's martial art!

1378
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
Room!

1379
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,620
Injection Shot!

1380
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,300
Gladius's gunnery!

1381
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,260
You got all your fighting skills from us!

1382
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,240
Yeah!

1383
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,100
And I'm still here thanks to Cora-san!

1384
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm grateful!

1385
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,200
Because I can take you all down with this power!

1386
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:26,670
16 years ago, North Blue
Port Town Spider Miles

1387
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,730
Are you serious?

1388
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,450
Donquixote Family
♦Executives♣
Diamante & Trebol

1389
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,900
Stop laughing! I'm serious!

1390
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,140
You can't kill a person
just with your spirit!

1391
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,740
I told you! I have explosives!

1392
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,880
Don't mess with pirates!

1393
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,110
Waste Processing Plant

1394
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,530
Wait! Wait, wait!

1395
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,230
No-dasuyan!

1396
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,240
Where's the captain?

1397
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,060
Wait!

1398
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,490
Our captain Doffy doesn't have time for a kid like you.

1399
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,130
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

1400
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,390
We understand you can't live long and that you'll die soon.

1401
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,950
When? Hey, hey!
When are you gonna die?

1402
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,110
Three years and two months from now.

1403
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,190
A doctor said so?

1404
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,470
My dead father was a doctor.
I found out by seeing my medical data.

1405
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,930
What a smart brat.

1406
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,340
I wanna kill as many as I can in these three years!

1407
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,430
And destroy everything!

1408
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,090
He must have a screw loose!

1409
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,340
Can't help my nose running!

1410
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,910
Well, we accept kids, too.

1411
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,930
We had about hundred kids come until now,

1412
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,430
but most of them escaped crying within two days.

1413
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,710
Are you gonna be okay?

1414
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,570
Nin! Trebol-sama!

1415
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,530
Diamante-sama!

1416
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,290
They're the only kids remaining.

1417
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,370
What is it? Buffalo? Baby 5?

1418
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,550
Cora-san came back!

1419
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,570
He tripped!

1420
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,030
We knew he was gonna trip-dasuyan!

1421
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,790
You tripped! You tripped!

1422
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,790
Dasuyan! Dasuyan!

1423
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,170
Dasuyan...

1424
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,310
Cora-san, I brought you a cup of tea.

1425
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,110
It's hot.

1426
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,630
Corazón, did you finish your work without any trouble?

1427
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,570
Then, give me the earnings.
We have to be faithful when it comes to money.

1428
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,810
Your name is Law, isn't it?

1429
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,690
This guy who just returned is an Executive like us.

1430
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:27,550
Donquixote Family ♥ Executive
Corazón

1431
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,990
His name is Corazón.

1432
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,690
He's an absent-minded idiot, but...

1433
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,190
...he's strong, maybe because of his blood.

1434
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,450
Captain Doffy's brother by blood.

1435
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,830
He can't speak because of a traumatic event in his past, I heard.

1436
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,070
In addition...

1437
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,110
He doesn't like kids. Be careful.

1438
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,750
What the...?!

1439
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,190
Oh, he's dead!

1440
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,490
He crashed into the mountain of scrap metal-dasuyan!

1441
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,790
What's wrong with him?! He must be nuts!

1442
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,390
I'm gonna kill him!!
