00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,130
Then, I'll leave that guy up to you, soldier!

1165
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,100
Roger that!

1166
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,180
Let's go, Straw Hatter.

1167
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,860
Oh yeah, Rebecca!

1168
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
How nice that you got to see your dad!

1169
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,200
Thanks for the key!

1170
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
See ya!

1171
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,860
Hey, Lucy!

1172
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,520
Are you really going to...

1173
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,490
Are you really going to take down Doflamingo?!

1174
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,460
It ain't "Lucy".

1175
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,980
Name's Luffy!
The man who's gonna be the Pirate King!

1176
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,220
So don't worry!

1177
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,550
Pirate King?!

1178
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm your opponent, Diamante!

1179
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,860
Do you seriously think
I'll let you reach the palace?!

1180
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,270
You tremendous idiot!
And the traitorous brat!

1181
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,800
Room!

1182
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,140
Chambres!

1183
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,880
Dammit!

1184
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,150
Royal palace















Pool courtyard

1185
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,590
Is this... the palace?

1186
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeah, we finally made it.

1187
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,160
What a useful ability!

1188
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,980
It is, but it also eats up my energy.

1189
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,420
I suppose having those sea stone cuffs on and getting carried by you to this point wasn't so bad after all.

1190
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
I was able to save my energy.

1191
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,940
Scalpel!

1192
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,440
What's wrong?

1193
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,660
I operated on myself.

1194
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,360
He purposely used lead bullets...
That bastard!

1195
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,800
Alright! Let's go kick Mingo's ass!

1196
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
Wait!

1197
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,670
What now?!

1198
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,860
Doflamingo isn't someone that you can just beat with willpower alone.

1199
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,820
You need to cool down.

1200
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,300
What?!
How can I "cool down" after coming this far?!

1201
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,900
I'm telling you, if you don't, you can't defeat him!

1202
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,500
I promised Rebecca!

1203
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,600
What good will standing still here do us?!

1204
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,060
Law and Straw Hat have shown up in the yard, near the pool.

1205
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,300
Roger that.

1206
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,490
Ten years... Ten whole years...

1207
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,980
I spent such a long time adding to my collection, little by little.

1208
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,440
Tens of thousands of toy slaves!

1209
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,440
But that idiot...

1210
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,880
Brought it all to naught in an instant!

1211
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,650
Getting revenge will be easy.

1212
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,580
I just have to touch him.

1213
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,420
Straw Hats...

1214
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll make it so that...

1215
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,040
all of you...

1216
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,600
never existed!

1217
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,140
Former Royal Plateau

1218
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,830
This is bad!

1219
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,170
Usopp-dono, is it that serious of a problem?!

1220
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,590
It sent chills down my spine...

1221
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,950
To think about how Robin was turned into a toy earlier!

1222
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,520
I didn't even realize I had forgotten about her!

1223
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,480
If Sugar touches Luffy, I'll forget about him like that!

1224
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,660
Your friend disappears, and you won't even know it!

1225
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,670
I can't take it!

1226
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,630
I won't let that happen!

1227
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,700
Can't we tell them through the Snail Phone?

1228
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,070
I've been calling them, but they haven't noticed!

1229
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't have a choice!

1230
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,320
I'll just shoot her from here!

1231
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,340
But, Usopp-dono, shooting her from here would be...

1232
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,180
Impossible!

1233
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,990
I can barely see the palace with my naked eye.

1234
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,590
And the enemy is behind the wall.
I can't even see her!

1235
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,460
No matter how hard it is, I've gotta do it!

1236
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,230
We'll assist you!

1237
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,980
I'm a sniper!

1238
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,020
Covering someone is what I do best!

1239
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,050
Protecting my friends by shooting enemies from a distance!

1240
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,260
Captain Tank! Hack!

1241
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes, my king!

1242
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,820
Give me a hand! We'll protect Usopp-kun!

1243
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,340
Father!

1244
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,560
The citizens are nearly here.

1245
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,730
Everybody's confused.

1246
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,270
They may come after me, too.

1247
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,270
But don't harm anyone.

1248
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,870
That might be difficult.

1249
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,140
All we need to do now is buy time for the shot.

1250
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,980
I owe you one, old king!

1251
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Usopp-kun.

1252
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,780
Sugar is getting closer!

1253
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,960
She can see them.

1254
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,360
Keep your eye on her!

1255
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,530
Made it!

1256
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,490
There!

1257
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,830
King Riku!

1258
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
Viola-sama!

1259
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,770
Kin'emon!

1260
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,270
God Usopp!

1261
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,270
Seize them all and hand them over to Doflamingo!

1262
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,010
We must assist as well!

1263
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,510
Yes!

1264
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,020
What the...

1265
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,290
Sugar came out into the yard!

1266
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,500
The time has come!

1267
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,390
Everyone, listen!  None of us will run!

1268
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,140
Stop right there!

1269
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,870
Father!

1270
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,100
Stay focused!

1271
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,640
I-I'm sorry!

1272
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Tell me the exact location of the courtyard!

1273
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,910
People, come to your senses!

1274
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,680
See the windows on the upper part of the Rampart Tower?

1275
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,380
Yeah.

1276
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,680
I see Straw Hat and Law in the first window right of the center.

1277
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
There are iron bars on the window.

1278
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,830
How many bars are there?

1279
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,770
One vertical bar and three horizontal bars.

1280
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,140
The length from the ground of the yard to the bottom of the window is about 1.2 meters.

1281
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,800
That's about Sugar's height.

1282
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,610
How big is the bottom pane of the window?

1283
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,520
50 wide by 40 high.

1284
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,260
She'll be able to touch them at any second!

1285
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,220
The target is behind that wall...

1286
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,870
If I miss, we'll lose Luffy!

1287
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,060
Hey, Luffy!

1288
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,520
I'd never want to sail an ocean without you on it!

1289
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,120
Who will save this country?!

1290
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
You just watch, Sugar!

1291
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,450
I won't let you guys...

1292
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,460
have it your way!

1293
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,130
What's... going on?

1294
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,070
I can see...

1295
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,980
their presences!

1296
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,750
There's Luffy!

1297
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,510
Here I go!

1298
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,290
Super Grow Up Great Black Kabuto!

1299
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,990
Sure-Kill Long-Range Bagworm!

1300
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,880
The wind is blowing from west to east...

1301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,820
Wind force: Four.

1302
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,620
A slight tailwind.

1303
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,120
We got him!

1304
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,520
Two...

1305
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,340
One...

1306
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,870
First booster, Exploding Star!

1307
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,800
It ascends slightly, and the back is jettisoned.

1308
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Two seconds later, the second booster ignites!

1309
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,940
The outer cover comes off and the bullet travels horizontally.

1310
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,940
It'll pass through the lower left side of the window on the Rampart Tower!

1311
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,760
Through the wall, straight on!

1312
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,850
Straight to the target!

1313
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,910
What?

1314
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,660
It trails off a little, but this special round is...

1315
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,440
Designed to re-traumatize the enemy!

1316
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,710
Luffy, you don't even have to notice...

1317
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
As long as you're alright,

1318
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,280
just ignore it and carry on!

1319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,970
But, Usopp-dono, what are you
planning to do with this drawing?

1320
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,670
Can you turn it into a doll?

1321
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,630
A doll?

1322
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,880
Do it! This'll be my bullet!

1323
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,500
Sugar-sama!

1324
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,530
Oh no! She passed out again!

1325
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,020
Incredible, Usopp-kun!
You're unbelievable!

1326
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,860
Viola-sama?

1327
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,950
You did it! You brought down Sugar!

1328
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,560
Did he really?! I can't believe it!

1329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,380
I am truly stunned!

1330
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,160
Did he really prevail?!

1331
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,900
Great...

1332
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,650
How are they?

1333
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,200
They're both fine.

1334
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,240
They've just made it!

1335
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,120
To the top floor of the palace, the stage for the final battle!

1336
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,790
I see.

1337
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,620
You did it, Luffy!

1338
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,090
I suppose I should ask...

1339
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,600
Just in case I'm wrong...

1340
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,110
What...

1341
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,400
did you two come here for?

1342
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,270
To kick your ass!

1343
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,010
Likewise!

1344
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm disappointed.

1345
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,880
3rd step


















New Royal Plateau

1346
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,830
What?!

1347
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,590
Why are they just falling apart?!

1348
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,490
The toys...

1349
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,960
I thought they were big for toys.

1350
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,140
So each of them was put together from eight people.

1351
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,770
They turned their own men into toys?!

1352
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,480
Just how little do they value their soldiers?!

1353
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,860
Impossible...

1354
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Sugar fainted again?!

1355
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,880
Sugar-sama!

1356
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,650
Sugar-sama, stay with us!

1357
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,450
Sugar-sama!

1358
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,390
It was terrible!

1359
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,880
We thought we'd be toys forever.

1360
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,500
Don't be silly.

1361
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,730
We planned to return you to normal once the battle was over, of course.

1362
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,570
Th-That's what I thought!

1363
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,120
What a relief!

1364
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,320
That's reassuring.

1365
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,080
Of course, we completely forgot about them.

1366
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,110
Alright!

1367
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,350
My barrier is fully recharged!

1368
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,850
I won't let you guys ascend any farther!

1369
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:46,580
The Top Floor of the Royal Palace

1370
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,500
Bellamy!

1371
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,170
Why so concerned?

1372
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,140
I thought you two clashed in Mock Town.

1373
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,180
When did you two become friends?

1374
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,220
You're such a delusional dumbass!

1375
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,160
Listen up!
The era where pirates dream is over!

1376
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,480
That's all in the past.

1377
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,830
Let Bellamy go!

1378
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,040
That's...

1379
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,080
up to the winner to decide!

1380
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,190
This fool came to me to get killed.

1381
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:47,160
In order to survive the coming wave, I'm gonna ride on Doflamingo's ship.

1382
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,760
I won't laugh at you anymore.

1383
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,500
I've looked up to Doflamingo ever since I was a kid.

1384
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,620
I have too much respect for him.

1385
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,110
This is how you take responsibility, isn't it?

1386
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,080
Bellamy.

1387
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,160
You idolized me of your own will...

1388
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,190
And became desperate when things didn't go as you'd hoped.

1389
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,920
People can't change their nature.

1390
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,700
No matter how far you go, you're just a cheap thug.

1391
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,520
Bellamy!

1392
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,740
What are you saying?!
Bellamy has changed!

1393
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,800
It's okay now.

1394
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,140
Just...

1395
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,070
kill me...

1396
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
already...

1397
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,070
Hey, Straw Hatter!

1398
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,310
Let go of Bellamy!

1399
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,370
Mingo!

1400
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,440
Sorry, Bellamy!

1401
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,820
Didn't we agree on this earlier?

1402
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,860
Straw Hatter!

1403
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,820
If you get carried away by anger and hate, you're playing right into his hands.

1404
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,130
Suppress it!

1405
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,160
Getting us riled up is his plan.

1406
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,210
Losing your cool here could get you killed.

1407
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,840
Like I almost did when I fought him previously.

1408
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,220
Doflamingo is a cold-blooded, ruthless man.

1409
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,360
He's always looking for a chance to get you!

1410
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,100
The face of your dying friend...

1411
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,010
You kicked him!
Didn't you? Yes!

1412
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,020
You just kicked him!

1413
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,820
You idiot!

1414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
What did you say?!

1415
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,380
Don't listen to him!

1416
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,470
How dare you say I'm cold-blooded!

1417
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,580
Law, I'm not as cold-blooded as you think.

1418
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,330
I've actually reached my boiling point.

1419
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,640
Think about what you guys have done.

1420
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,210
First, you began by destroying the SAD manufacturing machine on Punk Hazard.

1421
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,130
Then, you took out Vergo and Monet...

1422
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,330
And kidnapped Caesar.

1423
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,060
Lastly, you freed the toys throughout the country of Dressrosa.

1424
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,820
Even now, your associates are trying to destroy the Smile factory!

1425
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,160
Enough is enough already!

1426
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm smiling because I can't be any more pissed!

1427
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,230
And what's worse, you think you can actually kill me.

1428
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,460
It's been disastrous since you guys came along.

1429
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:57,100
It feels like I'm reliving the despair of thirteen years ago!

1430
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,160
If that hadn't happened,
I wouldn't have shown up in front of you like this!

1431
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:14,290
If that hadn't happened,
you would've been here as the third Corazón!

1432
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,290
Black Knight!

1433
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,980
The clone again?!

1434
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,390
Then, I will...

1435
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,980
Fight the real one!

1436
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,670
Bellamy!

1437
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,180
Hey, why're you doing this, Bellamy?!

1438
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,450
I said sorry for what I did!

1439
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,350
Straw Hatter!

1440
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,110
He's being controlled!

1441
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,410
I'm sorry, Straw Hat...

1442
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,970
Please...

1443
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,130
Stop me!

1444
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,580
I don't know how you know him but...

1445
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,170
If you wanna stop him, you gotta knock him out!

1446
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,570
Just do it! Straw Hat!

1447
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,390
I can't do that!

1448
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,940
You're my friend!

1449
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,830
You're already one foot in the grave.

1450
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,490
Not a bad way to die, huh?

1451
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you remember what I once told you, Law?

1452
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,680
The weak have no choice in how they die!

1453
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,790
That bastard!

1454
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,680
We came this far, but you still won't fight us yourself?!

1455
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,270
Traf!

1456
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,950
I'm gonna kick his ass now!

1457
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,020
I'm pissed off!

1458
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,190
Damn fool! I told you, it's our secret plan!

1459
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,380
And I told you not to get carried away!

1460
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,990
Screw that!

1461
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,990
Rubber...

1462
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,750
You fool!

1463
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,200
You'll pay for this!

1464
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,270
He's going to attack Law!

1465
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,870
Are you going nuts, Straw Hat?!

1466
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,340
This is fun!

1467
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,700
Room!

1468
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,940
Chambres!

1469
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,590
Red Hawk!

1470
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,660
Doffy!

1471
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,560
Radio Knife.

1472
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,520
Straw Hatter! You're the worst!

1473
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,070
Same to you...

1474
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,710
We're from that generation!
