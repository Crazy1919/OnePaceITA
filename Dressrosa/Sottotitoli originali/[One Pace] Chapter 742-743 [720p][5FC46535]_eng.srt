Keep pushing forward!

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

Spread open the chart of your dreams!

There's power hidden in the bond between us,

26

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

27

Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,910
Kyros is fighting the mysterious gladiator, Ricky, who appeared out of nowhere!

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,680
Kyros wins!

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
After nine years, he has finally won three thousand consecutive fights! He is undefeated!

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,390
Kyros, the living legend, is the very definition of the word "invincible"!

33
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,500
Why did you fight without telling me...

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,630
King Riku?

35
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,170
I wanted to teach you a lesson. I was quite strong, wasn't I?

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,680
That said, you held back knowing it was me.
You're a failure as a beast.

37
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,680
Isn't this enough?

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,850
You've kept your own life locked away in this cage for nine years.

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,690
Dressrosa in Turmoil

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,660
Come out. There's a job I want to entrust to you.

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,930
Kyros, rather than regretting your past, you can move on and protect lives.

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,030
Isn't that a better way of life?

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes!

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,520
Kyros, we're counting on you!

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,820
One year later

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,420
Kyros, thank you for all you do!

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,590
Dressrosa's Riku Royal Army Captain
Kyros (25 years old)

48
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,920
Kyros-sama!

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,700
You're quite popular, huh, Kyros-sama?

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,370
But you're still a murderer.

51
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,470
I can't fathom why my father would let you into the palace!

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,920
P-Princess!

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Sister, don't bring up his old scars!

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,620
And then he makes you the captain of the army, with the job of upholding the law...

55
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,110
He must be crazy!

56
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,510
Sister...

57
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,820
{\an8}You may have the rest of the country fooled, but not me!

Crown Princess of Dressrosa
Scarlett (Fifteen years old)

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,950
Someday, I'll expose you for what you really are!

60
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,430
Stay away from us! Do you understand?{ So much text over text. Changed "me and my sister" to just "us" so it would be one line. -Btwb }

61
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,600
But Sister, he's actually really...

62
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,300
Second in line (Younger sister)
Viola (Ten years old)

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,670
Hey, don't look!

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,770
His mind is obviously filthy!

65
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,770
But... I'm supposed to protect you...

66
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,510
No, thank you.

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
Scarlett-sama has been kidnapped!

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
It's pirates!

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,780
What happened to her escorts?

70
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,080
They've all been killed!

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
What?!

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,450
This is awful!

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,230
I-I'm so, so sorry!

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,930
I didn't mean to touch you!

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,470
Kyros! I was so scared!

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,510
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,680
She's cooking?

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,780
What brought this about?

79
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,120
Oh, I couldn't...

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,070
What?! You resign as my daughters' bodyguard?

81
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,100
You couldn't be in love with Scarlett, could you?

82
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,940
What?!

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,570
N-No, of course not. Never!

84
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:04,060
Some of the citizens might give you their blessings, but this goes against the country's ethics.

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,690
That's just what the general masses are like.

86
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,390
Father! If I can't marry him, then...

87
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,460
I will die!

88
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,320
Scarlett-sama!

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,010
She died of a sudden illness. I'm sure she would have made a wonderful queen someday.

90
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,410
Scarlett.

91
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,680
Starting today, you are no longer a princess.

92
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,920
Society believes you are dead.

93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,220
Yes.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,330
I feel like I'm disrespecting all you've done for me, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,830
Indeed, this is unforgivable...

96
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,270
Or it would be, for anyone but you.

97
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,740
Kyros, this is completely unheard of.

98
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,350
Her name will be Rebecca.

99
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,780
Kyros, hold her.

100
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,380
She's your daughter.

101
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,450
I can't touch something so pure!

102
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,360
My hands are filthy! I don't want to corrupt her!

103
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,700
What a funny father you have, Rebecca.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,170
Rebecca, you're like an angel.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,710
I'll be with you. I'll always watch over you! {I actually flipped the order of sentences around here, but seeing how he uses the phrasing "itsudemo kimi no soba ni iru" here, which (despite actually meaning "I will always be beside you") has been previously translated as "...will always watch over you", I wanted to maintain consistency and such. So note Xemnas, this is entirely intentional. Do not change. -Starfish}

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm your grandpa!

107
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,520
Grandpa!

108
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
Rebecca, how you've grown!

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,250
Father, will you take that mask off?

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,550
Kyros.

111
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,350
Gloves! I need my gloves!

112
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,360
You're such a cutie...

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,660
You're crying again.

114
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,810
The royal palace... it's burning. {Copy-paste from 651}{ I know this has been seen before, but it seems weird to have two Flashback styled lines while the rest of the line in the same scene are Main. -Btwb }

115
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,080
What's happening to this country? {End copy-paste from 651}

116
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
I'll go to the palace.

117
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,180
Scarlett, Rebecca, listen to me.

118
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,450
Father?

119
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,920
If the danger reaches here,
then wait for me at the red flower field.

120
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,120
I swear I'll come for you.

121
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,670
No!

122
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,670
What have you done to 
this country and the king, pirate?!

123
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,280
The king burned the city. Didn't you see him?

124
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,950
His Majesty would never do such a thing!

125
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,950
Kyros!

126
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,590
Take this Sea Stone chain off me! I'm not a Devil Fruit user. {I wanna know who in that room could have fastened the chains -Kae}

127
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,560
Kyros, your reputation precedes you.

128
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,860
Join me.

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,370
The king will be replaced, and the old royal family will be destroyed.

130
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,340
My men should already be going after your wife and daughter, who carry the blood of the king.

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,200
Watch closely.

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,920
Dressrosa's time under the Riku family is over.

133
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,090
He cut off his own leg?!

134
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,030
Kyros!

135
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,610
A toy?

136
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,120
That toy just ran off with the king -dasuyan!

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,590
I've been turned into a toy!

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,720
What's going on? Am I dreaming?

139
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,930
King Riku! It's me, Kyros!

140
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm sorry. I've never heard that name before.

141
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,110
I'll forever be in your debt, strange, little toy.

142
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,680
Run, Scarlett, Rebecca!

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,550
Wait for me at the promised place!

144
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,220
Nobody knows my name.

145
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,700
I must get to the red flower field.

146
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,950
Scarlett and Rebecca are waiting for me!

147
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,580
Scarlett? {Yeah seriously, what are the odds that she would just happen to get shot RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM? -Starfish} {stfu already - Sewil}

148
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,220
Scarlett!

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,690
Scarlett!

150
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,700
Somebody's been shot!

151
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,570
The Riku Royal Army again?!

152
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,440
Why? Why didn't you wait for me?!

153
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
Of course.

154
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,920
I must have disappeared from your mind too.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,390
Both our promise...

156
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,260
and our time together...

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,540
Scarlett!

158
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,770
Scarlett, hang in there!

159
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,210
Scarlett! Scarlett!

160
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,250
Scarlett, hang in there!

161
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,790
I don't know who you are...

162
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,690
but my daughter is waiting for me, 
and she's famished...

163
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,730
Please...

164
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,330
It's me! It's Kyros!

165
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,140
Please...

166
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,180
Scarlett...

167
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,410
Scarlett!

168
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,920
Scarlett!

169
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,230
How can this be our parting?

170
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,830
This is hell! It's too cruel!

171
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,000
With these tin arms, 
I can't even feel your fading warmth!

172
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,380
Scarlett!

173
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,990
Soldier-san.

174
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,390
Soldier-san!

175
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,730
Soldier-san!

176
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,130
Oh, Viola-sama.

177
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,800
Are you alright?

178
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,130
We're in trouble. I can see our enemies coming at us from the first floor.

179
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,970
Unacceptable! So it was just someone impersonating the young master? {His own fault for not seeing through the terrible disguise xD}

180
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,100
Straw Hat and the others must be on the second floor or higher!

181
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,450
Violet's blood was on the wall!

182
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,680
This is bad.

183
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,220
If we're about to be cornered into a fight,

184
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,260
maybe it'd be better for me to launch a sneak attack on Doflamingo right now.

185
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,100
Usoland and the others may not make it in time.

186
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,500
You're all pirates, huh.

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,540
I noticed it about Fraland and Usoland after a while.

188
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,870
You got a problem with that?

189
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,780
I used to be an outlaw myself.

190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,250
As long as we share a common goal, I'll happily fight alongside you.

191
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,720
Corrida Colosseum

192
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,200
The ceiling in the Colosseum's basement is cracking!

193
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,060
Even before the finals, 
hundreds of monsters were fighting here.

194
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,800
This day has taken its toll on the building.

195
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Burgess's attacks are the final straw!
The entire place could collapse!

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,970
Surging Elbow!

197
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,900
That bastard!

198
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,510
Don't fire at us!

199
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,480
Good.

200
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,690
I'll tell you as many times as I have to, Rebecca.

201
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,360
It was I who shot and killed your mother, Scarlett.

202
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,830
Hey! My barrier can't block verbal attacks!

203
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,770
Soldier-san, I can't...

204
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,710
Mother, I'm hungry.{Copy-paste from 651}{ I had seen this error posted in the chat, so why was it still here? -Btwb }

205
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,610
I'll go get us something to eat.

206
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,350
Okay.{End copy-paste from 651}

207
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,250
I'm so frustrated, I can't even move! {So wait, she's face-to-face with her mother's killer, who is rubbing that fact right in her face... And she responds by breaking down crying and being paralyzed with... frustration? Damn Rebecca, you SUCK. -Starfish}

208
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,020
Toys' House

209
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,330
Cyborg Franky has been brought down!

210
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,130
U... Usopp... you can do it.

211
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,640
Hurry and create some panic!

212
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,110
Usoland! Usoland!

213
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,610
The Underground Trade Port

214
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,150
There's an intense battle going on at the Commanders' Tower.

215
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,720
Hang in there, Usopp from the Straw Hat Pirates!

216
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,280
I've never even seen you, but hang in there, Usopp!

217
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,320
If you win, I'll be indebted to you forever!

218
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,430
Hang in there!

219
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,690
Hang in there!

220
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,060
I don't want to be a toy for the rest of my life!

221
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,100
If you can turn me back, I won't hunt Straw Hat any more!

222
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,530
I'd gladly become your underling or anything!

223
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,600
Hang in there!

224
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
I'll give you as much money as you like! Just help me!

225
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,380
Trebol, hurry and get Sugar to the palace.

226
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,950
It's fine, Doffy. Nothing is gonna happen.

227
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,620
The enemy isn't even conscious anymore.

228
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,720
Usoland!

229
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,320
You can have this poisoned grape back.

230
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,500
The tatababasco...

231
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,160
That was our only hope!

232
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,100
You eat it...

233
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,900
and die.

234
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,140
Sugar! What are you doing?!

235
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,340
Get a grip!

236
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,280
S-Sugar...

237
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,610
fainted!

238
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,450
Su-

239
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,150
Sugar fainted!

240
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm back to normal! {I don't know if I should be impressed that they actually animated her transformation without cheaping out... or be rolling my eyes at the fact that OF COURSE they had to specifically focus the camera on her butt and boobs at the end. -Starfish}{I went with rolling my eyes -Kae}

241
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,850
The toys are...

242
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,220
It keeps getting bigger!{that's what she said}

243
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,990
I'm back!

244
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,080
Sugar!

245
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,830
Hey! Hey!

246
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,830
This is terrible!

247
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,970
What's that commotion about?

248
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,200
What?

249
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,540
What is going on here?

250
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,610
What?!

251
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,910
It turned into a weird old man!

252
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,020
What's happening to me?!

253
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm back to normal!

254
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,620
Wait! {Thank goodness he got his arm back there... -Starfish}

255
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,270
S-Sugar is... Doffy, I'm so sorry!

256
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,370
Quiet down, Trebol!

257
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,010
What about Sugar?

258
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,880
S-She's...

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,080
been knocked...

260
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,610
unconscious!

261
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,420
Hey...

262
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,050
Are you kidding me?!{I can just feel the unspoken "are you FUCKING kidding me?!" in there. -kae}

263
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,000
All the workers we've gathered over the past ten years...

264
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,930
are reverting to humans!

265
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,500
The Hobby Hobby curse is being lifted!

266
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,120
I remember!

267
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,970
What on earth is going on here?!

268
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,440
Um, I mean...

269
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,820
What could be happening?! The toys...

270
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,510
The toys are turning into humans!

271
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,520
Some of them aren't even human!

272
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,020
Don't tell me Sugar has been...

273
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Our ten years of work...

274
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,030
Sugar has been defeated by somebody -in!

275
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,000
That little brat is pathetic.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,130
But...

277
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,160
I hope she's not hurt.

278
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,040
So hard-boiled!{gag}

279
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,740
Royal palace, please respond!

280
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,110
Everyone's calling in with emergencies!

281
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,750
Urgent report from the southern district, Sebio!

282
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,720
The toys assigned to work at the port have turned into pirates!

283
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
This is the eastern district, Carta!

284
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,730
The toys have become former Dressrosa soldiers!

285
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,660
Government workers!

286
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,240
Marines!

287
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,880
Officials from foreign countries!

288
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,570
Giant beasts!

289
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,670
Reporting from the Primula District!

290
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,610
They're real!

291
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,950
Hang in there, Usopp!

292
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,520
Usoland!

293
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,850
Usoland!

294
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,490
Thanks to you, we were able to become human again.

295
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,120
We did it...

296
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,730
Operation SOP is a success!

297
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,900
Everyone's so happy to be human again.

298
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,240
What's wrong, Onepoco?

299
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,170
Mommy, Onepoco's acting strange.

300
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,250
Onepoco!

301
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,650
One... poco?

302
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,590
No, you're...

303
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm back! {Oh my god, it says "Not Onepoco" on the back of his shirt. That is so stupid it's amazing.}

304
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,760
Dear!

305
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,480
Papa! You're not Onepoco!{I find it jarring that we use Daddy when he's clearly saying Papa... but I guess if we used "Daddy" before, then we're stuck with it. -Fadeout4}{I'm actually not sure why we're using "Daddy" here, either. That's kinda weird. care to explain, oh tl/tlc? -Kae}{Xemnas: Translation wise there's no specific reason to go with "Daddy" over "Papa" and after checking in his past appearance the child didn't use the word "papa" so we don't have a precedence to follow in this instance and thus I also agree with the use of "Papa".}

306
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,160
That's right, I'm your papa!

307
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,460
Papa!{Xemnas: See line 209}

308
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,800
How could we have forgotten you all this time?

309
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,840
It was a curse. I was afraid I'd spend my whole life as a toy!

310
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,350
Daddy, lift me up!

311
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,620
Up you go!

312
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,090
Damn, he's hiding again!

313
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,660
Where'd you go, stone man?!

314
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,830
Everyone!

315
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,970
Um...

316
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,180
I'm... alive...

317
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,380
The hero lives!

318
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,780
Usopp!

319
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,150
Usoland, we can't thank you enough!

320
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,400
It all... went just as planned.

321
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,570
So cool!

322
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,840
Now... my crew will handle the rest.

323
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,140
The battle... has only just begun.

324
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,850
Alright!

325
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,620
Take down Doflamingo!

326
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,420
Doflamingo tricked us all!

327
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,020
What are they talking about? He's a great king.

328
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,040
You don't know what he's really like.

329
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,800
He's the devil himself!

330
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Kill Doflamingo!{Does this guy have rabies? O_O}

331
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,170
Come out, Doflamingo!

332
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,140
We'll teach him how much we've suffered these ten years!

333
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,510
What's going on here, Issho-san?

334
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,210
Seems the tide has turned.

335
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,420
This country was covered by a much deeper darkness than I thought.

336
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,090
Bring down Doflamingo!

337
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,230
Who's that?!

338
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,870
Kyros!

339
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,240
I'd forgotten all about him.

340
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,540
What are you talking about?

341
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,910
Huh? Where's the tin soldier?

342
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,080
That's him.

343
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,880
Huh? But that's a human!

344
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,020
All the toys used to be human. They'd been erased from our memories!

345
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,890
Now that Sugar has been defeated, our memories have returned!

346
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,270
He is the former captain of the Riku Royal Army...

347
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,340
Kyros!

348
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,140
The mightiest warrior in the history of the Colosseum!

349
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,860
Isn't he the guy on that statue?

350
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,410
Yes, that's him. And he's also...

351
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,520
Rebecca's father!

352
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,150
Huh? But she said she'd never met him!

353
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,140
All these years while he'd been forgotten,

354
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,960
he had no way of telling her who he really was!

355
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,060
He's been watching over his beloved daughter for a decade!

356
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,980
He's stayed by her side every single day as a toy soldier!

357
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,420
Who are you?!

358
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,930
It's you!

359
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,330
Kyros?!

360
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,530
Yes!

361
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,740
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for ten years!

362
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,910
I'm here to save you!

363
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,330
I've come to restore the true Dressrosa!{did he really just die as cleanly and unceremoniously as that? if so, I'm just so incredibly pleased. that's awesome. -Kae}

364
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,210
Ten years.

365
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,280
We've had to endure your rule for ten years!

366
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,960
Doflamingo-sama!

367
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,090
Young master!

368
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,160
Damn you!

369
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,160
Mingo died!

370
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,400
But I wanted to send him flying...

371
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,330
I see them!

372
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,540
Over there! Damn you!

373
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,320
We've been spotted.

374
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,500
Fire!

375
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,710
Let's save Traf!

376
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,610
Corrida Colosseum

377
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,450
What's a gorilla doing in the spectators' seats?!

378
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,090
Run!

379
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,490
This is a disaster.

380
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,160
Trebol, you were supposed to keep an eye on Sugar!

381
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,330
You fool.

382
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,660
Hey, you done crying yet?

383
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,370
I ain't your babysitter. {Cecil: Barto is so cool!}

384
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,900
You don't understand...

385
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,600
I...

386
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,310
I have a father!

387
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,780
That seems to have been this country's secret, Rebecca.{"That" presumably being the whole collective amnesia-deal. -Starfish}

388
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,290
Everything has a core. {Cecil: He means heart/centre/secret/weak spot I assume?}

389
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,520
As long as you dig enough.

390
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,790
Now you're spouting confusing nonsense too, grand senpai?

391
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,760
The same goes for this arena.

392
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,370
It has a core.

393
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,770
How about we put an end to this match?

394
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,650
Dragon Claw Technique...

395
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,860
Dragon's Breath!

396
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,440
Amazing! Lucy's attack is unbelievably powerful!

397
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,240
The arena is sinking!

398
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,440
The arena exploded!

399
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,150
I'm losing my footing!

400
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,620
What have you done?!

401
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,190
Something came up. I'm going to win now.

402
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,560
Oh.{Is it just me or is there something... off... about her face in this scene? -Starfish}

403
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,760
I heard a really loud noise from up there.

404
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,790
Hack?

405
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,700
Did he do something crazy again?!

406
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,430
He's on his way to the underground now.
