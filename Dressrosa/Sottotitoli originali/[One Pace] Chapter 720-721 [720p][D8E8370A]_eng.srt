the Blackbeard Pirates' "Champion", Jesus Burgess!

From Block B we have the captain

Only one more finalist remains to be selected!

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,010
However,
due to the massive damage done to the arena,

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,450
we will postpone the start of Block D
for fifteen minutes! { def: yeah, 15 minutes should take care of that }{Xemnas: Magic?}

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,600
Bring out a replacement arena!

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,910
Fix it already!

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,070
What's going on?

61
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,030
He shouted "Straw Hat" again.

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,100
Oh yeah, Straw Hat.

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,970
Wasn't he that pirate who failed
to save his brother at Marineford?{Yeah they say "choujou sensou", which we have always translated as "the great war" here... but over time I have grown to not particularly like that translation at all so I prefer to just say Marineford personally. They both get the point across anyway. -Starfish}

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,150
As if not saving someone is special!  I can do that too, you know.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,200
W-W-Whad're you doin'?!  Cut i' out! {Note that due to being kinda flattened by a barrier he's having some trouble enunciating clearly. Hence the "doin'". If possible, plz add some more indicators of this. -Starfish}{ def: changing t to d represents it well but makes a bit tough to read.  just went with i' instead of it }

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,770
I am a noble from the Kingdom of Biggschots! {Yeah I just copied FUNi's translation of the place here. It's originally "Doereena Oukoku" which translates to something like "Super-Great Kingdom". -Starfish}

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,490
Stop it!

68
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,900
Y-You're crushing me!

69
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,670
Do you have any idea who you were just casually laughing at?!

70
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,510
Now listen up! Straw Hat Luffy-senpai is the man
who will someday stand at the very top of this era!

71
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,250
He is the future Pirate King!

72
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,250
I was there...

73
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,240
on that fateful day, over two years ago!

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,100
In Loguetown... in the East Blue!

75
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,920
On the legendary execution stand,
where the Pirate King Roger himself died!

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Trapped in a hopeless position, that man declared...

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm the man who will be the Pirate King!

78
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,300
And in that moment, the heavens...{Xemnas: Never knew Dragon lived in the heavens. No wonder no one can find him.}

79
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,970
brought down the lightning, and saved him!

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,190
I witnessed a miracle!

81
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,940
Ever since that day, I fanatically read
everything I could about the Straw Hat Pirates.

82
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,790
Alabasta, Enies Lobby, Impel Down...

83
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,730
And last but not least,
the fateful events at Marineford!

84
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,650
That incident sent shivers down my spine!

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,520
Boss! What should we do
with the enemy soldiers we just defeated?

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Just throw'em in the sea.

87
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,750
Back where I lived, I was just a crimelord whose turf covered a measly one hundred and fifty towns.

88
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,070
I looked up to Luffy-senpai.

89
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,510
And finally, I set out to sea myself!

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,460
Just try to say something like that again!

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,320
You put your pathetic existence on a pedestal
and act like you're looking down on Luffy-senpai!

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,000
What can you do?  You pathetic insect!

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,540
Now Bartolomeo's gone crazy too!

94
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,370
Let go already!

95
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,740
Why should I have to fight you in the first place?!

96
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,460
I'm exhausted!

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,140
Hey!  Somebody stop them!

98
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,030
I'm not getting involved!  It's too dangerous!

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,460
Y-Yeah, there's no way I could go up to him!

100
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,410
I'm chickening out and losing my chance!

101
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,290
I'm just too nervous to approach him!

102
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,920
That scar underneath his eye... He's the real deal!

103
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,230
He's so friggin' cool!

104
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,430
Huh?  My eyes are tearing up so much I can't see.

105
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,670
How I wish I could kill that filthy cabbage
and protect my hero!

106
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,870
Hey you! Gedh awah fwom him, cab...

107
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,780
It's no good, I can't!

108
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,030
Hey, Straw Hat!

109
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,940
Listen up!
Gramps has something he wants to say to you.

110
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,060
Hang in there, Grandpa!

111
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,700
Huh? You're still doing this?! Look, I won fair and square!

112
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,780
You've got it wrong!

113
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,280
I don't even hate Garp any more.

114
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,480
I want to convey my immense gratitude!

115
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,870
Please, just let me thank...

116
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,090
Wait, grandson of Garp!

117
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,630
Hold it, Straw Hat!

118
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,250
He ran straight past me!

119
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,380
Um, wait!

120
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,470
Hey, don't run away from a fight!

121
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,710
W-W-W-What do I do?

122
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,430
I wanna talk to him, but I just don't know how!

123
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,140
Please, wait!

124
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,660
I wanted to show my gratitude
for putting my head back to normal... {kind of guessing on what's thoughts and what's not here -Fadey}

125
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,650
by offering to make
my grandchildren's Happou Navy serve you.

126
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Wait!

127
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,090
What is with all these guys?  They're so persistent!

128
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,740
Wait!

129
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,030
Hold it!

130
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,030
Please, wait!

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,310
Really... I just want to relax for a bit.

132
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,740
This way, Lucy.

133
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,440
Oh, it's you! Um...

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,240
It's Rebecca.  You sure have a lot of enemies.

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,010
Follow me.

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,910
Right, thanks!

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,150
Well, you could say the same about Shiliew.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,830
But I don't trust Aokiji.

139
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh, hold on, Captain.

140
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,380
Straw Hat's here.

141
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,710
Oh, you're there too?

142
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,510
Straw Hat?

143
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,370
Blackbeard?!

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,010
Long time no see, Straw Hat! {can some of this... be cut?} {no}

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,630
I sure was surprised when I heard that you were Commander Ace's little brother!

146
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,960
Shouldn't you be there?

147
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,920
They're gonna start soon, ya know?

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,180
Your brother's execution, that is!

149
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,380
Blackbeard?

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,580
That's right.  It's been a while, hasn't it? { def: if he says the same thing as the flashback then we should keep the line the same }

151
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,540
So I understand you're participating in the tournament, "Lucy"?

152
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,190
But my man, Burgess,
is going to win the Flame Fruit!

153
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,540
It's almost like Ace is joining my crew.
It's going to be great!

154
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,680
I mean, he did refuse the offer last time! {Halee: How about replacing it with "I mean, he did refuse the offer last time!"}

155
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,420
You're the last person I'd let have Ace's power!

156
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,900
I look forward to fighting you!

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,480
You know that pirate?

158
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,740
Yeah.

159
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,340
I can't let him win the tournament!

160
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,650
Don't you have any more free samples, lady?

161
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,810
You're just going to eat samples
without buying anything, aren't you!

162
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,490
Hang on!

163
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm so sorry, Miss.

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
What do you want, Lucy?

165
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,920
You're gonna buy me food?!

166
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,080
Oh, he's a friend of yours, Rebecca?

167
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,270
Thank you very much.

168
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,750
Sorry, I couldn't afford much.

169
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,670
Don't worry. Thanks for treating me, Rebecca.

170
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,410
So, where are we?

171
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,380
This is the dormitory for the colosseum gladiators.

172
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,020
Though some people would call it a prison.

173
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,570
Guest competitors never come down here, so you can relax here until the finals.

174
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,780
Really?  That's great!

175
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,810
Gladiator Exclusive to the Corrida Colosseum
Rebecca

176
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,220
That was some fight.

177
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,810
You're a lot stronger than I expected.

178
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,390
Is it good?

179
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,420
Yup. The colosseum-lunch is delicious!

180
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,080
You're not hungry?

181
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,320
Mother, I'm hungry.{Xemnas: I don't think a child would use the word famished.}

182
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,440
No, I... I don't get hungry.

183
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,620
Really? You're like a samurai.

184
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,120
Got you! Rebecca, this is your chance to kill him!

185
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,050
What?!

186
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,090
Isn't that why you brought him down here?!

187
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,720
Hey, what's going on here, Rebecca?!

188
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,510
Hurry up!

189
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,880
H-Hey! You'll spill the food!

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,860
Kill him!

191
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,120
What's wrong?

192
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,570
You have to kill him,
or you'll never accomplish your goal!

193
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,450
Goal?

194
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,070
Rebecca was pinned!

195
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,080
I can't believe he moves faster than she does!

196
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,240
Do whatever you want.

197
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,060
I deserve it.

198
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,230
I wouldn't do anything
to the person who bought me lunch.

199
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,500
I tried to kill you!

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,750
It doesn't matter.  I'm not dead. {Xemnas: Nuance and all.}

201
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,600
Besides, you weren't really trying to kill me. { def: you weren't really trying to kill me }{Xemnas: Definitely prefer your suggestion.}

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
Ow... { def: This hurts. }

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,420
How could he forgive you so easily?

204
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,610
That really shows the difference in power
between you two, Rebecca.

205
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,490
If we'd been able to take out one of the big shots here,
at least we would've had a little hope.{Halee: I think "If we'd been able to take out one of the big shots here, at least we would've had a little hope." sounds better.}

206
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,220
A mummy?!

207
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,170
We're not mummies!

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,040
We're the prisoner gladiators.

209
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,630
Rebecca is one of us too.

210
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,350
We have to keep fighting in the arena
until we're killed for the amusement of the audience.

211
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,750
All because we showed some slight resistance toward the Doflamingo Family. { def: we didn't support the Doflamingo Family with enough enthusiasm }

212
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,130
The king says we can earn our freedom by winning a thousand matches...

213
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,800
but even the most talented fighter would lose if
he was forced to fight to the death a thousand times.

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,020
And anyone who tries to escape is shot to death.

215
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,540
There's no way out for us.

216
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:56,220
Ten years ago, before Doflamingo became king,
colosseum battles weren't fought to the death.

217
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,410
But under his rule, the country has become sharply divided between light and shadow.{Xemnas: Spelling fix}

218
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,350
I...

219
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,930
will win the tournament today, whatever it takes... {Quality... POWER UUUUPP}

220
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,890
and use the Flame Fruit's power
to kill Doflamingo!

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,140
Today, Soldier-san's army
is going to challenge Doflamingo... {Her waist is smaller than Nami's here... seriously, she looks like a concentration camp victim O_O}{Xemnas: Well considering she's a prisoner, and I doubt she gets much money if any at all, I don't think she's fed properly.}

222
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,960
in order to free us.

223
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,030
He intends to sacrifice his own life...

224
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,140
to bring down this kingdom!

225
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,360
It's alright!

226
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,900
Soldier-san is brave...

227
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,500
and he will always watch over you!

228
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,070
I will do it before he can!

229
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,840
I'm tired of always being protected!

230
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,100
This time, I'm going to protect him!

231
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,730
Soldier-san's gonna die.

232
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,500
Soldier?

233
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,080
The toy soldier with one leg.

234
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,970
A toy?

235
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,540
Oh, pardon me old man.

236
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,940
I met a guy like that at the entrance to the colosseum.{The following line doesn't really make sense if he outright says "Oh yeah, I met THAT SPECIFIC GUY". The Japanese line literally just means "someone like that" anyway. -Starfish}

237
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,180
Yeah, that's probably him.

238
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,660
We can't leave this colosseum.

239
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,120
Even if something's going on outside, there's nothing we can do.

240
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,420
So you're worried about a toy dying?

241
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,210
I think it's stranger that a toy's alive to begin with.

242
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,470
Since you're an outsider,
you probably wouldn't understand.

243
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,570
They're no different from humans like us.

244
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,440
They befriend people who are lonely.

245
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,080
Look after people with no siblings.

246
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,490
And become lovers for the loveless.

247
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,360
We're so close, I don't understand why we can't live together.

248
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:34,160
Ever since I lost my mother, the last family I had,
Soldier-san's has been there to raise me.

249
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,710
He's like a father to me.

250
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,990
Hmm, so that toy... {Let's get a famous Sewil "flash" of the Soldier here}

251
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

252
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,940
The broken ring has been replaced!{He specifically says that they've REPLACED it, not repaired the one that was already there. -Starfish}

253
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,030
Your match is about to start, Rebecca.

254
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,180
Hey, what are you doing, Lucy?!

255
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,790
During that scuffle earlier, some food fell on the floor.

256
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,470
Sorry. You spent all the money you had on these,
so I don't want it to go to waste.{This could perhaps stand some trimming down... I just thought the previous translation was a bit confusing so I thought I'd clarify it a bit. -Starfish}

257
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,570
They're still good though, even though they've been on the ground!{Yeah... I still wouldn't eat that personally though. Ah well, you're the one who's gonna have a terrible stomachache later. -Starfish}

258
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,560
You don't look like a prisoner to me.

259
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,610
Let's meet in the finals.

260
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,960
The match is about to start!

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,380
Block D participants, to the ring!

262
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,110
Mother!{It was "Mother" and not "Mommy" last episode... Plus as Xemnas points out in the following line, Rebecca does speak in a very formal tone. -Starfish}

263
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,300
Mother, look at all the flowers I picked. {Xemnas: Both Rebecca and Scarlett speak quite formally}

264
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,920
Oh, Rebecca!

265
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,840
Would you like one?

266
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,450
Thank you, I think I'll take one.

267
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,760
This is from mother to you.

268
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,950
Now, let us go.

269
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,030
Yeah.

270
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,300
The Riku Royal Army has set the village on fire!

271
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,960
Please stop!

272
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,650
What has gotten into the king?!

273
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,930
The royal palace... it's burning.

274
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,600
What's happening to this country?

275
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,900
Please keep running, Scarlett-sama!

276
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,810
Who's this midget!? Out of the way!

277
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,080
Keep running!  Get as far as you can!

278
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,120
Mother, I'm hungry.

279
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,480
I know. We haven't had anything to eat for two days.{ def: this line may be from a previous episode }{Indeed it is. The previous and next lines too. They were from 650. So I have replaced them with the lines from 650[timed][editad][TLCed][qced].ass. -Starfish}

280
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,680
Rebecca,
can you manage on your own for a little while?

281
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,500
Promise you won't leave this place.

282
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,490
I'll go get us something to eat.

283
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,230
Okay!

284
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,740
Mother?

285
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,380
I-I couldn't protect her.

286
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,980
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect your mother.

287
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,660
She wanted me to give you this.

288
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,560
She said...
that you were waiting with an empty stomach.

289
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,580
Mother, I'm hungry. {Copy paste from this ep.}

290
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,440
I'll go get us something to eat. {end copy past from this ep}

291
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,860
There were blood stains on the staircase.

292
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,900
They must be around here somewhere.

293
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,760
Find them!

294
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

295
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,210
Your mother was a very important person.{Isis: is it important or noble?}

296
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,780
Did you know that a new king has taken the throne in this land?

297
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,460
He's trying to catch all the important people from before.

298
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,700
Since you're the daughter of your important mother,
they're trying to catch you as well.

299
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,270
I couldn't protect your mother, but I'll protect you with my life.

300
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:21,180
Until the day you can find true happiness, I'll always be by your side.

301
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,090
I want my mother.

302
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,600
You couldn't protect my mother. I hate you!{Unless there is a very good reason for using third person in reference to the specific character being addressed... We probably should stay away from using third person in reference to the specific character being addressed. -Starfish}

303
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,650
How about this?  How about this?

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,430
How about this?

305
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,110
Where are you going, Rebecca?!

306
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,520
I'm going home!

307
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,470
You can't.

308
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,040
The new king has agents waiting for you
in town and at your house.

309
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,260
Doflamingo-sama!

310
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,380
Doflamingo, Doflamingo!

311
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,790
For hundreds of years, the Riku royal family has brought suffering upon this poor country!{ manga: For hundreds of years, the Riku Royal Family have brought nothing but suffering to this poor kingdom! } {Halee: In theory we could remove the comma, unless the "For hundreds of years" is to be emphasized.}

312
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,680
And finally, they've tried to steal what little money their subjects had, just to satisfy their own greed! { manga: In the end, they even had the gall to steal from their own subjects out of greed! }

313
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm going to bring wealth to this country!

314
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,140
So toys can work too?

315
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,850
I need the money.

316
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,040
Rebecca!

317
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,680
Boo!

318
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,870
You idiot!

319
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,040
Look at how sturdy I am.

320
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,560
I'm a sturdy and strong super toy!

321
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,750
Soldier-san is brave...

322
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,600
and he will always watch over you.{Exact same phrasing as in the last episode (though he wasn't singing it there... despite the manga clearly indicating that he was supposed to be), so I copy-pasted the translation from there. -Starfish}

323
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,090
It must be cold.

324
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,370
Though I can't feel anything with this tin body of mine. { def: brick?  any chance of tin? }{Tin indeed. -Starfish}

325
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
Does it feel warm?

326
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,680
Yes, it feels very warm.

327
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,380
Soldier-san is valiant...

328
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,520
and he will always watch over you.

329
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,920
How much is the rent for this house?

330
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,620
It's abandoned, so you can just use it.

331
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,570
This area was ransacked by the Riku Royal Army.

332
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,510
So most of the residents have left.

333
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,850
This house is warm.

334
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,080
You should close the window.

335
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,610
No.

336
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,030
There are toys here as well.

337
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,880
Children as well. Go and play with them.

338
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,220
Since people are watching us in this village,
I'll have to abide by the laws for toys.

339
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,100
So I'll have to go to the Toys' House when you go to sleep, but I'll definitely be back before you wake up.

340
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,470
As proof that I'm always by your side,

341
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll drop a single flower petal
through the gap in the window every morning.

342
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,880
Good morning, Soldier-san.

343
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,460
Ah, good morning.

344
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,830
She must be an orphan.

345
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,980
So the family won't be a problem.

346
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,900
Rebecca!

347
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,440
She's pretty cute,
so we'll probably get a good price for her.

348
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,010
Rebecca!

349
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,420
Damn you, how dare a toy go against humans!

350
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,740
I'll break you! { def: ...in half! }

351
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,030
Soldier-san!

352
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,390
Rebecca!

353
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,000
Forgive me. I've become a wanted man.

354
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,180
Then we're the same.

355
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,770
Let's look for another house.

356
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,590
I want to live in the same house as you, one day.

357
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,830
I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

358
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,440
That's okay, I've got you to protect me.

359
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
And what do you plan to do
if something happens to me?

360
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,570
Mother said that it's bad to hurt people.

361
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm teaching you this so that you don't get hurt.

362
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,980
Now come at me.

363
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
You were always by my side.

364
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
You protected me time and time again.

365
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,510
Here she comes!

366
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,080
Are you ready, everyone?!

367
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,000
Our colosseum's very own beautiful female gladiator.

368
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,470
The phantom princess!

369
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,760
No one gets the audience worked up like she does.

370
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,190
Please don't die, Soldier-san.

371
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,320
I...

372
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,980
Screw you, Rebecca!

373
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,850
Today's the day you die!

374
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,900
The entire Riku family can burn in hell!

375
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,070
Your family is scum!

376
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,460
won't lose!

377
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,560
Why does everyone hate her?

378
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,220
She's a good person!

379
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,380
Screw them, she bought me lunch-

380
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
We know!

381
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,750
But Rebecca's grandfather
is hated by the entire country.{Isis: haterd or grudge sound stronger to me}

382
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,900
He's the previous King.
