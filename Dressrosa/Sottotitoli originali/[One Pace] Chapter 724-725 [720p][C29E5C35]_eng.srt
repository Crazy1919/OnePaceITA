I can't move!

What? Sanji-san's frozen mid-air!

58
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,650
He cannot move.
 The young master's power has stopped him. {split?}

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,300
Black Leg is like a fly trapped in a spider's web.

What is that?!

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,860
A whip?!

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,160
Stay out of this! Run!

64
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,030

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,220

It's Traf! He saved Sanji!

75
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,580
Sorry, this is my fault.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,670
I'll take us to the ship.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,400
Traf-san?

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,320
Sanji!

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,950
Dammit, I'm back on this ship!

80
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,760
Caesar!

81
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,610
Oh, Jora! Help me!

82
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,450
I am a prisoner as well.

83
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,050
I got careless.

84
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,660
Doflamingo's attacking again!

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,760
Black Legger.

86
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,660
How are you guys doing with the destruction of the factory?{Xemnas: Nuance and all.}

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,840
Franky said he knows where it is, but that destroying it will be difficult.

88
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,690
Where is Father?! And Kanjurou?!

89
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,070
San-goro!

90
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,840
The samurai's inside the factory too.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,980
We will be able to save him.

92
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,920
We still need more time, huh?

93
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey you! Is that my heart?!

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
Were you keeping it in the cabin?!

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,010
This one is mine. I had your heart.

96
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,210
What?!

97
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,850
Damn it!

98
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,150
S-So you were storing it inside your own chest?!

99
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,850
You guys.

100
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,050
You have to go to Zou with this guy, right now.

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,600
Zou?

102
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,520
Didn't I give you a Vivre Card pointing toward the next island?

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,030
We're moving on? But what about Luffy-san and the others?!

104
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,560
Once the factory is destroyed, we're done here.

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,550
We'll catch up with you soon enough.

106
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,330
No, we have to wait!

107
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,250
We can't set sail without our captain!

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,680
We are the Straw Hat Pirates!

109
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,350
A warship's flying straight toward us!{Wow. That is the slowest-falling ship I have seen in a long time. -Starfish}{ I assume Fujitora is slowing it with gravity.}

110
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,790
Why?!

111
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,140
Fujitora, huh? {DUUUUUHHHHHHUHEUIDHKGHDAJKSG}

112
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,960
And Doflamingo's coming from the other direction!

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,260
You can stay if you want to, but don't let them have Caesar.

114
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,740
Fire!

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,310
Something's falling from the sky!

116
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
Meteors?!

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,600
Room!

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,240
Traf-kun! The "Swirly Hat Pirates" are setting sail!{lol}

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,060
Get going!

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,830
Hey, Law!

121
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,800
I understand that we have to get Caesar away from here...

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,770
and I'm fine with moving forward...

123
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,900
but...

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,720
Dressrosa was supposed to be a brief stop.

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,970
Our ultimate goal was to take down the Emperor Kaidou, right?

126
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,500
Don't you think... you're focusing too much on Doflamingo?

127
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,950
Meteors! Meteors!

128
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,640
Tact!

129
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,290
Isshou-san, there's a hole in the hull!

130
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,190
Oh, what a blunder. So Law-san was down there.

131
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,270
Is this really the time to be eating?!

132
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,700
Let's just go back to Dressrosa.

133
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,550
The tide of war...

134
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,270
will shift soon, it seems.

135
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,240
Give the order to turn around!

136
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,620
You're not getting away!

137
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,760
It's that whip again!

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,430
Joker, help me!

139
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,870
Overheat!

140
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,830
Namier! Listen up.

141
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,840
You have to find a path without clouds!

142
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,990
Doflamingo ate the String Fruit.

143
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,040
He can attach threads to clouds and move through the air.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,850
He can't follow you if the sky is clear!

145
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,500
Threads? I see.

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,910
Just go already!

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,740
Here goes! Coup de Burst!

148
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,020
Look, Doflamingo!

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,730
Law, what are you doing?!

150
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,780
Young master, don't worry about me!

151
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,870
What are you hoping to achieve by letting half of the Straw Hats escape?

152
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,790
The rest of them are still on Dressrosa.

153
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,330
I just have to take them all hostage, and I'll have Caesar back in no time.

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,520
Didn't you say that underestimating them was a fatal mistake? {Argh, I *KNOW* Doffy said something along these lines not too long ago, but I can't for the life of me find the exact line in which he said it! -Starfish}

155
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,440
It's a shame, but my alliance with the Straw Hats ends here.

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,170
I teamed up with them for one goal.

157
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,640
I was merely using them to stop the Smile production.{Note that in the manga, emphasis is put on "using them". So editors, whatever you do, do not remove that bit or I will punch you. -Starfish}

158
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,430
Even if I can't take you down personally,

159
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,960
if you lose the Smiles,

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,000
you'll soon be killed by Kaidou.

161
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,720
I see.

162
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,230
So you hoped to take me down with you.

163
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,760
I'd like to see the chaos your death will bring to the world,

164
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,700
but my main priority is settling the score for what happened thirteen years ago,{Halee: Ellipsis, instead of a comma? There's a pause at the end.}

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Joker!

166
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,350
What are you planning to do to Jora?

167
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,520
You should know what kind of family we are.

168
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,020
That's right, Law! {Changed punctuation and added exclamation -Swashy-B}

169
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,190
If it's for the young master then I'm always ready to sacrifice my-

170
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,130
You should run as far as possible.

171
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,920
Yes!

172
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,770
Seeing as Black Leg just showed up before, {Removed the period as this sentence is part of the next line. -Swashy-B}

173
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,710
clearly things haven't gone as I planned.

174
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,140
Your grudge against me is completely unjustified, Law!

175
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,020
This isn't a grudge.

176
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,030
Accomplishing that person's greatest desire,{Isis: person's more mysterious and unbiased, since at this point no one knows the identity of this" guy" except for manga readers. Also he clearly said "Hito" which means a human or a person. backseat TLCer :P }{Well, "that person" sounds awkward as hell though. That said, I haven't the faintest idea who this individual Law is talking about even is, so I ain't touching that. (I read the manga, but only through the graphic novels, because shitty fan-translations ew. Therefore, I am not completely caught up and have not yet learned the identity of Law's friend here.) -Starfish}

177
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,710
is the only reason I've lived for until today!

178
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,140
Off Dressrosa's Coast

179
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,410
Is Traf gonna be okay? {Made the first letter lowercase. -Swashy-B}

180
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,410
Hey, are you guys keeping a proper lookout?

181
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,730
This is Brook, I see no problems from my 45° angle.

182
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,940
If he comes anywhere near us,

183
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,790
I'll just use this to create a gust of wind and blow away the clouds.

184
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,320
Then he won't be able to follow us anymore.

185
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,700
In any case, you guys have to protect Robin-chan with your lives!

186
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,430
Got it!

187
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,100
How are they?

188
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,040
My precious Robin-chan is with Franky and Usopp.

189
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,390
Now we just have to hope that Zoro can meet up with Luffy.

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,520
Yeah, Law's plan is to leave Doflamingo alive and have him fight the Emperor Kaidou.

191
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,170
So long as he runs away, he won't die.

192
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,040
What's wrong, Momo?

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,560
Why are you in your dragon form?

194
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,290
I-I can't stop shaking.

195
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,400
That flying man...

196
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,170
When we were here before, I saw him once.

197
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,050
Young master, he'll die!

198
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,520
Just what the hell was that?!

199
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,660
What are you?! {Added '?' -Swashy-B}

200
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,630
Aren't you a gladiator?!

201
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,480
Who'd enjoy watching you just run around?

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,540
If you can't cut up your opponents,

203
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,110
then let yourself get cut and show them some blood.

204
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,820
All humans, no matter their personality,

205
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,280
have a cruel side that lusts for blood.

206
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,730
Blood and death.

207
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,690
That is the ultimate entertainment!

208
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,320
Get a hold of yourself!{Isis: I changed it to this since it's what Momonosuke's remembered back at ep 611}

209
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,520
Damn trash...

210
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,130
Never let me see a pathetic match like today again.

211
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,400
Y-Yes, young master!

212
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,120
Kin'emon, Momonosuke...

213
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,900
Oh, it's you, Kanjurou.

214
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,340
I found the port.

215
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,500
Let's get a ship from there.

216
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,310
This is a dangerous country.

217
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,470
When I think of Kanjurou as his prisoner, I get this uneasy feeling.

218
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,410
Please be safe, Kanjurou...

219
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,100
What sort of ridiculous expression is that?! {Added '?' -Swashy-B}

220
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,600
This all depends on what he wants you for, but...

221
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,960
they might not treat their hostages all that badly.

222
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,170
So it's okay.

223
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,460
You don't care at all!

224
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,370
You're thinking of something else, aren't you?! {Added '?' -Swashy-B}

225
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,250
Speaking of that, Violet-chan said she'd be fine too.

226
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,330
I'll be fine.

227
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,010
I asked an acquaintance of mine, so I'll be protected by the government.

228
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,220
They should already be waiting for me at the port.

229
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,080
I see.

230
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,360
I wish I could go with you, but at least I know you'll be safe.

231
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,750
Thank you.

232
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Thanks to you, I'm finally able to move forward again.

233
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,860
It was nothing.

234
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,910
If you want to thank me, then a kiss on my che-

235
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,300
Oh no, your ship is being attacked by Fighting Fish!{Added capitalization. Because a script-search indicates that Fighting Fish has always been capitalized. -Starfish}

236
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,250
Fighting Fish?

237
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,230
What's that?!

238
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,330
Hurry, you must go to them.

239
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,080
Nami-swan!

240
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,230
Kill her!

241
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,670
Damn that Rebecca!

242
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,460
As usual, she just won't die!

243
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,320
Hurry up and die, you little brat!

244
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,090
Horse-san!

245
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,930
Yes?

246
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,900
Please take me to the palace.

247
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,330
Yes ma'am! {Spelling correction. -Swashy-B}

248
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,970
Dressrosa
Corrida Colosseum

249
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,990
Why are you crying?

250
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,040
Why do you know who Luffy and I are?

251
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,440
I'be albayz bween your ban! {Xemnas: I couldn't make this out and even the script wasn't much help, so I stole this line from CR}

252
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,440
{\an8}I've always been your fan!

253
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,980
We're not getting anywhere with this guy.

254
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,680
C-C-Could I have your auto-

255
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,020
C-Can I have your autograph!?

256
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,170
There, I said it.

257
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,890
Autograph?

258
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,590
I'll go look for Luffy-senpai, so please give me your autograph!

259
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,070
You'll look for him?

260
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,130
Thanks.

261
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,430
Hurry up!

262
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,350
Th-

263
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,470
Th?

264
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,560
Then...

265
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,930
Just wait for a bit.

266
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,270
Even if it costs me my life, I'll find him!

267
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,690
You're gonna risk your life?

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,440
You damn...

269
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,470
Damn it!

270
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,070
She just won't go down!

271
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,900
This is Rebecca's specialty, the Backwater Sword Dance!

272
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,200
Become strong, Rebecca!

273
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,580
Using her opponents momentum, she brings them close to the edge of the ring.

274
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,500
With her back to the Fighting-Fish infested water,

275
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,820
and her amazing speed, she uses her opponent's strength to push them in the water!

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,130
This is it!

277
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,800
This is the Backwater Sword Dance!

278
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,950
Yes, in all her previous matches,
she has never directly harmed a single person!{"Attacked" is the wrong word to use here. Sure, her attacks merely consist of pushing people into water, but she's still ATTACKING. -Starfish}

279
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,320
Prisoner Gladiator Lodging

280
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,470
{\an8}So she can use Observation Haki?

281
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,320
{\an8}Haki?

282
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,290
She's never taken an attack from anyone either!{Isis: she's receiving a lot of attacks, maybe it was meant a " hit" :)}

283
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,170
She's dropped every opponent out of the ring!

284
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,910
She's the undefeated woman!

285
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,230
She's really good!

286
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,150
Keep it up, Rebecca! {Punctuation correction. -Swashy-B}

287
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,530
Her fighting style is not unbeautiful,

288
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,840
and to be honest, I don't dislike it! {Xemnas: He's struggling with himself cause he likes her fighting style but hates her, so I used double negatives to show this. Did steal the double negative idea off CR though.}{Cecil: It fits really well :D}{I'm just annoyed that they left out the "translation" the manga did, where the lines were written out as like "Her fighting style is not unbeautiful! (It's beautiful.) I don't dislike it! (I like it.)" I totally expected them to add subtitles for that just to maintain the joke. Preferrably with a little "DING"-sound. Because I find it funny when some random silly caption appears with a little "DING"-sound. But they did not. Truly this is the worst anime ever. -Starfish}

289
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
But how will she go with this competition!?

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,320
With powerhouses gathered from all over the world and their varied fighting styles, {Fragment. Removed the '!' and added the ',' -Swashy-B}

291
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,910
there's no guarantee that they'll play fair!

292
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,930
Southern Majiatsuka Kingdom
Military Commander
Rolling Logan

293
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,750
Let's see, should I break your bones, hated one?

294
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,420
{\an8}Next!
Is Contestant Sai from the Flower Country here?

295
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,420
Inside the Colosseum
Underground Medical Treatment Facility Waiting Room

296
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,190
Why are you calling "Next"?!

297
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,380
You just carried our Grandpa in there,
and he hasn't come out yet!

298
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,300
Oh, you mean Contestant Chinjao?

299
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,940
Did Grandpa die?

300
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,230
Huh? What's going on?

301
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,540
Shut it, you damn martial artist!

302
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,140
Our Grandpa is practically indestructible, but he's getting pretty old.

303
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,580
If he's lying dead in there,
then just tell me that he's dead!

304
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,280
He's so noisy.

305
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,150
You're being too dramatic.

306
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,460
He has already left the treatment area.

307
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,960
There is an exit at the back of the hospital room...

308
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,010
so after he was treated,
he wouldn't come back this way.

309
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,730
Oh, I see. Sorry for the disturbance.

310
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,030
Now you understand? Well then, come on in.

311
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,840
I'm so sorry I misunderstood. I was wrong.

312
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,410
How can I ever make up for this?

313
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,170
See, I'm on my knees! Please forgive me!

314
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,710
Don't mind him.
His feelings tend to get the better of him.

315
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,600
I... I see.

316
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,860
Contestant Sai from the Flower Country, yes?

317
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,720
That's right.

318
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,320
Let us begin the operation.

319
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,880
What?!

320
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,510
Next.

321
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,780
What's this? A toy?

322
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,610
A mountain of toys?

323
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,010
Toys and warriors.

324
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,110
Who's there?!

325
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,770
You're... Hajrudin?!

326
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,220
Why're... all of you here?

327
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,500
Gramps! You're alright!

328
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,430
That's a relief.

329
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,610
I see nothing to be relieved about, you clown!

330
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,090
It seems like all the losers of this tournament
are thrown down here.

331
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,410
What?!

332
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,980
What is the meaning of this?! Where's the exit?

333
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,650
You really think there'd be one?!

334
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,480
That bastard Doflamingo tricked us.

335
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,320
This means war, Elizabello-sama.

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,550
Indeed. But I can't believe that
my King Punch is ineffective against this wall.

337
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,970
We're underground, you know.

338
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,880
In other words, these walls are the earth itself.

339
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,710
No matter how strong your punches might be,
you can't break through these walls.

340
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,540
What is he hoping to accomplish by trapping us here?
