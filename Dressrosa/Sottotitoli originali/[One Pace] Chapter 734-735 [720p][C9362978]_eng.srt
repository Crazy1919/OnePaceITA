Keep pushing forward!

The bond that joins us will never break

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,460
What a shocking conclusion!

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,620
There were roughly twenty competitors still fighting,

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,880
but they've all been knocked out mysteriously!

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,620
This has never happened in all of the Corrida Colosseum's history!

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,130
But in the center of the ring,

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,600
I can see the shadow of someone getting up!

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,970
Is this the winner?!

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,600
Is this the fighter who did this?!

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,430
Wha-

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,460
R-Rebecca?!

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,040
Rebecca is back on her feet!

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,300
All the renowned fighters in Block D, the people we expected to win...

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,710
are still out cold!

42
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,310
The fourth finalist in the Corrida Colosseum's battle tournament is...

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,630
the descendant of Dressrosa's shameful King Riku, the prisoner gladiator...

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,620
Rebecca!

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,100
Get real!

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,680
What kind of trick did you pull, Rebecca?!

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,230
Investigate her!

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,800
Prisoner Gladiator Lodging

49
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,800
Well done, Rebecca!

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,230
What happened?

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,890
Who cares how she did it?

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,270
The point is, Rebecca's won!

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,150
What the hell is this?! What did that wench do to Cavendish-sama?!

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,690
There's no way Admiral Orlumbus could lose to that little girl!

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,170
Slicing Wind?

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,700
The Slicing Wind of Rommel.

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,930
You wouldn't know...

58
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,550
about the mysterious tragedy that once befell the kingdom of Rommel.

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,200
They say the wind started slashing up people once the night fell.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,740
The Navy was dispatched immediately, but...

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,930
quite a few marines were felled by that wind, as well.

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,540
In the end, the only thing they learned...

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,450
was that the wind was actually a man calling himself Hakuba.

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,410
We still haven't managed to capture him.

65
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,790
Even after leaving the Rommel Kingdom, Hakuba has continued causing trouble in other places.

66
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,540
Wherever Hakuba appears, a 
certain pirate is always there.

67
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,260
What?

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,730
Do you think you can escape me, girl?!

69
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,710
Get out of my way!

70
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,230
There's something strange about him.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,270
He fell asleep?! {Xemnas: Post QC change, changed this to better fit what was being shown as he was awake moments before.}

72
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
S-Sleepwalking?

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
That's right.

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,210
Hakuba is in fact an alternate personality that only appears when Cavendish is sleeping.

75
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,220
Because of the crimes Hakuba has committed,

76
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,420
Cavendish was driven out to sea and became a pirate.

77
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,740
He's rather unfortunate, then.

78
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,650
He's not worth pitying!

79
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,000
Cavendish enjoys his situation.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,610
Stop to pity him, and he'll just attack you while your guard's down.

81
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,880
He already was an expert swordsman,

82
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,720
but Hakuba is twice as strong.

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,660
Still, the fact that he falls asleep whenever his other personality emerges...

84
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,630
has made him ill-suited for this battle royale.

85
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,730
There's no way Rebecca could win!

86
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,150
She must have used a pistol or something!

87
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,660
She won without cutting down a single opponent.

88
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,690
It's a respectable fighting style.

89
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,040
Besides, she was the only one who saw Hakuba's sword coming.

90
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,980
You can't just chalk that up to dumb luck.

91
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,130
Regardless of her circumstances,

92
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,670
I will not let her have the Flame Fruit.

93
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,340
They've really kept me waiting! Now I finally get to fight!

94
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,460
Dressrosa Royal Palace

95
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,360
Did you see that?

96
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,200
Your granddaughter sure is lucky.

97
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,920
Still, I can't believe both you and your granddaughter competed,

98
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,370
King Riku.

99
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,880
For a former king to seek a Devil Fruit, you must really feel driven into a corner.

100
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,860
Rebecca...

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,460
And I must say, your family sure is causing me no end of trouble today.

102
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,800
Even Violet betrayed me.

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,130
Is there some sort of anniversary today?

104
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,740
It seems you don't realize...

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,190
what your actions this morning meant to us.

106
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,310
Regarding the worldwide announcement of Doflamingo
 renouncing his throne and title as a Warlord...{Copy-paste from 642}

107
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,650
It was a mistake.

108
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,080
The information was incorrect.{End copy-paste from 642}

109
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,120
I simply had to fight back.

110
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,520
That's all.

111
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,560
I see. So that's why you took action.

112
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,700
But that doesn't explain Viola.

113
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,450
Unlike you, she is cunning.

114
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,340
She would never let her emotions get the better of her.

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,950
She must have made a wager.

116
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,180
The promising newcomer who dared to defy me...

117
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,220
The Warlord, Trafalgar Law.

118
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,400
And the man from that powerful bloodline, who caused such a stir two years ago...

119
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,980
Monkey D. Luffy.

120
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,140
That woman hopes their pirate alliance will be enough to bring me down.

121
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,140
But Law is already out of commission,

122
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,320
and when Straw Hat Luffy leaves the Colosseum, he will no longer be human.

123
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,020
As for the other Straw Hats...

124
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,660
I hear that Cyborg Franky is attacking the Toys' House on his own.

125
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,670
It remains to be seen if he can beat my commanders.

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,120
The other pieces in play would be...

127
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,640
Pirate Hunter Zoro, Foxfire Kin'emon, Nico Robin and Sogeking.

128
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,930
But they won't even make it to the underground.

129
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,190
I don't know left from right down here, so let's start from the right, please.

130
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,670
At the Foot of the Royal Grounds

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
The lift is up ahead.

132
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,310
Luffy

133
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,310
in Carp

134
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,940
Zoro

135
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,940
in Cat

136
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,460
Kin'emon

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,460
in Frog

138
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,820
Listen up, all of you.

139
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,330
The royal palace, where Doflamingo is,

140
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,520
the Toys' House,

141
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,760
and the trade port where the Smile factory is, are all connected.

142
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,160
So if we go into the royal palace, we can also reach the Toys' House and the factory?

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,530
Exactly!

144
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,690
If you want to go to the factory, you'd normally have to go through either the palace or the Toys' House,

145
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,180
but my allies should have gotten in via a secret passage they've been digging.

146
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,400
We should head for the royal palace first.

147
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,020
Very well, I understand.

148
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,970
But I must say, even seeing one right in front of me,

149
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,170
I can hardly believe that such small people could exist.

150
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,220
Yeah, she's like a toy! It's so cool!

151
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,800
Normally, we're not supposed to show ourselves to any big humans outside the royal family.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,440
You Straw Hat Pirates, aka Usolanders, are the only exception!

153
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,170
Usolanders?

154
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,210
Operation SOP is already in motion.

155
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,170
Look, there it is!

156
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,110
The lift that leads up to the royal palace entrance.

157
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,770
You'll have to show the guards a pass if you want to ride the lift...

158
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,880
No problem. I'll just beat 'em up.

159
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,220
You can't!

160
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,390
If you do that, you'll cause a commotion and attract more enemies!

161
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,460
There's somebody there.

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,030
Who're you?

163
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,000
Straw Hat Luffy, I take it?

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,180
Yup, that's me.

165
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,130
Don't answer!

166
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,200
I've been waiting for you.

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll take you inside the palace.

168
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,530
Now all that's left is the final!

169
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,680
However...

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,460
The four commanders who were meant to participate in the finals are unfortunately unable to do so. {Halee: Shall we put "unfortunately" at the beginning of the sentence (with a comma, of course)?}

171
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,800
But you needn't worry!

172
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,930
Because our Colosseum's hero...

173
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,740
Mr. Diamante...

174
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,710
has been selected to fight in their stead!

175
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,300
Diamante!

176
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,330
Diamante-sama!

177
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
To the medical room!

178
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,150
Hurry!

179
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,760
Lucy!

180
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm in the finals too!

181
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,160
Lucy?

182
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,070
You're not him.

183
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,150
Hey you!

184
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,440
Show some respect, this man is...

185
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,580
You're Rebecca, right?

186
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,610
I know what you've been through.

187
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,390
Things might get chaotic out there, but I won't harm you.

188
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,430
If you look past the outward appearance...

189
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,800
this country somehow...

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,100
reminds me of the one where the three of us grew up.

191
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,830
The Royal Grounds

192
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,830
I have the entry permits.

193
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,730
Lift Leading to the Palace Gates

194
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,250
This lift can take you to the palace gates,

195
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,720
but if you're discovered, it's all over.

196
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,210
And most importantly...

197
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,410
Most importantly?

198
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,570
You're far too suspicious.

199
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,960
That, I did not account for!

200
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Aren't you the woman our cook went off with earlier? {Cecil: Is this the 1st time Zoro has referred to Sanji without an insult? XD}

201
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,750
Sanji?

202
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,100
Black Leg.{Copy-paste from 652}

203
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,010
My precious Violet-chan!{End copy-paste from 652}

204
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,220
He went off to save your ship, and then...

205
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
We know the rest.

206
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,050
Did you tell him that the Sunny was in danger?

207
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,810
And could it be that you gave Sanji-dono the map to the Toys' House that he passed on to me?

208
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,730
Yes, that was me.

209
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,470
Why would you do such a thing?

210
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,220
I was one of Doflamingo's subordinates.

211
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,300
What?! Mingo's?!

212
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,200
She's pretending to work for Doflamingo!

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,670
Wicca!

214
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,700
You remember me?

215
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,540
Did you forget about my powers? {Yet she didn't know Wicca was in Zoro's costume?}{Cecil: Holy shit, that's true!!}

216
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,970
I've been watching you the whole time.

217
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,560
I know that you've teamed up with the one-legged soldier who raised Rebecca after my sister died,

218
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
and that you're about to start fighting back.

219
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,690
I saw it all! {So does her clairvoyance-powers also allow her to HEAR the things she's spying on? I mean I have to assume so because otherwise it'd be a bit weird that she'd know the details of their plan. -Starfish}

220
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,830
Thank you for believing in my father.

221
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Viola-sama!

222
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,900
What?!

223
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,520
You're the king's daughter?!

224
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,180
That's in the past.

225
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,500
So if Rebecca is the king's granddaughter...

226
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,420
You're her mom?!

227
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,620
Rebecca is my niece.

228
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,390
She's my sister Scarlett's daughter.

229
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,240
Could this be...

230
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,500
A hidden door?

231
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,300
You were a ninja all along?!

232
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,480
This is an emergency passage known only to the Riku Royal Family.

233
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,680
Not even Doflamingo knows about this place.

234
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,220
What might this giant basket be?

235
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,330
A pulley to carry items. Look.

236
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,800
This place is really tall.

237
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,170
There are stairs as well.{Okay seriously, has Kin'emon been hanging around Legolas from Lord of the Rings lately? Because he sure seems to have picked up a knack for stating the glaringly obvious. -Starfish}

238
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,980
These stairs will take you to the Rampart Tower, where the palace gates are.

239
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,440
Luffy. You should take this stone and go to the top.

240
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,050
Oh, that is an inspired idea.

241
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,890
He can grab the chain at the top and come down with it, and we will get up quickly.

242
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,770
That's crazy.

243
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,180
Alright!

244
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,660
I'm off!

245
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,860
Hurry, Luffy!

246
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,480
Get on board, ninja-woman.

247
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,650
W-What?!

248
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,520
Toys' House

249
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,900
You're such a pain!

250
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,970
Franky...

251
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,030
Rocket...

252
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,210
Shoulder...

253
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
Launcher!

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,600
Run!

255
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,970
He's too dangerous!

256
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,340
And that pistol on his head is just for show after all!

257
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,480
Senor! Run!

258
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,790
Use your power to dive into the ground!

259
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,540
This is no time to be brushing your teeth with a shoe brush!

260
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,030
What?

261
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,450
I can't... {we should make this "I can't even..." ^^}

262
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,330
He's too hard-boiled!

263
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,760
Senor!

264
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,920
This is horrible!

265
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,120
Senor Pink!

266
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,110
Senor!

267
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,410
Why didn't he use his power to escape?

268
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,550
Don't get the wrong idea, kids.

269
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,320
My Swim Fruit power, that allows me to swim freely through the ground and the walls...

270
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,610
... does not exist so that I can escape from my enemies.

271
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,670
I...

272
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,490
swim when I want to.

273
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,520
That's freedom!

274
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,920
B-Brandy?

275
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,020
He's covered in blood, and I'm sure his bones are broken, yet...

276
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,430
He's disinfecting his wounds with brandy!

277
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,330
That's not it!

278
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,730
Senor, the reason you risked your life to take that attack face-on...

279
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,160
was because you've got an immobilized ally lying behind you, right?!

280
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,440
My stomach hurts -in.

281
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,810
Senor!

282
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,780
My heart feels like it's gonna burst!

283
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,810
That was so long ago. I don't even remember.

284
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,120
Hold me, Senor!

285
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,020
Hey Vise, can you stand?

286
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,860
I'm fine -in!

287
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,330
That guy is so hard-boiled.

288
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,680
Ton Ton!

289
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,520
My stomach hurts -in.

290
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,440
{\an8}I missed again -in.

291
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,110
Donquixote Family (Diamante Army ♦ Officer)
Machvise

292
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,110
{\an8}You sure are fast -in.

293
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,100
Shut it! What's your super deal?!

294
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,730
Hold it right there!

295
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,050
Cyborg Franky, from the Straw Hat Pirates!

296
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,130
The Navy has got the Toys' House completely surrounded!

297
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,740
What's the Navy doing here?

298
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,930
What? Didn't you know -in?

299
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,940
Another noisy bunch.

300
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,130
The Royal Palace

301
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,130
The Navy has made their move. {Cecil: "The Suit Chamber? Can we get a slightly different TL?}{Xemnas: It does sound weird, but it represents the 4 suits in trump cards and I don't know what else we could change it to.}

302
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,950
You made the right decision, Fujitora.

303
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,950
The Suit
Chamber

304
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,970
It's not like I'm on your side.

305
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,830
If the Straw Hats, as well as several other suspicious individuals, are on the move...

306
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,100
it is only natural for me to take action.

307
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:37,760
My men should fight in order to keep civilian casualties to a minimum.

308
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,220
If Straw Hat is truly after your head, he would probably cause major damage.

309
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:53,090
In that case, stopping him is my justice.

310
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,430
As for you... I'll deal with you later.

311
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,800
What?

312
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,740
I may be a newcomer who was conscripted into the Navy,

313
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,590
but there are things I want to do, now that I have the rank of Admiral.

314
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,680
To completely eliminate the system of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea.

315
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,200
There once was an incident when a certain pirate attempted to take over a country. {Cecil: I wonder if he means Arabasta?}

316
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,030
Had he succeeded, I'm sure that land would have become as shady as this one.

317
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,930
What about the balance between the three great powers?

318
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,120
Who knows? There's no way to tell without actually shattering it.

319
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,400
So...

320
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,220
If you don't behave...

321
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,880
your head will fly, Sir Heavenly Demon.

322
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,290
I feel like you're telling me to kill you while I have the chance.

323
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:02,360
Don't be hasty. Let's try to play nice for now.

324
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,530
I'm saying I'll protect your kingdom.

325
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,220
Whatever filth may be exposed in this country in the near future...

326
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,480
I won't be able to see it, so you needn't worry.

327
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,950
This is the year the World Council Meeting Reverie will be held. {Well, finally they acknowledged the name of the meeting. Seriously, this thing was mentioned rather frequently back during Fishman Island, but not once was it ever referred to as anything other than "the world council meeting". Even though the name "Reverie" was established in the manga the very first time it was brought up. -Starfish}{Cecil: In the manga here, they just call it the Reverie.}

328
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,240
For better or worse, the world will change.

329
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,590
It's time for the Corrida Colosseum battle tournament's...

330
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,580
final round!

331
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,840
I made it!

332
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,080
The entire country's eyes will be on this match! The special arena has been prepared!

333
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,820
Now we all wait for the five contestants to enter the arena!

334
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,900
This is where the fun begins.

335
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,880
Alright! Let's go, Marincolosseo!

336
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,240
It's Bartolomeo! Where'd you even get that name from?

337
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,240
Now, the first one to enter is...

338
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,250
It's him!

339
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,020
The rising star of this tournament, our very own Lucy, has arrived!

340
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,820
Watch me, Ace!
