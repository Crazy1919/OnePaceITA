1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,790
Fight, crash in, rise up

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are our Hard knock days

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Ordinary days won't quench our thirst

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,090
Here we go, always, don't run away

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,170
Let's go on living buffeted 
by the mighty winds

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,870
We're still far from our goal

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,690
We got to carry on Hard knock days

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,610
Let's do it again, yes, how many times, baby

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,110
do I have to get up to 
make my dream come true

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,720
Feels like the strength of my resolve is

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,420
put to the test everyday

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,690
Hey Let's go

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,460
I don't want to settle for 
small success, making excuses

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,960
Hey Let's go

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,660
The world I got out into is wild and lawless

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,180
Whiffing through the air, 
off-guard, reality countered me

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,470
Mercilessly, beat me, hit 
me, and even if I fall again

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,360
Oh

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,570
Only those who get back on 
their feet and look forward

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,820
will have the last laugh, only winner

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,120
(We gotta go, till we make 
it there, on the glory road)

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,540
Fight, shake it off, act strong

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,720
Those are our Hard knock days

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,800
A safe bet? There's no such thing

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,130
Here we go, always, be the best

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,180
and keep going without 
thinking of the consequences

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,810
Put all our wishes together

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,990
We got to carry on Hard knock days

29
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,350
The State of the War

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,940
Pica-sama's head's come off, and he's stopped moving!

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,590
What happened?!

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,180
Now's our chance!

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,500
I will take down Doflamingo!

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,420
I will!

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,900
No, I will!

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,180
They're coming again!

37
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,940
Stop them!  Don't let them reach the palace!

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,340
I-It's hopeless. The Colosseum fighters won't stop.

39
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,770
Look at them go!

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,740
I can't believe they're still resisting the young master.

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,800
They're crazy -in.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,320
Indeed.  Fujitora and his Navy grunts are right outside the palace.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,310
G, for Navy Grunts!

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,760
So it was the Straw Hats that stopped Pica after all.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,280
There are four different enemies approaching the palace right now.

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,620
Alright, here I am!

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,440
Transform!

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
The Smile factory!

49
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,320
Now it's time to smash the factory gates!

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Radical Beam!

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,360
Not that your attack could even scratch the factory, but...

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,030
I came to settle things with you, just to be safe.

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,640
You still wanna fight?!

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,600
That's what men do, kiddo.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,580
Senor!

56
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Please, Kyros! Come out and surrender!

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,700
If you don't come out, we'll come for you!

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,210
We don't want the money, but the slaughter won't stop until everyone's dead!

59
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,090
We have no choice! We want to put an end to this nightmare!

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,670
I wish to end this battle as quickly as possible.

61
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,740
I will not blame you for your judgment, but you've reminded me of why I must keep going!

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,060
Fire!  Don't let him escape!

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,680
I, too, have something I must do!

64
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,560
Huh?! Luffy-senpai ain't here!

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,580
Of course he isn't.

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,330
You knew?!

67
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,120
Luffy can't stay still in one place for five minutes.

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,680
Freedom!

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,380
I'd expect no less from the Pirate King!

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,680
Robin-san, they're still coming after us.

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,620
Once we reach the top, we've won!

72
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,550
We have to take the net down once we're done with it.

73
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,560
You did it!

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,540
Pardon me.

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,230
Big Sis!

76
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,560
King Riku, what is that stone monster?

77
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260
Why is the palace over there?

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,900
I found it.

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,250
Viola-san!

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,860
Viola!

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,920
I found it, Father.

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,260
The key to Trafalgar Law's handcuffs.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,790
I finally found it using my Clairvoyance.

84
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,600
We have to get it to him somehow.

85
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,870
Wait, Viola!  Why are you so concerned about them?

86
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,300
They're pirates!

87
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,130
That's right. They are the outlaws who will tear down the peaceful façade of this country!

88
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,970
Father, I'm betting everything on them, on the Straw Hat Pirates.

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,900
The pirate Doflamingo, who was given the rank of Warlord by the World Government,

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,480
has reigned over this country and caused us all so much pain.

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,500
I don't want any help from the World Government or the Navy, who pretend to be so righteous!

92
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,570
They can't hear...

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,030
The voices of the victims...

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,530
The enraged screams of this country.

95
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,640
The people in charge only ever hear what they want to hear.

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,680
At least the Straw Hats have passion behind their words, and they act according to their hearts!

97
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,250
I'll beat the crap out of Doflamingo!

98
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,560
So stay with my crewmates.

99
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,520
King Riku. King Riku!

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,050
Look at this man.

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,820
Aren't you the five-star?

102
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,160
That's right!  He is God Usopp, also known as Usoland!

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,520
This man fought without regard for his own safety...

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,290
And broke the spell on the toys that had endured for ten years!

105
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,060
He is our hero!

106
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,100
Usoland!

107
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,260
Usoland! Usoland!

108
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,370
And Luffyland is that superhero's captain!

109
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,360
King Riku, the Usolanders, aka the Straw Hat Pirates, are this country's shining star of hope!

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Even if they are pirates, we will trust them to the very end!

111
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,600
Viola-san, I'll take that key to Lucy.

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,220
Rebecca?!

113
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,660
I can't wait around here. Please let me go.

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,820
Rebecca...

115
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,420
Alright, great idea! Go to Luffy-senpai!

116
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,440
Of course, I'm coming along! Leave it to me!

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,240
Rebecca, if you go down there, you'll be hunted down as an outlaw in Doflamingo's game.

118
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,620
It won't be easy for you.

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,020
I'll be fine.

120
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,540
In that case, you could go via the rooftops!

121
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,010
Kabu-san and I will accompany you, so don't worry!

122
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,340
Via the rooftops?!

123
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,360
That's right! Inhel, I can leave the factory to you, right?

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
Of course!

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,960
According to our reconnaissance unit, Fraland is currently fighting Señor Pink.

126
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,380
We will help Fraland to free our captured friends and Princess Mancherie!

127
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,570
Good.

128
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,230
Then I'll see you later!

129
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,020
Everyone, there's no time to relax! Let's meet up back here at the royal grounds!

130
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,010
Now let's go!

131
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,080
Straw Hat Luffy... What a strange man.

132
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,640
Doflamingo!

133
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,320
How odd!

134
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,040
Ah! It's so odd!

135
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,910
How could those idiots from the Colosseum climb all the way up here?!

136
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,720
I thought there were thousands of marines down there!

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,180
I thought so too -in!

138
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,100
Vice Admiral Bastille and Navy HQ Admiral Fujitora, too!

139
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,780
How did they make their way through?!

140
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,960
Hey!  Is this all the Donquixote Family's got?!

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,700
We'll reach their boss soon!

142
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,560
I have a report!

143
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,960
Straw Hat Luffy has made it to the first l-

144
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,310
Rubber Gatling!

145
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,870
Outta my way!

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,220
We can't... c-compete with him...

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
Straw Hat!

148
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
They're dropping like flies!

149
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,760
T-The Colosseum fighters are coming up too!

150
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,590
Straw Hat!

151
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,400
I see them, Dellinger!

152
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,540
The marines are being stalled.

153
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,710
What?!

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,420
Is there no way to have you move aside?

155
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,690
That's right.

156
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,160
The Straw Hat Pirates and those warriors who support them...

157
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,100
I can't let anyone who's trying to hurt them...

158
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
Go any farther!

159
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,390
Is it the Revolutionary Army's job to protect pirates?

160
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,010
Yes, it is.

161
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,220
As a member of the Revolutionary Army, I won't let you through.

162
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,240
No, I got it wrong.

163
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,390
As a brother, I can't let you pass!

164
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,550
Oh?

165
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,540
And precisely whose brother might you be?

166
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,990
You bastard!

167
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,450
That won't hurt me.

168
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,820
I have the power of the Mera Mera Fruit.

169
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,890
Are you kidding me?!

170
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,660
The Navy can't be defeated by a single member of the Revolutionary Army!

171
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,330
Wait!  Don't do it!

172
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,620
Fire!

173
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,640
I said "Don't!"

174
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,550
This guy's fingers are freakishly strong!

175
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,140
They're claws!

176
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,040
Step back!

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,540
You guys can't beat him!

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,620
My fingers are...

179
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,530
Dragon claws!

180
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,030
The claws that rip apart those bigoted people in power!

181
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,200
He broke Vice-Admiral Bastille's Shark-Cleaver!

182
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,780
Why, you...

183
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,210
These claws can...

184
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,680
crush human skulls like an egg!

185
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,140
I have a problem.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,880
Since that bird cage thing is in the way, my meteor's going to be sliced, isn't it?

187
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,660
Run!

188
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,520
It's a meteorite!

189
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,320
Oops! What a fine mess!

190
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,830
It's all over the place...

191
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,320
I hope no civilians got hurt.

192
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,150
When you plan to bring down a meteorite, let us know, Isshou-san!

193
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,040
Oh, I'm sorry!  I brought one down!

194
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,620
Before you do it!

195
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,070
Do you know the position you're in?

196
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,580
I still haven't gotten used to my own power...

197
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,440
So I tried to ward it off.

198
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,480
Vice Admiral Bastille!

199
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,550
Vice Admiral!

200
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,840
You said you had to do this "as a brother" earlier, did you not?

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,050
Yeah.

202
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:33,380
The previous owner of the Mera Mera Fruit, Fire Fist Ace, who died at Marineford,

203
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,680
claimed that he was Straw Hat's adopted brother.

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,520
You mean you're his brother too?

205
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,900
We exchanged cups of brotherhood.

206
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,040
We're tied by an unbreakable bond.

207
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,920
What a troublesome bunch of brothers.

208
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,700
What kind of brothers are they?!

209
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,930
Straw Hat's brothers...

210
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,200
One of them was one of Whitebeard's commanders,

211
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,900
And the other one is the Revolutionary Army's second-in-command?!

212
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,210
Remember this...

213
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,900
If Luffy ever calls for my help,

214
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,880
I'll throw my rank aside and come to his aid, no matter where in the world we are.

215
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,960
I never...

216
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,560
{\an8}Newspaper: Ace is dead

217
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,340
Sabo-kun!

218
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,560
Sabo!

219
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,470
...want to go through that again!

220
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,040
I guess there's no point in asking you any more questions.

221
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,640
You don't care anyway, do you?

222
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't have any sake to go along with your stories.

223
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,140
I will...

224
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,760
protect Luffy!

225
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,320
New Royal Palace
First Step

226
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,290
Go! Go! Go!

227
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,600
That's the Reaper of the Colosseum!

228
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,170
Bring the bull down and get him bucked off, then he'll just be a prize in the game!

229
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,860
Don't underestimate Ucy!

230
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,960
Ucy! Go! Go!

231
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,940
He's the Reaper! Bow down!

232
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,900
Outta the way!

233
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,700
We're gonna go straight to the palace!

234
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,770
Ah!  Cabbage!

235
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
Straw Hat!  I'll be going on ahead of you!

236
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,660
Damn! I thought I was taking a shortcut!

237
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,160
You gotta run faster, Ucy!

238
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,360
Damn, everybody's catching up!

239
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,640
It's Hajrudin!

240
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,360
Outta my way! I have no business with you small fry!

241
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,180
I gotta keep moving!

242
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,850
Oh, no! They're gonna get ahead of me!

243
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,510
Shoot, shoot!

244
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,250
Here they come, again!

245
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,780
Don't wimp out! Shoot the bull!

246
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,290
We're gonna fall!

247
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,100
Stop messing with Straw Hat Luffy! You idiots!

248
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,820
Ra-Ra-Ra-Rampage!

249
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
Who's that?

250
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,480
Hey, don't be so cold.

251
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,060
I was a contender in Block C, same as you.

252
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,060
Assassins From Mogaro, Funk Brothers
Older Brother: Kelly (Fused With Younger Brother Bobby)

253
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,840
I'm Kelly Funk!

254
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,840
You were?

255
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,470
Hey, hey, hey!

256
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,340
We were saved by God Usopp like the others!

257
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,950
I found a shortcut to reach the higher levels.

258
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,270
You can make it straight to the Sunflower Field,
right in front of the Palace!

259
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,130
What? Really?!

260
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,300
I wanna help you!

261
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,370
Alright! We're gonna overtake Cabbage and the others in one spurt!

262
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,340
Hey, Straw Hatter!

263
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,120
When can I get rid of these handcuffs?

264
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,280
With these Sea Stone shackles, I might as well be going there just to get killed by Doflamingo.

265
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, it'll work itself out! Let's just go!

266
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,870
How can you be so sure?!

267
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,460
Go back to the plateau where we were before, then!

268
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,400
Huh? Why?

269
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,100
I'll look for the key!

270
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,580
This fight's gonna be win or die!

271
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,470
See? There's a shortcut!

272
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,780
Now, go ahead, Straw Hat. We'll guard the entrance!

273
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,610
Alright, thanks!

274
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,220
Ucy, let's go!

275
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,040
Take care.

276
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,700
Good job, Kelly Funk!

277
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,960
Make sure to guard the entrance! Thanks a lot!

278
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,620
They fell... What did they want, after all?

279
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,720
All right!  Don't worry and keep going, Ucy!

280
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,640
Straight to the Sunflower Field!

281
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,670
S-Straw Hat-san...

282
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,400
M-May you be victorious!

283
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,220
Your Snail Phone...

284
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,090
Answer it.

285
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,600
Hello?

286
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,880
This is Luffy!

287
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,760
The man who'll become the Pirate King!

288
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Luffy. It's me.

289
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,900
Robin!

290
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,920
We're still at the plateau you were at before.

291
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
Where are you?

292
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,180
We're at the first level of the other plateau and heading for the Sunflower Field.

293
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,990
The Sunflower Field is on the fourth level.

294
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,800
Viola found the key to Traf-kun's handcuffs.

295
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,940
Oh yeah?!

296
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,080
Nicoer, get it to me as soon as possible!

297
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,220
What should I do?!

298
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,090
Hello, this is Leo of the Dwarf Tribe.

299
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,730
We're gonna escort Rebecca-sama, the rooster-human and Robiland there at super high speed!

300
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,220
Let's meet up at the Sunflower Field on the fourth level.

301
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,410
What? How will you guys catch up with us?

302
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,300
I'll explain later! See you at the Sunflower Field!

303
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,180
See?  I told you it's gonna be alright!

304
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,920
It's just a coincidence!

305
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,900
All right!  Ucy, run!

306
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,860
Stop! He's going in the water!

307
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,100
What?! It's a dead end!

308
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,430
Go back! Hurry!

309
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,560
Ucy! Don't panic!

310
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,340
Somebody's coming.

311
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,690
This is just a slanted water well.

312
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,120
There's no shortcut in here.

313
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,200
It's you!

314
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,760
{\an1}Editing: Sewil
Timing: Datenshi
QC: Mr Luffy,
Galaxy 9000
Soundtracking: Halee

315
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,600
Doflamingo!
