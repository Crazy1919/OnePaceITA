Let's go! Shining! Running! Forever!

00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,700
Keep pushing forward!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070
Freedom is our only compass we need. -We are best friends-

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,920
A chain of excitements!

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,490
That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,230
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,700
and head for your goal, that's what adventure is all about!

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Let's go shining! Running! Forever!

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Spread open the chart of your dreams!

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,170
There's power hidden in the bond between us,

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,910
No one will come to save you.

30
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,320
No one can escape from this bird cage.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,980
Hello? Hello?

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,550
Communication with those outside of this island is also impossible.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,790
You will all die, without anyone outside ever realizing a thing.

34
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,930
Your crazed neighbors will continue to...

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,500
mercilessly attack everyone.

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,030
Someone stop me!

37
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,100
Please, not the children!

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,210
Be they your family, your friends, 
or even the citizens you strive to protect.

39
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,650
Stop it!

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,710
My body's moving on its own.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,050
Someone stop me!

42
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,490
Everyone, get away from me!

43
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,920
Isshou-san...

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,800
You can run and you can hide,

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,330
but there isn't a single safe haven inside this cage.

46
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,140
Executive Officer Pica

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,140
The bird cage's terror will continue for days on end.

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,180
Will everyone die first? 
Or will you all end this game first?

49
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,020
That bastard Doflamingo, 
what the hell's he trying to start?!

50
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,760
What's going on?!

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,460
The factory rose up and disappeared somewhere!

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,220
But this is our chance!

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,330
We can get outside!

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,030
The day we can escape this 
underground hell has come!

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,670
Thank you, God Usopp!

56
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,800
Let's go!

57
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,170
Robin-dono!

58
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,640
Kin'emon!

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,810
A-A steel breast-band.

60
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,650
Must be a foreign custom.

61
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,680
I like it.

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,690
R-Robin-senpai, make me your servant...

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,890
No, I misspoke.

64
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,960
There's something I want to ask you.

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,160
T-That man's nose...

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,930
It's exactly the same as that of the man who shot the flag on the Tower of Justice, Sogeking-senpai.

67
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,400
That's him. His name is Usopp.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,240
It's him!

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,210
Robin-senpai was moved by the actions of this crew,

70
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,410
who made enemies of the world for the sake of one of their crewmates.

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,720
Together, they're the star duo of Enies Lobby!

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,220
Yes, yeah, yes!

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,190
What are you getting all excited about, you psycho? Shut up already!

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,090
Someone like that broke my arm...

75
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,330
I hand them over to you.

76
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,400
Though they may be small, they are great warriors.

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,530
Thank you, Topknotland.

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,070
They were unconscious in the palace corridors.

79
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,070
They put their lives on the line for the captain.

80
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,040
Kabu-san, Rampo, you did a great job.

81
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,550
Someone stop me! My body won't listen to me!

82
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,190
This is just like that night ten years ago.

83
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,990
I finally understand.

84
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,830
King Riku and the royal army were being controlled...

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,670
by Doflamingo!

86
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,910
Scream, hate, suffer.

87
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,080
You are all innocent victims.

88
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,150
Help...

89
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,260
Stop it, Doflamingo!

90
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,100
Think about it.

91
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,400
Will you come kill me?

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:33,470
Or fight alongside me to bring judgment upon the twelve fools who stand against me?

93
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,650
If you choose incorrectly, the game won't end.

94
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,250
For each star you get 100 million.

95
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,850
100 million belly?!

96
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,860

I'd forgotten about him.

110
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,670
The invincible gladiator.

111
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,440
There are some pirates there as well.

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,670
The Straw Hat Pirates.

113
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,210
The Family commander Violet... was Princess Viola?!

114
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,880
And the main offenders of each organization...

115
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,980
are all three-stars!

116
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,620
300 million!

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,220
Law and Straw Hat.

118
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,660
That's the alliance that just shook the world.

119
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,320
K-King Riku?

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,590
King Riku, you're alive!

121
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,000
There's one of the revolutionary army's top guns too!

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
He's the chief of staff.

123
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,130
Information spreads fast.

124
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,530
Me too?!

125
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,770
T-Thank god he didn't find out about me.

126
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,880
Furthermore, there's the man who has angered me the most today.

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,990
He's the one who forced you all into this cruel game.

128
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,490
The one who kills him...

129
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,690
gets 500 million!

We can live the rest of our lives in luxury!

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,840
F...{Yeah maybe this didn't NEED to be added... But I'm PRETTY sure the noises he be making here are attempts at saying "five hundred million?!" -Starfish}

134
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,080
T-This is bad, Usoland's...

135
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,820
Five stars!

136
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,220
There are some one-stars and a three-star guy there as well. {Cecil: there are actually THREE one stars, not two(Rebecca, Robin and Kinemon) so I'm changing this to say some}{...Yeah... On one hand he literally SAYS "two", but on the other hand, you're right, there are in fact three. -Starfish}

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,990
Sabo-kun, what should we do?

138
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,830
We're escaping above ground.

139
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,390
Everyone, hurry!

140
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,260
God Usopp! Sorry, but please die!

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,130
Five stars is 500 million!

142
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,870
T-Those guys were worshiping me a minute ago!

143
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,870
Dammit, run away.

144
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,110
Understood.

145
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
There's one over there.

146
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,550
It's the one-star samurai.

147
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,880
A hundred million belly!

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,690
How troublesome.

149
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,070
A-According to the dwarves, this is the scrapyard.

150
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,360
Are you really down here, Kanjuurou?

151
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,330
The 100 million is mine!

152
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,330
To hell with it!

153
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,270
He fell!{Yeah, he did in fact jump, but they seem to think he just tripped. The word they used is literally "fell". -Starfish}

154
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,640
The samurai fell into the hole!

155
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,810
You don't have time to hesitate.

156
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,480
Time is ticking,
 people are dying, and the town is burning. {lahdedah}{OXFORD COMMAS, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!! -kae}

157
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
What should we do?

158
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,790
We've only just realized that King Riku was innocent...

159
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,900
If all of us were to go up against him, then maybe we could kill Doflamingo.

160
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,860
He's not alone though.

161
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,140
To defeat Doflamingo, we'd have to go through two thousand members of the Donquixote Family.

162
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,110
Then what are we supposed to do?

163
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,680
King Riku is among those twelve.

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,980
We shouldn't have to kill them.

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,350
Restraining them will do. There's only twelve of them.

166
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,790
We have no choice.

167
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,420
We have to fight.

168
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,690
Where'd Cyborg Franky disappear to?

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,170
Barrier!

170
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,470
Don't follow us.

171
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,140
Keep going toward the surface!

172
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,880
Zoro?

173
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,810
Yeah.

174
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,050
Where are you?

175
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,250
Is that Robin?

176
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm with Luffy and the others right now.

177
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,650
It's called the "Royal Grounds".

178
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,960
We've been put in a really aggravating situation.

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,890
Robin? Did you see that?

180
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,160
Mingo's really annoying.

181
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,860
But Usopp's bit was hilarious.

182
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,600
What the hell, Luffy!

183
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,810
Rebecca was on that list as well, do you think she's okay?

184
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,770
Rebecca's...

185
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm right here, Lucy.

186
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh, perfect timing.

187
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,350
The soldier's right here...

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,750
Where'd the soldier go?

189
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,750
Don't tell me, he...

190
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,720
It's an outlaw, kill him!

191
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,790
Did Soldier-san...

192
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,160
Did Soldier-san turn back into a human?

193
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,030
Lucy, what kind of person is he?

194
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,530
What kind of person?

195
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,140
That one-legged soldier is...

197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,480
your dad!

198
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,620
He's the guy from the statue in the Colosseum!

199
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,160
I-I couldn't protect her. {copy paste from 651}

200
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,500
I knew it...

201
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,100
Soldier-san is valiant...

202
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,470
... and he will always watch over you.

203
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,810
I'm happy for you.

204
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,850
The soldier guy went somewhere, but listen, Rebecca.

205
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,450
Don't cry yet.

206
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,180
I won't let the soldier die.

207
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,650
Make sure you stay safe.

208
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,320
Sorry I couldn't give you the Flame Fruit that you wanted to eat.

209
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,900
But in exchange, I'll beat the crap out of Doflamingo!

210
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,160
So stay with my crewmates.

211
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll end this game right away.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,240
Stay alive!

213
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,970
You got it?!

214
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,710
Yeah!

215
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,780
Luffy, tell me who's there on your end.

216
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
Here we have...

217
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,220
Do you understand, Straw Hatter?

218
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:56,890
Our plan was to destroy the Smile factory to make Doflamingo and Kaidou clash.

219
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:04,670
If you take out Doflamingo now, Kaidou's rage at losing the Smiles will be directed at us.

220
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,210
It'll mean we have to fight an enraged Emperor!

221
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,080
We can worry about that later.

222
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,220
Just look at this country! I've gotta do something!

223
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,760
Find the outlaws!

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,930
If we want to survive, we have to catch them!

225
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,600
If you find any outlaws, let everyone know right away!

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,770
Somebody, please stop me!

227
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,910
That was close. Don't let your guard down.

228
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,650
Get moving.

229
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,190
Isshou-san, you're not going to capture Doflamingo?

230
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,230
We have to restrain as many of the people running rampant as possible.

231
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,530
Besides, our target here is the alliance between Straw Hat and Law.

232
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,270
Contact all our squadrons.

233
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,970
Wait, I'm still in handcuffs.

234
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,300
They'll come off soon enough.

235
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,110
As if!

236
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,380
I'll get the key.

237
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
I promise I'll find it, and-

238
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
What route are we taking?

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Straight ahead!

240
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,950
He's not planning to jump, is he?!

241
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,160
Just you wait, Doflamingo!

242
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,170
Droves of people are pouring out from under the Colosseum!

243
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,210
It looks like all the upheaval caused the underground and the surface to merge!

244
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,350
These must be the people who were forced to work in that underground port!

245
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,110
Soldiers...

246
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,780
Officials...

247
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,620
Pirates!

248
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,760
I... I can't believe so many people were enslaved without anyone knowing!

249
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,730
Maynard, who told you to infiltrate the battle tournament?

250
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't go off on your own like that.

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,070
You're lucky you're still alive.

252
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,140
But Bastille-san,

253
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,810
doing so let me see the whole picture of the tournament.

254
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,310
{\an8}If we apprehend Doflamingo,

255
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,450
Navy HQ Vice-Admiral
Maynard the Pursuer (Participant in the tournament)

256
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,450
{\an8}the balance of the world could shift!

257
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,690
Underground
Trading Port

258
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,920
This is...

259
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,130
a trading vessel from the Kingdom of Biggschots, disguised as a pirate ship.

260
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,070
The shadows from several countries have come together in this port.

261
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,570
Please, stop!

262
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
I-I'm so sorry!

263
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,570
Darling!

264
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,650
Everybody, run!

265
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,080
Why, Isshou-san?!

266
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,820
Doflamingo can't be allowed to be a Warlord any longer!

267
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,620
We should capture him right now!

268
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:22,030
I'm sure the Navy has been doing the same thing all along.

269
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:27,410
You've been in this organization a long time, right, Vice-Admiral?

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,580
Have you always ignored...

271
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,750
these enraged screams?

272
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,420
They're not crying. They're furious!

273
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,060
Do you think the World Government...

274
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,100
are gods?!

275
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,740
You will obey my decision.

276
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,710
Law and the others are after the Smiles, right?

277
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,190
{\an8}Hey, Doffy, shouldn't we protect the factory?

278
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,420
The Land Where The Royal Palace Is (The Sunflower Field)

279
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,620
{\an8}They'll never get in anyway. It's made of Sea Stone.

280
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,360
And I've got the keys right here.

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Young master?!

282
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,470
Are you sure?!

283
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,540
Why give the enemy hope?

284
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,010
How weak you are. 
 You couldn't even protect one little girl,

285
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,110
Trebol.

286
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,380
Shut up, old G-zer!{The Japanese line is "Ji-G", a pun on "jijii", aka a derogatory term for old men. This seemed like a pretty good way of adapting that pun IMO -Starfish} She's not really a little girl, you know!

287
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,820
Hey, hey, Doffy!

288
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,990
I'm really sorry about Sugar.

289
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:58,030
How could I have known that a man with both arms and legs tied could make her faint?

290
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,060
It was inconceivable!

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,130
It's the same with the Flame Fruit.

292
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,870
I had no idea that the Revolutionary Army's second-in-command was fighting in the tournament.

293
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,540
It was inconceivable!

294
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,180
No excuses, you disgraceful fools!

295
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,880
G, for disGraceful!

296
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,620
It's in the past.

297
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,560
Blaming you won't change anything.

298
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,260
Right? Our boss is the best!

299
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,430
Take that, Lao G!

300
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,330
If you insist, I will accept your forgiveness.

301
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,200
But Doffy, now the Navy will give us trouble.

302
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,840
What should we do about Fujitora?

303
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I've settled matters with him. The Navy won't go after us.

304
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,250
But once Fujitora's use runs out,

305
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,250
we'll have to get rid of him.

306
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,020
To completely eliminate the system of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

307
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,700
Nothing good will come from letting him live.

308
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,000
Though, getting rid of him won't be easy.

309
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,800
The Navy and the pirates...

310
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,000
You could just let me go all out...

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,970
That voice!

312
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,370
It's so...

313
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,380
... and I could wipe them all out on my own!

314
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,250
Donquixote Family Top Commander
Pica♠

315
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,420
His voice is so high!

316
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,720
How can that voice be coming out of that body?

317
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,490
I can't... I just can't get used to that voice!

318
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,360
But if I so much as giggle, I'm dead!

319
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
There's no need to rush.

320
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,110
Now listen. This game is something of a royal election.

321
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:57,450
I have asked the populace if the Rikus or the Donquixotes are more fit to rule the country.

322
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,520
The citizens will choose their king.
They have that right.

323
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,860
We simply crush the ones who come for us, and enjoy watching the rest kill each other.

324
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,360
But that'll take forever!

325
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,030
Doffy, I-

326
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,640
I-I'm so sorry, Pica-sama!

327
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,340
Please forgive him. He's new!

328
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,240
He just wasn't expecting you to sound so...

329
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

330
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,680
You're getting buried alive in stone!

331
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,520
Wait, Pica-sama!

332
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,990
Gatling Girl!

333
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
If you kill him, there won't even be a corpse left!

334
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,800
His family wouldn't appreciate that.

335
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm sorry, Baby 5.

336
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,580
My mother died when I was eight.

337
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,380
I killed my father when I was ten.

338
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:15,630
My commanders are my family, who've been with me through thick and thin for many years.

339
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,530
They're the only ones I have.

340
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,130
I will never allow anyone to laugh at my family.
Do you understand?

341
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,530
Y-Yes, Sir!

342
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,450
Restrain everyone you find running wild!

343
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,950
Find the Straw Hats and Trafalgar Law!

344
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,020
Yes, Sir!

345
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,520
It looks like the Navy has no intention of fighting us -in.

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,460
So they still insist on treating the young master like a Warlord.

347
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,030
Doesn't that seem a bit too thoughtful?

348
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,400
They must be scared of the bird cage too!

349
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,740
Anyway, I can't believe that pervert had the strength to run away.

350
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,180
Where did he go?

351
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,650
That's gotta be the Smile factory.

352
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,760
It's sticking out like a sore thumb. 
 It's like it wants to get hit by my beam!

353
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,160
A balloon's falling down -in.

354
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,000
A balloon?

355
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,880
Law!

356
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,380
You've got some nerve showing your face here, you little brat!

357
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,350
Big Bro Law? I'd almost forgotten you existed.

358
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,290
Straw Hat Luffy!

359
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,060
Trafalgar Law!

360
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,990
The Pirate Hunter!

361
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,200
This is one hell of a place to land!

362
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,170
Straw Hat!
  Once I'm free, I'm killing you first!

363
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,710
We'd be in trouble no matter where we landed.

364
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,580
This entire country is our enemy.

365
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,440
Anyway, let's run!

366
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,350
Yeah!

367
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,450
After them!

368
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,720
Zoro, not that way!

369
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,150
This isn't the right way either, Straw Hat!

370
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,290
Outlaws!

371
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,490
There are two three-stars and a two-star!

372
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,800
He got me! This weird guy just swam in the ground!

373
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,500
Now, Vise!

374
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,570
Run! He's a super-weight man!

375
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,570
Dammit! Let go of my legs!

376
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,810
Ton-Ton! Ten-Ton Vise!

377
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,180
I can't get free! My legs are stuck!

378
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,220
I won't miss this time!

379
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,520
Pistol High-Heel!

380
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,000
Heavy!

381
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,870
Ow!

382
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,900
Alright! My feet are free!

383
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,840
Keep it together! Now let's move!

384
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,740
We'll be taking your combined bounty of eight hundred million!

385
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,040
Prepare yourselves!

386
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Fire!

387
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,520
Three-stars and a two-star!

388
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,990
This is such a pain! 
 Should we really cut them down?

389
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,400
There are civilians in there!

390
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,100
Alright, I'll use my Haki to...

391
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,900
Cease this.

392
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,040
No matter how many weak bullets you fire, you won't hit them.

393
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,120
A Navy Admiral...

394
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,420
The old gambler!

395
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
Usopp, the five-star, is in the Colosseum!

396
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,500
There he is! After him!

397
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,070
Get him!

398
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,070
Just leave me alone already!

399
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:28,110
With this altered geography, the Colosseum wall is pushed up against the royal grounds.

400
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,150
We can climb up there to meet with the others.

401
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,180
I found them!

402
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,620
Rebecca, go on ahead.

403
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Robin-san!

404
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,290
You're mine!

405
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
Bartolomeo!

406
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,030
I'm so honored to have you address me by name, Robin-senpai!

407
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,840
I-I'll stop the enemies here.

408
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,240
Go on ahead with Sogeking-senpai.

409
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,570
Thank you.

410
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,580
Robin-senpai thanked me!

411
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,320
Now I'm really fired up!
I ain't letting anyone chase you any further!

412
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,920
What is he planning to do now?

413
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,630
I-It's happening again!

414
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,500
I-It can't be...

415
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,260
That's...

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,330
He's finally...

417
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,900
Once that guy shows up, it's all over!

418
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,070
Nobody can fight him!

419
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,430
What the hell is that?!

420
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,110
A giant...

421
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,940
He's way too big!

422
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,980
That's...

423
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,140
Pica!

424
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,570
Pica-sama!

425
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,620
Now, everyone who dares to oppose our family...

426
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,170
I will take you on!

427
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,200
That voice! It's so high!

428
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh, come on!

429
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,150
It doesn't fit him at all!

430
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
What a weird voice!

431
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,930
Straw Hat!
