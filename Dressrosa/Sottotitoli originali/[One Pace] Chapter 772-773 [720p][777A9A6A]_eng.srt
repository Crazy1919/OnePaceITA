00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,700
What are you gonna do?

1165
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,100
The ground is rippling like a flag.

1166
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,900
How pathetic! Just grovel in the dust, Toy Soldier!

1167
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,670
Cabbage and Lomeo

1168
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,800
I get it!  It all makes sense now.

1169
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,920
The toy soldier who was crying and screaming so disgracefully back then...

1170
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,360
That was you!

1171
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,770
Scarlett!

1172
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,440
You're the late Scarlett's husband and Rebecca's father.

1173
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,140
This is great!

1174
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,660
Looks like you and I are bound by karma, eh Kyros?

1175
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,460
That's right!

1176
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,580
That's why I came here!

1177
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,940
Oh, oops... That was a good move!

1178
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,640
But it's a steel cape. Watch out!

1179
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,100
Vipera Glaive!

1180
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,100
{\an8}Snake Sword

1181
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,880
Father!

1182
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,340
Father, I'll fight, too!

1183
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,320
Yeah!  Fight, Rebecca!  I'll kill you!

1184
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,420
I wanna watch Kyros lose both his wife and daughter!

1185
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,980
It's okay, Rebecca!

1186
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,660
Let me protect you, as well as atone for Scarlett's death!

1187
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,680
Let me compensate for teaching you how to fight!

1188
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,030
I've been living with regret and shame for it until today!

1189
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Now that I've become human once more,
I will never let my daughter swing a sword again!

1190
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,640
Th-This is terrible...

1191
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,650
Royal Palace Grounds - Second Level

1192
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,300
Lao G-sama was taken out!

1193
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,660
That's some power.

1194
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,480
I've heard that name before.

1195
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,260
The Happou Navy from the Flower Kingdom.

1196
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,920
I'll keep it in mind.

1197
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,600
Anyone can become our enemy at any time.

1198
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,940
Gramps! Hey, Gramps!

1199
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't die, Gramps!

1200
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
Then I'll reserve two ceremonial halls, honey!

1201
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,360
Ceremonial halls?! Honey?!

1202
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,560
For the wedding and...

1203
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,060
the funeral.

1204
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't write us off!

1205
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,360
Royal Palace Grounds - Third Level

1206
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,040
Why are you crawling and slinking around?

1207
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,680
Now, fight me, Gladius!

1208
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't push your luck.

1209
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,080
What the...

1210
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,980
No! Gladius-sama, you can't!

1211
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,900
The ground is inflating!?

1212
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,420
You know what'll happen, don't you?

1213
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,440
You were preparing for this?

1214
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,080
Watch out!

1215
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,810
Run!

1216
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Hey, Bartolomeo! Everything's gonna blow!

1217
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,440
Let me inside your barrier!

1218
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,570
No way!

1219
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,420
What?!

1220
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,260
If I open it, Robin-senpai and I will be in danger, and our enemies will come inside as well!

1221
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
No, open it! I'm on your side!

1222
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,440
Gladius-sama! We'll be caught up in it, too...

1223
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,620
It'll be fine. You guys are elite, right?

1224
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,020
Open up!

1225
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Pop Rock...

1226
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,830
Festival!

1227
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,560
Goodbye, Cavendish.

1228
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,740
If I'd been outside right now, I'd be a dead man.

1229
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,520
You ingrate!

1230
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,540
Why'd you wait so long to let me in?!

1231
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,920
I thought I was gonna die!

1232
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,240
What's wrong with you?!

1233
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,260
That's no way to talk to the guy who just saved your life!

1234
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,640
I was covering you before that! Now we're even!

1235
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,440
I've had enough! I'm going to attack them!

1236
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,420
Let me out!

1237
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,620
What?!

1238
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,840
I just let you in, and now you want out?!

1239
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,900
Since you came in, why don't you stay for a while, you selfish fool?!

1240
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,220
Is this an inn?!

1241
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,980
Offense must come after defense!
That's how it should be!

1242
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,360
I won't let you in next time!

1243
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
Let me in again when I'm in danger!

1244
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,960
You're so unreasonable!

1245
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,360
I'll get you for this later!

1246
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,890
Oh yeah, Robin-senpai!

1247
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,770
Oh, great!  She's alright!

1248
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,610
I'll be there, Rebecca!  Stay safe!

1249
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,960
Nico Robin, you cumbersome woman!

1250
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,140
I won't let you get in the way of the top commanders anymore!

1251
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,300
Catapult Pop!

1252
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,180
Bari-ability: Racket!

1253
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,280
He's still alive?!

1254
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,540
Advance! Robin-senpai!

1255
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,640
Rooster-kun!

1256
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,430
Thank you!

1257
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,060
S-She made an eye gesture, a.k.a. a wink!

1258
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,580
I'm so grateful!

1259
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,760
Did it mean, "Good job, Rooster-kun! You can become my slave if you want"?!

1260
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,940
No no, you're being too presumptuous, Bartolomeo!  You're asking for too much!

1261
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,340
But!

1262
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,370
I'm getting real fired up!

1263
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,880
Cavendish, you were in the barrier, too?!

1264
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,880
Too bad, Gladius!

1265
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,630
Blade of Beauty: Blue...

1266
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,740
Bracchium...

1267
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,030
Gladius-sama!

1268
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
Bartolomeo!

1269
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,280
Barrier Bulls!

1270
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
The barrier is charging at us!

1271
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,660
Robin-senpai! To a man, your eye gesture is worth risking his life!

1272
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,020
Stop, Bartolomeo! Can't you see I'm here?!

1273
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,500
Sorry, Cabbage! But there's a reason I can't stop!

1274
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,760
And that is?!

1275
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm... so fired up!

1276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,820
I'm... so fired up!

1277
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't care!

1278
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,300
What are you talking about, you fool?!
Stop now!

1279
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,660
No can do!

1280
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Dellinger!

1281
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,340
Haven't you cleaned up the second level yet?!

1282
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,040
Gladius! What are you doing?

1283
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,260
I'll be finished here soon!

1284
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,240
Come and help on the third level!

1285
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,720
Nico Robin is trying to make her way up!

1286
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,520
My hands are full with these two idiots!

1287
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,960
Roger! Sounds like fun!

1288
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,720
Didn't I tell you...

1289
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,440
to pay attention?!

1290
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,540
Boy, you're so persistent, you Longhand!

1291
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,680
I did think those protrusions on your shoulders were weird.

1292
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,560
You got a hole in your damn stomach!

1293
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,400
So why don't you drop dead already, Martial Arts Champion?

1294
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,290
I can't do that!

1295
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,260
You gotta have a sense of duty and obligation in a man's world!

1296
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,580
I must fight for the sake of those who have already fallen!

1297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,880
That's so not you.

1298
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,060
If you played dead or something, I would've spared your life.

1299
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,980
How will staying on your feet help?!

1300
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,360
Maybe I can buy some time.

1301
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,660
We've gotta keep you guys from getting in Straw Hat's way...

1302
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,700
so that he can defeat Doflamingo!

1303
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,680
We'll do it together!

1304
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,980
There's no such thing as victory attained by one person alone, kid!

1305
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,940
So you guys are trying to attain victory
by sacrificing your lives.

1306
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,900
That's how vermin act!

1307
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,480
The strong don't heed obligations!

1308
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm no ordinary human, either.

1309
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,820
Don't underestimate my Fighting Fish lineage!

1310
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,120
3rd step

1311
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Gladius! I'm here!

1312
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
Where are you?

1313
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,340
Gladius!

1314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,520
Dellinger, stay on the lower level!
It's dangerous here!

1315
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,980
We have one troublesome enemy!

1316
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,460
That doesn't sound like you!

1317
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,180
Gladius, nobody can oppose us when we fight together-

1318
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
Dellinger!

1319
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,480
Damn!  Dellinger...

1320
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,760
What the...

1321
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,580
What just happened?!

1322
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,240
That brat with horns and all the other enemy soldiers...

1323
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,840
He took 'em all down.

1324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,880
There's this kinda scary guy on the other side of the barrier!

1325
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,160
Wh-Who's that?

1326
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,400
He looks like Cabbage, but his face is totally different.

1327
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,380
This is exactly the same thing that happened in the Block D match at the Colosseum.

1328
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,480
Oh my, everyone's gone down!

1329
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,760
That was this guy's doing?

1330
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,000
Those clothes are undoubtedly Cavendish's.

1331
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,180
But the face looks undoubtedly like somebody else-dish.

1332
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,540
So what kinda-vendish is he?

1333
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,720
T-That scared me!

1334
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,840
He was so fast, I couldn't see him!

1335
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,660
Well, no matter how fast you can move, it's useless against my ability!

1336
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,980
What the hell're you thinking?!

1337
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,500
What's happened to you?!
If you take this joke too far...

1338
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,640
Hey! Who did you just glance at?!

1339
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,040
Don't do anything stupid! Hey! Hey!

1340
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,520
Don't!

1341
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't go after Robin-senpai!

1342
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,300
Your speed is useless against me.

1343
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,680
Your face has become quite ugly.

1344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,780
Cabbage-kun, did you want something from me?

1345
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm worried about Rebecca, so I must hurry to the top.

1346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,280
Wow! Cool! She stopped him!

1347
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,920
Dobin-sedbai!

1348
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,460
I knew it was too audacious of a weakling like me to try to protect you!

1349
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,740
Wait, Hakuba!

1350
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,960
I didn't give you permission to come out!

1351
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm sorry, Nico Robin.

1352
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,600
I almost cut you.

1353
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,200
So that was this "Hakuba" I've heard about.

1354
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,140
Your other personality...

1355
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
That's right...

1356
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,660
He's bad news.

1357
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,240
He kills indiscrimi-

1358
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,300
Your hands and feet...

1359
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,600
I'll chop them and what's left of you into bits, Nico Robin!

1360
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,620
I'll slice up everything!

1361
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,020
Stay away, Hakuba! I won't let you take control!

1362
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,820
Shut up! Stay asleep, Cavendish!

1363
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,160
You don't even know what I'm fighting for!

1364
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,520
I'll take care of this!

1365
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,160
I'll just rip everything to shreds!

1366
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,300
There's no point if I don't do it!

1367
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,010
Don't care! I'll show them a bloodbath!

1368
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,360
It's like two people having a conversation! Does he have a split personality?!

1369
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,140
I will!

1370
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,200
No, me!

1371
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,550
I'll do it!

1372
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,550
No, I will!

1373
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,380
I will!

1374
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,850
Me, me, me! {Me too.Me three}

1375
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,970
I will, I will, I will !

1376
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,680
Me!

1377
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,240
I will!

1378
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,940
Me!

1379
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,520
I will!

1380
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,350
Me!

1381
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,980
I will!

1382
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,020
Me!

1383
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,060
I will!

1384
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,060
Me!

1385
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,220
He's gone half-and-half!

1386
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,620
Shut up, Hakuba!

1387
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,980
I'm the only Cavendish!

1388
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,460
You were half-and-half just a second ago!

1389
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,280
Okay, it's alright now, Nico Robin.

1390
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,620
Why don't you let go of me?

1391
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,540
You expect me to trust you after seeing that?

1392
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,780
Huh?

1393
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
Let's just end this now.

1394
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,120
I'll blow you up along with the wall!

1395
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,620
This'll do far worse than just throw you into the air.

1396
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,140
You're not getting away in one piece!

1397
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,340
That bastard!

1398
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
He'll rupture us along with the wall!

1399
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,180
We need to get down right now, Nico Robin!

1400
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,340
No! Something could happen to Rebecca while I'm doing that...

1401
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,400
Leave this to me!

1402
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,300
I won't let him harm Robin-senpai!

1403
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,720
Good judgment.

1404
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,420
Yes, if you take me down, you can stop the wall from rupturing.

1405
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
Punk Hair!

1406
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,160
What's this? It went numb.

1407
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,700
Those hairs are poison needles.

1408
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,390
What?!

1409
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,460
Bartolomeo!

1410
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,240
I have the power of the Rupture Fruit.

1411
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,540
In other words, I'm a rupture man from head to toe.

1412
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,660
If you do something to me, my body will explode...

1413
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,420
and thousands more of the poison needles that just caught you...

1414
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,180
will pierce through those two up there!

1415
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,000
But if you don't take me down, you can't stop the wall from rupturing.

1416
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,900
What are you gonna do?

1417
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,700
My body's explosion will be so powerful that you can't survive, of course.

1418
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,640
Then Robin-senpai will suffer no matter what I do!

1419
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,860
You're a fast learner, Bartolomeo.

1420
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,140
Think, Bartolomeo!

1421
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,080
What's the most important thing for me to keep safe here?

1422
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,320
That's obviously...

1423
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,900
Robin-senpai's body.

1424
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,840
To stop the wall from rupturing,

1425
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,640
I've gotta take that hedgehog down.

1426
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,080
But then, all those poison needles will fly straight toward Robin-senpai!

1427
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,040
What should I do? Think!

1428
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,860
Think harder, Bartolomeo!

1429
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,100
Oh yeah!

1430
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,760
There's a completely expendable guy up there with Robin-senpai!

1431
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,640
Hey, Cabbage! I'll bring down the hedgehog here, so...

1432
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,890
you protect Robin-senpai from the poison needles by using your whole body as a shield!

1433
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,640
Hey...

1434
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Hey, Cabbage!

1435
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,380
Shut up, rooster!

1436
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,160
The evil one came out again!

1437
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,580
Just when I need him the most, he's useless!

1438
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,700
Robin-senpai's in danger from all sides!

1439
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,520
What do I do?! What do I do?!

1440
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,820
Oh yeah!

1441
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,710
Will you face me, Bartolomeo?

1442
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,420
I can only put up one barrier at a time.

1443
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,080
That's the drawback, but I don't care.

1444
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,460
Robin-senpai! If I can save you, I won't hesitate!

1445
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,460
Barrier Ball!

1446
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,540
Go ahead, blow up if you like!

1447
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,760
We're inside my unbreakable barrier!

1448
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,600
This fool...

1449
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,800
Rooster-kun! Don't tell me you...

1450
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,180
You were prepared to take me down with you?!

1451
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,620
You insolent little...

1452
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,500
Fashion Pop!

1453
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,700
Rooster-kun!

1454
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,360
That serves you right, hedgehog!

1455
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Now the wall won't rupture!

1456
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,480
I did it...

1457
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,300
I protected Robin-senpai.

1458
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,760
Too bad for you, fool.

1459
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,620
You missed by just a few centimeters.

1460
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,710
It wasn't my throat that you stabbed.  It was my shoulder.

1461
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,420
I-I missed his vital organs?!

1462
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,940
Sure, he was inflated and I couldn't tell if it was his neck or shoulder but...

1463
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,760
Dammit!

1464
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,400
You have Devil Fruit powers too,
so you know the deal.

1465
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,800
As long as I'm conscious...

1466
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,060
The wall rupture won't stop!

1467
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,780
Watch closely as your friends are blown asunder!

1468
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,760
Damn, I'm such a fool!

1469
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,960
Nico Robin, I'm sorry!

1470
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,060
I brought Hakuba under control!

1471
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm Cavendish now!

1472
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,360
But I left half of me as Hakuba.

1473
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,040
Let go of me! I'll kill you!

1474
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,520
I'll take you to the Sunflower Field with Hakuba's speed!

1475
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,020
I'll use Hakuba's abilities!

1476
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,980
We have no other options! Let go of me!

1477
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,810
Trust me!

1478
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,840
Which one's talking?

1479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,610
No time to think!

1480
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,280
Hurry up!

1481
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740
D-Don't!

1482
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Pop Rock...

1483
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,860
Super Arena!

1484
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,160
Robin-senpai!

1485
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,160
This barrier of yours is quite convenient.

1486
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,410
Look.

1487
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,760
There's nothing left of either one.

1488
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,740
Huh?!

1489
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,760
Why did you stop me?!

1490
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,960
It's your own body!

1491
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,100
If so, why don't you...

1492
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,080
listen to me every now and then?!

1493
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,640
Cien Fleur! Spider Net!

1494
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,640
{\an8}Hundred Flower Spider Net

1495
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,740
You stopped Hakuba's sword for me, didn't you, Cabbage-kun?

1496
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,040
You're such a confusing man.

1497
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,560
Impossible!

1498
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,180
How could they escape that rupture?!

1499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,280
Compared to him, I'm pathetic!

1500
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,600
Divine Homage Fist!

1501
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,440
Luffy-senpai...

1502
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,640
My skills aren't good enough now...

1503
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,390
But I'll become stronger and stronger...

1504
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,040
Barrier...

1505
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,540
I swear, that someday...

1506
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,490
I'll become a man who can help you!

1507
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,520
Pistol!

1508
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,890
I barely won using my senpai's power...

1509
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,760
Anyway, I never want to...

1510
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,120
work with that annoying guy again!

1511
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,000
4th Step
Sunflower Hill

1512
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,740
It's quite noisy down there, too.

1513
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,580
On an unstable battlefield like this,

1514
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,780
even a gladiator from the Colosseum would totter and fall!

1515
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,160
Right, Rebecca?

1516
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,760
Vipera Glaive!

1517
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,760
{\an8}Snake Sword

1518
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,740
Don't!
Run, Rebecca! You can't stop that attack!

1519
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,100
Butterfly flowers that divert attacks...

1520
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,260
Mil Fleur!

1521
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,260
{\an8}Thousand Flower

1522
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,840
Moth Orchid!

1523
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,080
Robin-san!

1524
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,140
That's...

1525
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Robiland!

1526
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,260
You've completed your objective, Rebecca.

1527
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,860
Thank you for delivering the key.

1528
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,620
From now on, I'll defend you!
