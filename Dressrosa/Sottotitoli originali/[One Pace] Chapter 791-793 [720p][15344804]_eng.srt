1165
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,100
Oh! He's been saved!

1166
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,020
Lucy!

1167
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,750
Underground Trading
Port Dock

1168
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,650
Look! Nobody's up there now!

1169
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,920
How did it go?!

1170
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,210
What just happened?

1171
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,120
Tell us, Gatz!

1172
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,140
Gatz-san!

1173
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,260
You can't yell anymore!

1174
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,940
Don't push yourself!

1175
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,820
You fools!

1176
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,580
What kind of announcer am I if I can't announce the winner and the loser?

1177
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,300
Look, you two!

1178
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,540
Look to the sky, Dressrosa!

1179
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Which is fading?

1180
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
The bird cage?

1181
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,980
Or Doflamingo's domination?

1182
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
The factory just...

1183
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,480
The bird cage is...

1184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,180
The strings...

1185
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,880
Are gone!

1186
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,870
I can see the sky! The sky!

1187
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,420
The sky!

1188
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,360
I-Is the scenery outside of the cage...

1189
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,840
a town that's been carved into pieces?

1190
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,760
Or is it...

1191
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,920
a land where no one will manipulate us anymore - a land of freedom?

1192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
The bird cage's gone!

1193
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,300
That means...

1194
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,620
The "Great Defense of Dressrosa"!

1195
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,090
The two thousand pirates of the Donquixote Family...

1196
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,240
versus

1197
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,480
the fated warriors, here by coincidence!

1198
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
And the duel between their leaders!

1199
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,580
Royal Warlord of the Sea, Donquixote Doflamingo...

1200
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,850
versus

1201
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,760
the gladiator, Lucy!

1202
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,440
Dah winnah...

1203
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,220
What?

1204
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,240
Dah winnah...

1205
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,290
What's he saying?

1206
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,610
It's "the winner"!

1207
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,680
Dah winnah ish...

1208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,140
You can do it, Gatz-san!

1209
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,770
Dah winnah...

1210
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,850
Stay with us, Gatz!

1211
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,580
Who's there?!

1212
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,280
Don't shout. Don't call for anyone.

1213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,400
I am Donquixote Doflamingo.

1214
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,180
I am the rightful king of this kingdom.

1215
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,790
The king has returned!

1216
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,080
Is it something we did?

1217
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,830
There is no excuse for this.

1218
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,520
The country is done for!

1219
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,820
This was Doflamingo's trap!

1220
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,120
Dah winnah...

1221
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,790
Get a grip already!

1222
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,540
Speak clearly!

1223
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
Listen, Rebecca.

1224
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,060
Don't cry yet.

1225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,070
I won't let the soldier die.

1226
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,440
Make sure you stay safe.

1227
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm gonna beat the crap outta Doflamingo!

1228
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,840
Lucy...

1229
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,330
The winner is...

1230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,780
...Lucy!

1231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,820
Lucy!

1232
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,660
Thank you, Lucy!

1233
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,860
This is the best!

1234
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,010
He did it!

1235
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,920
Super!

1236
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,730
Luffyland!

1237
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,500
Luffy!

1238
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,150
Robiland!

1239
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,440
Luffy!

1240
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,290
He finally did it!

1241
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,910
Well done, my boy!

1242
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,610
Truly incredible!

1243
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,270
Expect nothing less of Luffy-dono!

1244
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,060
Princess!

1245
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm so glad!

1246
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,000
Fraland!

1247
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,020
All of you did great, too!

1248
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,620
You're hurting us!

1249
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,930
We toys were once human!

1250
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,520
Captain!

1251
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,740
They will fight alongside us.

1252
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,710
They are the dwarfs of the Tontatta Kingdom.

1253
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
Are you really sure about leaving her?

1254
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,750
She was crying!

1255
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,440
Even toys have something they want to protect!

1256
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,000
Although these tin eyes of mine cannot shed tears.

1257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,440
That's why the captain has been fighting on his own for ten years.

1258
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,420
What have you done to this country and the king, pirate?!

1259
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,860
The king set the city ablaze.
Didn't you see him?

1260
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,960
His Majesty would never do such a thing!

1261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,620
This battle is to restore the honor of King Riku who was dethroned in shame ten years ago,

1262
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,440
and to regain our freedom!

1263
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,940
Soldier-san!

1264
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,930
I will not let you take...

1265
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,340
another member of my family from me!

1266
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,260
{\an8}A country in ruins needn't necessarily be unhappy.

1267
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,600
{\an8}On this day, amid piles of rubble, the people of this very country...

1268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
{\an8}cried out in joy.

1269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
Hooray!

1270
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
Doflamingo was taken down!

1271
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,990
We're free from now on!

1272
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,820
Mom! Dad!

1273
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,680
Thank God!

1274
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Gatz-san!

1275
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah, he did it!

1276
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,550
So aren't you gonna finish me off?

1277
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,640
Don't need to.

1278
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,780
Seems like it's all over.

1279
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,680
You brothers are too soft!

1280
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,620
After losing to our captain at Banaro Island,

1281
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,040
Ace had something to say
before he was handed over to the Navy.

1282
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
Wanna hear it?

1283
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,250
Underground Port

1284
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,200
Hey, hurry up!
The duel between Straw Hat and Doflamingo is over!

1285
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,370
The Navy'll be here soon!

1286
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,620
We know!

1287
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,470
You call the chief yet?

1288
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,960
We're trying!

1289
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,660
He's not picking up.

1290
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,860
He only answers when he feels like it.

1291
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,120
You'll get a kick outta hearin' it!

1292
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,500
He realized he was gonna be executed, so he said...

1293
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,180
Don't tell my brother.

1294
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,240
Man, what an idiot!

1295
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,420
He had no idea how much he was worth!

1296
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,830
If Fire Fist Ace was captured by the Navy,
the news would spread all over the world!

1297
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,800
The Navy would make 120% use of his pathetic life-

1298
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,680
That's quite enough.

1299
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,580
Stop talking.

1300
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,380
How he felt when he passed away...

1301
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,180
Fire Fist Ace Dies

1302
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,460
I've thought about it non-stop
since that day, every single night.

1303
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,790
You don't have to tell me. I fully understand!

1304
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,060
Then let it sink in, fool!

1305
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,850
As for that Devil Fruit you have...

1306
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,200
If I can't steal it here, it'll damage
my reputation as a hunter of Devil Fruit users.

1307
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,900
You're not getting away from me, Flame Fruit!

1308
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,260
You're regretting it, aren't you?!

1309
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,340
Even though you had the title and the power,

1310
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,220
you still didn't try to save your brother!

1311
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,620
You weren't there at all, were you?!

1312
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,260
Were you taking a nap or something?

1313
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,390
You weren't there when he needed you most.

1314
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,320
And you call yourselves brothers!

1315
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm done regretting it!

1316
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Fire Fist!

1317
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,540
Dammit!

1318
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,550
I've made peace with it,
but Ace is saying he can't forgive you.

1319
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,150
Oh! Hello, Sabo-kun?

1320
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,140
Where in the world are you?!

1321
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,750
I saw Burgess going after Luffy-kun earlier,

1322
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,020
so I frantically tried to contact you, but you weren't answering at all!

1323
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,290
That so? I wasn't paying attention.

1324
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,190
You weren't what?!

1325
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,420
Don't worry, I took care of it already.

1326
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,030
That aside, Koala, have you found the list?

1327
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,590
For crying out... Yes, I found it!

1328
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,270
Then just call the ship and-

1329
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,260
I called it!

1330
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,830
Well, let's meet up with Hack underground then.

1331
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm with Hack and everyone else underground!

1332
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,830
Why did he hang up?! That selfish jerk!

1333
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,160
Stop taking it out on me, Koala-san!

1334
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,380
There he is!

1335
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,530
The Donquixote Family!

1336
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,960
Their eight commanders and...

1337
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,180
...three top commanders are all accounted for!

1338
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,530
Watch out!

1339
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,060
Most of the commanders are Devil Fruit users!

1340
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,680
Secure them with Sea Stone!

1341
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,580
Yes, sir!

1342
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,060
Just stay here with me.

1343
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,400
Yes.

1344
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,060
Whoa! Wh-What're you doing?!

1345
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,370
You said, "Stay here with me"!

1346
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,380
So we'll be together forever!

1347
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,380
Get off of me!

1348
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,360
Have we contacted Navy HQ yet?

1349
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,420
Well, actually...

1350
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,340
Isshou-san said, "Don't file a report yet."

1351
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Vice Admiral Maynard!
The Surveillance Snail is ready!

1352
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,280
Alright, I'll do the talking.

1353
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,530
Take another Surveillance Snail
and follow Isshou-san, per orders!

1354
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes, sir!

1355
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,790
Applenine - A Neighboring Country

1356
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,780
{\an8}This is Applenine Island, a country near Dressrosa.

1357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,820
What the heck?

1358
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
What's wrong?

1359
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,860
I heard there'll be a broadcast from Dressrosa!

1360
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,740
Will it be a speech from King Doflamingo?

1361
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
Scary, isn't it?

1362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,640
This is Dressrosa...

1363
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,020
Another Neighboring Country

1364
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,200
We are broadcasting to the three neighboring island countries within range of the Surveillance Snail.

1365
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,180
Yet Another Neighboring Country

1366
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,850
I am Navy HQ Vice Admiral Maynard!

1367
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,820
The Navy?

1368
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,020
This is Dressrosa.

1369
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,800
We are broadcasting to the three neighboring island countries within range of the Surveillance Snail.

1370
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,870
But why?

1371
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,600
I want you to take a look at these images!

1372
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,700
What's up with the piles of rubble?

1373
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,280
What you're seeing is
the current state of Dressrosa!

1374
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
What does he mean?

1375
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,450
I ask you to keep calm as I tell you...

1376
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:32,960
all the details of what the Warlord,
Donquixote Doflamingo, did today in this very country!

1377
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,060
Isshou-san, I'll do as you asked.

1378
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,810
We're begging you, Your Majesty!

1379
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,980
So many of us citizens were turned into toys and couldn't speak out!

1380
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,800
No! Please... stop this.

1381
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,560
Even if the misunderstanding about me has cleared up,
I cannot return as your king.

1382
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,300
No! You are this country's true king!

1383
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,510
That's right!

1384
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,540
We're sick and tired of violence!

1385
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,580
Your Majesty!

1386
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,780
What if everyone in the kingdom shared your values?

1387
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
Wait.

1388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,060
The Riku Family's position falls apart when faced with turmoil.

1389
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,280
This event has proven that.

1390
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,860
We don't care if we fall to ruin!

1391
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,260
We'd gladly fall to ruin if there were
any hope for peace together with you!

1392
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,110
We want you to renounce war, as our pacifist king!

1393
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,310
That's right!

1394
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,180
Even if it causes our country to fall, we're fine with that!

1395
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,600
We don't mind being poor!
Just make Dressrosa a peaceful country again!

1396
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,010
Your Majesty!

1397
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,220
Your Majesty, we're begging you!

1398
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,260
As a fighting king, their words grate my ears!

1399
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Elizabello!

1400
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,340
Your Majesty! You must return to the palace at once!

1401
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,400
Kings from neighboring countries keep calling us!

1402
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,000
What did you say?

1403
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,910
I had to tell them right away...

1404
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,540
that King Riku is coming back.
They were all overjoyed to hear that!

1405
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
The King of Prodence!

1406
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,120
It's barely been a decade.
How could you age so much?

1407
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,840
Where is the man who would stare down the world to avoid a war?

1408
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,580
Your people are waiting for you.

1409
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,160
Come home...

1410
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Miracle King, Riku Dold!

1411
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,680
He is right, King Riku!

1412
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,250
All this trouble that Doflamingo caused...

1413
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,080
I would rather you not take responsibility for it.

1414
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,740
That vicious pirate was approved as king of a country
under the Seven Warlords system,

1415
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,780
and thus permitted to reign over this island by none other than...

1416
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,460
the World Government!

1417
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,160
To all who inhabit this country...

1418
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,320
and to all members of its royal family...

1419
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,540
On behalf of the Government,

1420
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,560
I most humbly apologize!

1421
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,580
We most deeply regret what has been done!

1422
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
What are you...

1423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,600
The Navy admiral has prostrated himself?

1424
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,960
You're kidding me...

1425
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,840
The Government controls the Navy!

1426
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,480
And one of the Navy admirals,
the greatest of their military might...

1427
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,970
is bowing before King Riku and his nation in apology!

1428
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,310
What the heck is going on in Dressrosa?

1429
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,290
Law - Straw Hat Pirate Alliance

1430
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,400
That pirate alliance took down
the Celestial Yaksha, Doflamingo?

1431
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,540
Take pictures! Put them in print already!

1432
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,600
This is completely unheard of!

1433
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,880
{\an8}The false glory of the mighty country, Dressrosa, and the truth behind it.

1434
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,060
{\an8}The downfall of the world's greatest
underground broker, Doflamingo.

1435
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,100
{\an8}And the prostration of Navy HQ Admiral Fujitora.

1436
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
{\an8}The major incidents that were confined within the cage...

1437
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,860
{\an8}have just been released to the entire world.

1438
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,670
An admiral from
Navy HQ has prostrated himself?!

1439
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,880
The Surveillance Snail is running, too!

1440
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,780
Th-That's a Navy admiral, isn't it?

1441
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,590
Wh-What happened?

1442
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,880
Something's going on in Dressrosa!

1443
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,500
Raise your head, Fujitora.

1444
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,460
Fujitora, aren't you worried about the world seeing this?

1445
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,720
You couldn't possibly...

1446
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,180
Could it be...

1447
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,500
that you stayed away from Doflamingo so you could enact this?

1448
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,970
Fujitora!

1449
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,640
The world must know the truth!

1450
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,860
I left all the fighting to them.
I made a wager on them.

1451
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,020
We are the ones who allowed the Warlords to do as they please.

1452
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,640
So who are we to point our swords at them,

1453
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,780
and yet preach about justice without bearing shame?

1454
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:08,520
This country earned its victory at the hands of pirates, warriors, and its citizens!

1455
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,280
Our long, hard battle is at last over.

1456
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,920
I am truly...

1457
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,660
I am truly grateful for your hard work.

1458
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,660
Little Army of King Riku, Special Anti-Doflamingo Forces!

1459
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,140
Yes, Commander!

1460
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,740
As of today, you are all...

1461
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,760
...dismissed!

1462
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,600
Commander!

1463
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,940
Tank!

1464
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,940
The Navy still has their position to consider.

1465
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,860
Hide the pirates and warriors
who fought for us in the palace.

1466
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,980
Take those without shelter there as well.
I hate to ask, but can I count on you?

1467
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,440
Of course, it would be my pleasure, Your Majesty!

1468
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:12,150
The Red Line

1469
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,310
Holy Land, Mariejois

1470
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,800
So...

1471
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,140
Reporting Doflamingo's resignation, and then revealing it as false...

1472
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,100
Was this all by order of those people above you?

1473
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:30,160
World Government Supreme Authority
The Five Elder Stars

1474
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,870
Navy Headquarters Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki (Akainu)

1475
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,160
Why should the world be deceived

1476
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,740
for the sake of someone like Doflamingo?!

1477
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,400
If something like this ever happens again,
it'll bring shame on me as fleet admiral!

1478
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,080
Don't ever do that again, under any circumstances!

1479
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,270
Don't give us any of your cheek, Sakazuki.

1480
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,040
Your honor is completely inconsequential.

1481
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,540
The Navy is merely the public face of the Government.

1482
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,520
We left this case entirely up to Cipher Pol.

1483
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,100
Hmph! Cipher Pol, huh?

1484
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,020
So simply put,

1485
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,640
they've gone over your heads.

1486
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,190
Those damn puppets of the Celestial Dragons!

1487
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,340
Watch your mouth, Sakazuki!

1488
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,460
And what of Kuzan's actions?

1489
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,880
I can hardly believe a powerful man like him
sides with Blackbeard now.

1490
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,660
That is sure to bring dishonor to the Navy!

1491
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,280
That idiot resigned from the Navy!

1492
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,420
Where he is and what he's doing is not our responsibility!

1493
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,000
Five Elder Stars! Fleet Admiral Sakazuki!

1494
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,900
Reporting in!

1495
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:52,000
The Warlord, Donquixote Doflamingo, and his family
were defeated by the Law - Straw Hat Pirate Alliance.

1496
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,940
And Dressrosa has been destroyed.
There's nothing left of it!

1497
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
What'd you say?!

1498
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
Again...

1499
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,800
...with that brat?

1500
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,460
And there's one more thing...

1501
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,620
Countries Across the New World

1502
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,980
{\an8}The video and story that were sent to Dressrosa's neighbors spread from one island to the next.

1503
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,200
Extra! Extra!

1504
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,510
{\an8}The news spread like wildfire
throughout the world, with dire repercussions.

1505
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,430
Doflamingo Falls!!

1506
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,720
Joker was defeated!

1507
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,000
Your Majesty!
We have no other way to acquire weapons!

1508
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,480
Announce our surrender.

1509
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,780
The war is over!

1510
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,480
We've already paid! We had a deal!

1511
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,280
That bastard, Joker!

1512
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,190
I know they still have weapons in Dressrosa!

1513
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,730
Don't! There's still a Navy admiral over there!

1514
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,190
Our deal for the Devil Fruits!

1515
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,890
What'll happen to the Smiles deal now?!

1516
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,960
If only these fools weren't there!

1517
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,570
Come now, Tsuru-chan!
You didn't need to tag along with us!

1518
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,120
I ought to be saying that, Inspector General!

1519
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,680
Well, they're the pirate group that you've been chasing after all this time, aren't they?

1520
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,240
Yes, under your orders.

1521
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,320
Want some rice crackers?

1522
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,300
In a Certain Town

1523
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,320
How's this? This is today's special mixed pizza.

1524
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,250
Huh? Thief!

1525
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,950
Hey, old lady! Stop!

1526
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,980
Crap, where did she go?

1527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,510
Tsk, just a little girl. Old lady, where'd you go?!

1528
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,900
Oh, they took down Doflamingo.

1529
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,520
Not bad.
Makes me happy to be from the same generation.

1530
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,370
From South Blue - Captain of the Bonney Pirates
"The Glutton" Jewelry Bonney

1531
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,600
In a certain sky

1532
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,300
High Priest Urouge!

1533
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,480
High Priest Urouge!

1534
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,980
Th-There's somebody here! High Priest!

1535
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,500
From the Sky Islands - Captain of the Fallen Monk Pirates
"Mad Monk" Urouge

1536
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,450
Nonsense! We're on a Sky Island.

1537
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,300
It's an abandoned and isolated cloud island, at that.

1538
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,220
Nobody but us could possibly-

1539
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:56,170
In a certain sea

1540
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,200
Whoa, whoa, not bad, that pirate alliance.

1541
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,080
Looks like my fellow pirates ain't doing too shabby.

1542
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:03,470
From West Blue - Captain of the Fire Tank Pirates
Capone "Gang" Bege

1543
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,760
Capture Caesar at any cost, boys!

1544
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,580
Yes, Father!

1545
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,310
The Kid Pirates' Hideout

1546
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,360
They made their move before we knew it.

1547
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,790
It's a huge victory!

1548
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,890
Doflamingo is connected to Kaidou behind the scenes, for sure.

1549
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,160
Well, that's gonna make Kaidou pretty mad, yeah?

1550
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,120
From South Blue - Captain of the Kid Pirates
Eustass "Captain" Kid

1551
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,700
If they planned this, their target must be...

1552
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,370
From North Blue - Captain of the Hawkins Pirates
"The Mage" Basil Hawkins

1553
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,720
...one of the Four Emperors, as we thought.

1554
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,750
From the Grand Line (Longarm Tribe) - Captain of the On-Air Pirates
"Roaring Tide" Scratchmen Apoo

1555
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,900
"Beast King" Kaidou, eh?

1556
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,300
From South Blue - Kid Pirates Combatant
"Soldier of Slaughter" Killer

1557
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,860
Good thing our target isn't theirs.

1558
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,320
We won't have to fight each other
and waste our military might.

1559
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,620
Our target is one of the other Four Emperors,
"Red Hair" Shanks!

1560
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,890
{\an8}And now we shift attention to Drake,
who once provoked a battle in Kaidou's territory...

1561
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,900
A Certain Island

1562
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,420
Your father was killed? By Doflamingo?

1563
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,900
That was a long time ago. I bear no grudge.

1564
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:10,870
From North Blue - Captain of the Drake Pirates
"Red Flag" X-Drake

1565
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,620
What gives? That's pretty heartless of you.

1566
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,140
Hey, give us a hand here!

1567
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,720
This is an emergency!
If we don't let him know right away, he'll snap!

1568
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,550
Kaidou-sama! Where are you?

1569
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,360
That idiot Joker screwed up big time!

1570
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,000
We won't be receiving Smiles anymore!

1571
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,380
Don't play dumb with me, Isshou!

1572
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,690
Dressrosa

1573
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,240
You know full well the gravity of
a Navy admiral admitting to oversight!

1574
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Why didn't you report to HQ first?!

1575
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,820
Had I reported in, surely you would have changed
the details of the report yet again, would you not?

1576
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,560
What did you just say?!

1577
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,600
I also feel the Seven Warlord system must end.

1578
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:10,440
Two years ago, I was there when Crocodile showed his true nature.

1579
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,280
The Navy couldn't do anything!

1580
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,630
If it weren't for the Straw Hats,

1581
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,560
Alabasta would be another country
governed by a pirate, just like Dressrosa.

1582
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,580
Yet the Government reported that it was the Navy's doing!

1583
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,620
If only I held higher rank then!

1584
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,480
I can't believe Fujitora really did it.

1585
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,500
It reminds me of the frustration I felt
at Alabasta Kingdom two years ago.

1586
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,560
The Straw Hats' triumph was covered up then.

1587
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,980
It's like he paid them back for us.

1588
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,440
Even if I held the same rank as him,
I couldn't have pulled that off.

1589
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,560
I could feast on this feeling for days.

1590
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,100
Oh, we have muffins! How about some coffee?

1591
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,930
That didn't mean I wanted to eat, you idiot!

1592
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,290
Hey lady, I'm hungry!

1593
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,620
We're hungry too!

1594
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,480
We have muffins! How about some coffee?

1595
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,800
You can't give kids coffee!

1596
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,230
I want a muffin!

1597
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,900
Are we at Megapants' yet?

1598
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,060
That's "Vegapunk".

1599
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,220
It'll be a few more days until we reach Dr. Vegapunk's lab.

1600
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,180
How lovely!
Captain-chan's sweet to the kids!

1601
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,970
I wish I were a kid!

1602
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,110
Hey, you bunch!
There's still tons of work to do!

1603
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,290
Aye aye, ma'am!

1604
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,420
Scold me more, Captain-chan!

1605
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,740
Cover-ups happen all the time!

1606
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,240
I would rather not be a hero forged upon lies.

1607
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:24,930
It was our employer, the World Government,
that hired pirates to maintain balance in the world.

1608
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,420
This is a matter of the Navy's credibility and dignity!

1609
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,380
I-Isshou-san, y-you're talking to...

1610
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,380
Your selfish actions dishonor the very name of justice!

1611
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,960
If you value your justice so damn much,
then keep a close eye on it!

1612
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,640
If we lose credibility just for admitting fault,
we haven't any in the first place!

1613
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,560
Then you clean up after yourself, Fujitora!

1614
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,600
Straw Hat and Law... Until you bring me their heads,

1615
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,180
you are hereby barred from setting foot within any Navy base in the world!

1616
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Good, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1617
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,340
Meat...

1618
