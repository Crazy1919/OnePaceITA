Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,650
Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

There's power hidden in the bond between us,

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

Bellamy.

48
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,620
Why did you cheer me on?

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,990
That was so embarrassing.

50
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,700
I haven't changed a bit.

51
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,600
You've changed, Bellamy.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,340
No, you have changed.

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,680
You can now use Haki far greater than anyone can imagine.

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,740

55
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,080
My pride has been broken to pieces!

61
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,340
I thought a Fighting Fish would be a fish.

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,960
Isn't it a fish?

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,830
You can't call that a fish! It's no different from a sea monster!

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,510
It's a beast!

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,440
The guy said they reinforced the bridge

66
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,800
with iron to protect it from them!

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,040
I-It's going to be alright, isn't it?!

68
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,860
This bridge is a piece of crap!

69
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,990
We're gonna be okay.

70
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,050
These guys can take care of them.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,490
You handle it, Warlord!

72
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,500
Nah, I can't fight right now.

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,640
Here they come!

74
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,430

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,160
Green St-

76
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,260
Another one from the opposite side!

77
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,380
They're gonna crush us!

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,350

Skull Exploding Grass!

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,140
You're doing great!

85
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,170
No, we're not! Can't you see how many there are?!

86
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,670
It's a whole school!

87
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,970
Let's just run! It'll take forever to fight them all!

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,180
Nose-ya, uncuff Caesar! I want him to fight too!

89
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,050
What are you talking about?! He'll just fly away!

90
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,620
He wouldn't dare make a move like that.

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,060
My heart!

92
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,110
You won't die a peaceful death...

93
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,190
after pushing around a genius scientist like me!

94
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,260
Gastille!

95
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,970
Wow! He's really powerful!

96
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,980
As expected from a criminal with a 300 million belly bounty!

97
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,710
Gastille!

98
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,340
Run through!

99
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,640
Like I said, why aren't you fighting?!

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,190
It takes a lot of energy to use my ability.

101
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,900
And I have to be at my best on our way back!

102
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,830
Do you understand?!

103
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,800
I need to keep my strength up as much as possible!

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,380
Because our enemy is Doflamingo!

105
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,940
Law... Is he really going to fight against Joker?!

106
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,980
Oh no! What should we do?!

107
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,580
The bridge has collapsed.

108
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,150
On top of that, I can't see the other side clearly because of the fog!

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,060
A Fighting Fish is coming from the front!

110
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,040
Damn! I can't let it destroy any more of the bridge!

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,330
Roo...

112
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
It stopped.

113
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,730
We caught it!

114
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,640
Alright, let's pull it in!

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,030
We had a decisive battle today!

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,660
Let's eat Fighting Fish stew to boost our energy!

117
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,030
Yeah!

118
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,770
Whose voice is that?

119
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,570
Residents of the island?

120
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,550
I thought it was a deserted island.

121
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,560
Hey! Who is over there on the other side?!

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
We want to cross the bridge!

123
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh no! It's a human!

124
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,130
Hurry up! Run!

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,280
Law, you bastard! I'll get even with you, I mean it!

126
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,960
Wow, what a view! What a lovely view!

127
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,130
We should have thought of flying from the beginning.

128
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,830
Oh, you're right!

129
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,570
Cut that crap!

130
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,840
How much gas energy do you think you need to fly 3 people?!

131
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm an important hostage for you!

132
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,770
The drag marks from the fish end there.

133
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,240
Nobody is here yet.

134
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,080
These waters are filled with ships that were sunk by Fighting Fish attacks.

135
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,780
What was that just now?

136
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,290
What's that?!

137
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,800
Uninhabited Forest North of Dressrosa
"Green Bit"

138
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,800
{\an8}A wild forest?!

139
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,870
S-So this is...

140
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,740
Green Bit?

141
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,610
What are those giant plants?!

142
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Hey, Joker, it's me! Come get me!

143
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,420
Don't be in such a rush.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,540
Over there is the arranged drop point, the southeast beach.

145
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,360
We will leave you there at 3 in the afternoon.

146
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,820
Look at the beach on the other side!

147
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,520
Isn't that a Marine warship?!

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,850
It got stuck on the island! It's not just beached!

149
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,960
How is that possible?

150
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,250
Those cuts on the plants look fresh.

151
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,130
What?

152
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,120
It seems that ship hasn't been here for too long.

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,110
Its body is not as damaged as it should be.

154
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,930
Did they make it through the water filled with the Fighting Fish?

155
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,570
It's only a matter of time before the Navy gets here.

156
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,010
What?! Do they know about the trade?!

157
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,740
I didn't know that!

158
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,960
You stupid scientist, you're too loud!

159
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,690
Hey, I'm a wanted person!

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,150
Since my boss, Joker, resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea,

161
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm not protected under any laws!

162
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,710
If you leave me handcuffed on the island where the Navy is wandering, I'll...

163
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,720
I said "Shh! Be quiet!"

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,870
Wait a minute! Joker is just a pirate now too!

165
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,310
You look like you're hiding something.

166
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,630
It's just a coincidence.

167
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,610
How could I manipulate the Navy?

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,110
I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.

169
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,920
It's not proper to hand me over here! Abort this mission!

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,460
The Navy is my enemy as well
since I'm allied with the Straw Hats.

171
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,880
Don't tell me you set me up!

172
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,400
They'll be here in 15 minutes.

173
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:27,040
You all need to take up sniping and recon positions and cover me.

174
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,870
They may be hiding. Go check the forest.

175
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,350
If you find something, let me know as soon as possible.

176
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,880
Okay, got it.

177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,530
Wait a minute!

178
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,580
We didn't expect the Navy to be here so...

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,530
Time Remaining Until the Exchange: 14 Minutes
Green Bit Forest

180
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,600
R-Robin!

181
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,010
This forest is dangerous! Wait!

182
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,740
Let's not get separated!

183
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,780
Thank you for being so manly, Usopp.

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,650
You're too loud!

185
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,910
Please don't leave me!

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,080
Can you walk a little slower?

187
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,250
Ouch! Don't stop so suddenly, Robin...

188
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,670
Who is it?! The Straw Hats?!

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,530
We've been found!

190
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,340
Where?! Where are they?!

191
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,520
You're wrong! I'm Leo!

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,740
It's the Navy. Who are they talking to?

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,610
Looks like they knew we were coming to this island.

194
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,290
Are you good people or bad people?!

195
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,130
We're the Navy! We protect the citizens.

196
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,010
We're definitely good people!

197
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,820
Then hand over your weapons!

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,670
We won't give you our weapons! We have a mission!

199
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,720
Show yourself!

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
Huh?! What's going on?!

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,540
I can't see. It's too fast.

202
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,110
What is with this forest?!

203
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,090
Damn it!

204
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,350
We've been stripped of everything!

205
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,810
Mille Fleur...

206
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,810
{\an8}One Million Flowers

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,690
Campo de Flores!

208
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,690
{\an8}Flower Field

209
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,290
I caught one!

210
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,960
Huh?! What did you catch?!

211
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,550
It looks like a dwarf!

212
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,850
What?!

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,670
What's in her bag?

214
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,590
A book, a notebook, and some clothes.

215
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,800
A candy.

216
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,370
A Snail Phone.

217
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,250
Make sure to take all of her weapons.

218
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,210
There's something suspicious under her clothes!

219
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,630
We are searching her clothes!

220
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,430
No abnormalities at Point C.

221
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,220
Roger.

222
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,610
No abnormalities at Point A.

223
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,990
Roger.

224
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,330
She's not hiding anything around Point B either.

225
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,180
The Big Human has woken up!

226
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
Go on the alert!

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
Okay!

228
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,920
Ow!

229
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,350
Don't try to run! Stay calm!

230
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,970
My body is sewn to the ground!

231
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,930
It's no use trying to move!

232
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,000
With my magic Stitch power,

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
I've sewn you to the ground.

234
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,930
Stitch power?

235
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,390
That's right! I sewed you up with this needle!

236
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,340
You're a villainous Big Human, aren't you?

237
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm sorry, but I think there's been a misunderstanding.

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,210
Are you a devil fruit user?

239
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,720
{\an8}I'm a Tontatta Tribe warrior, Leo!

240
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,720
Tontatta Tribe Member (Dwarf)
Warrior Leo

241
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,490
Leo-san. Where am I?

242
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,620
Where is Usopp?

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,790
I mean, the other human, where is he?

244
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,010
Is he okay?

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,530
The long-nosed Big Human was also captured in accordance with our kingdom's rules.

246
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,740
So this place is the country of dwarves, isn't it?

247
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,530
Indeed, this is what our tribe has raised, underneath the great forest, the Tontatta Kingdom.

248
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,740
The forest? You mean Green Bit?

249
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,690
Did you people grow all those giant plants?!

250
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,860
Yes! There is no plant that we can't grow!

251
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,820
Watch out, everybody!

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,780
Kabu-san!

253
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,360
This Big Human can sprout flower-like hands on the ground!

254
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,750
Flower-like hands?!

255
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,270
We've never grown such things!

256
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes, it must be magic! The strangest thing I've ever seen!

257
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,870
There was no time to run before she caught me!

258
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,850
Are you the one who stripped the Navy soldiers of their things?

259
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,470
I got hypnotized by something and they must've carried me here.

260
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,930
I could probably get away from here with my power, but it would only make matters worse.

261
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,640
Big Human! What is your objective?!

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,970
Are you here to destroy the Tontatta Kingdom?!

263
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,840
No! I'm sorry! I just caught him out of curiosity.

264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,020
Whatever the reason is,

265
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,680
we can't let anybody who has seen our Tontatta Tribe live.

266
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,640
No way! I wasn't going to hurt any of your people.

267
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,540
And I'll never tell anyone that I saw you!

268
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,520
Don't lie!

269
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
I don't wanna hear your excuses!

270
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,470
I mean it!

271
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,480
What?

272
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,380
In that case, it's okay!

273
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,270
What?!

274
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,390
Oh, what a relief!

275
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,050
I thought she was a bad person.

276
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,870
Great!

277
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,980
They believed me!

278
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,460
They're so trusting...

279
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,220
You're free now!

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,640
Here, these are your glasses.

281
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Thank you.

282
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,930
Hey, Leo!

283
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,160
Tonta-chief-sama!

284
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,470
Just what are you doing?

285
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,540
Tonta-chief-sama, she is a good person!

286
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,000
No way!

287
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,620
But she said so herself.

288
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,330
What?!

289
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,720
Okay then.

290
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,280
He also believed it?!
Why are everyone here so trusting?!

291
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,680
Well well, we don't often have a chance to stare at a Big Human like this.

292
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,430
Who are you?

293
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:51,390
{\an8}My name is Gancho, the greatest Tonta-chief of Tontatta Kingdom.

294
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,790
Tontatta Tribe Tonta-chief (King)
 Gancho

295
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,790
{\an8}You can stay as long as you like.

296
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,790
Where is my Transponder Snail?

297
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,430
Oh!

298
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,770
I released it into the wild!

299
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,800
Oh no! It's almost three!

300
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,010
I have to call Law!

301
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,630
Where is the exit?

302
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,570
I must go!

303
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,650
Wait! Are you leaving?

304
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,080
You're a good person, aren't you?

305
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,830
If you're a good person, give us a weapon!

306
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,980
That's the rule!

307
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,520
If you don't give us one, we're gonna strip you of all you have!

308
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,360
But I don't have any weapons!

309
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,060
Then we have no choice.

310
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,410
We're gonna strip you of all you have!

311
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,520
Take everything she has!

312
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,710
No! Wait a minute!

313
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,850
What's the matter?

314
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,150
That Big Human is...

315
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,090
the hero's partner!

316
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,690
What?!

317
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,660
T-The hero?!

318
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,820
Usopp?

319
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,620
Who is this hero that you're talking about?

320
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm talking about the other Big Human that we captured earlier.

321
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,580
He has appeared for our sake!

322
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,880
He's the legendary... legendary...

323
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,510
He's the legendary hero!

324
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,110
That's good!

325
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,400
Awesome!

326
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,160
I wanna see him!

327
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,070
Usopp... What kind of lie...?

328
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,590
Dressrosa
Harbor City Acacia

329
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,590
{\an8}Turn right! I said "Right"!

330
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,760
Why did you turn left?!

331
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,590
Shut up! Be quiet! You're distracting me!

332
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,430
Mom, he's talking to himself...

333
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't look him in the eye!

334
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm in hurry!

335
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,750
Not as much as I am!

336
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,510
If I don't make it, it'll be your fault!

337
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,210
Get to the Flower Field!

338
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,850
All right! Just shut up!

339
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,980
Ow, ow, ow... This is no good!

340
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,370
I'm such a klutz! This human will see me!

341
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,190
I have to run! Otherwise, the human will...

342
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,670
I'm such a klutz!

343
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,040
A klutz and stupid and a fool!

344
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,340
I always knew I'd fail like this!

345
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,910
This is the true identity of fairies.

346
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,640
A toy?

347
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,950
{\an8}I'm not a toy!

348
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,070
Tontatta Tribe Member (Dwarf)
 Scouting Unit: Wicca

349
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,510
{\an8}I'm Wicca from the Tontatta Tribe!

350
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,610
{\an8}Please don't tell anybody that you saw me!

351
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,620
What now?!

352
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,870
I can't walk! I think I twisted my ankle earlier!

353
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm such a klutz, klutz, klutz!

354
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,240
What's with that power? You're smashing the ground.

355
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,210
Please!

356
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,220
Take me to my commander!

357
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,920
When you come right down to it, it's kind of your fault.

358
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,180
You stole my sword!

359
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,730
We manage the greenery of this land!

360
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:14,190
The Big Humans of this kingdom call us "fairies" and give us things!

361
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,540
I have to go! I'm a member of a scouting unit!

362
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,300
I have to report the Donquixote Family's whereabouts to my commander!

363
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,510
Now is our chance!

364
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,570
I saw the Donquixote Family on their way to attack the Straw Hats' ship!

365
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,640
What?!

366
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm such a klutz! I told him everything!

367
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,890
Hey, is that true?! I'm a member of the Straw Hats!

368
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,890
Klutz! I'm such a klutz! Klutz!

369
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,590
Stop destroying the town!

370
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,770
Calm down, fairy!

371
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,900
Is it true that the Donquixote Family is going to attack the Sunny?!

372
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,550
It's a secret! But I saw it!

373
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,310
Oh, I did it again!

374
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,220
I don't have a Transponder Snail.

375
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,550
There's no way to tell them about it.

376
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,700
Of all the crew,

377
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,800
I can't believe they're attacking those four.

378
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,560
Alright, I'm gonna head back to the Sunny!

379
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,260
Wait!

380
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,150
Take me to the Flower Field first!

381
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,520
I'll guide you to the sea right after that!

382
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,130
No, I'm gonna head to the sea now!

383
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,300
But...

384
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,320
you're running in the opposite direction!

385
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,710
You don't know which way to go, do you?!

386
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,680
So you're saying...

387
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,990
Doflamingo's people were following our movements.

388
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,430
Yes. That is what we had observed.

389
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,450
Do you guys have some kind of a connection with Doflamingo too?

390
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,290
Yes! Oops!

391
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,100
That is a secret.

392
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,280
Damn it! Not only is the ship in danger, but the rest of us as well!

393
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,400
Hey, are we there yet? The Flower Field?!

394
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,140
Go up the stairs there!

395
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I said "Go up"!

396
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,460
Are you a f-fool?

397
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,430
Shut up!

398
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,450
Dressrosa
Corrida Colosseum

399
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,530
Wait! Monkey-san!

400
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,610
I got you!

401
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,120
Like I said! What kind of place is the Flower Field?!

402
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,850
Be quiet and keep running. I'll fill you in later.

403
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,100
Don't let the police see you!

404
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,540
Aren't you a soldier?!

405
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Soldier-san!

406
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,060
Rebecca.

407
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
I saw the list in the Colosseum.

408
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,880
I figured you would enter the competition.

409
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,520
I told you not to!

410
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,760
I...

411
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,180
I'll do it! I'll win it!

412
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,680
Soldier-san!

413
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,450
So...

414
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,650
And then... let's live together!

415
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,560
A warrior who cries so easily cannot win a competition!

416
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,570
Hey, hurry up and go!

417
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,430
Huh? You sure?

418
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,270
It's fine.

419
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Quickly, now!

420
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,740
Is it really okay?! That girl was crying!

421
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,890
That's why we must hurry!

422
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,670
I'm just a toy, but I have something that I want to protect!

423
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,500
Though I can't shed tears from these tin eyes.

424
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,640
Green Bit
Southeast Beach

425
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,360
The appointed time for Caesar's hand-over...

426
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,960
is in two minutes.

427
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,400
Hey, Law! This is Sanji!

428
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,890
Black Foot-ya huh? Did you find the factory?

429
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,490
That's not important now!

430
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,890
Listen carefully!

431
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,810
You've got to get out of there!

432
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,070
What are you talking about?

433
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,340
I have to hand Caesar over soon!

434
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,840
Doflamingo never resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

435
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,280
Even if you give Caesar back to him, the deal is off!

436
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,500
We've been...

437
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,160
totally deceived!

438
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
I don't understand...

439
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,350
How...

440
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,040
You have to get off the island, now!

441
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,590
The news about Doflamingo was wrong?

442
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,120
What do you mean by that, Saka-san?

443
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,960
Are you saying the Navy Headquarters were fooled by a false report?

444
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Yea, it's really aggravating.

445
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,220
I'm going to go talk to the Five Elders at Mariejois.

446
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,300
I'm sorry, but that's how it is.

447
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,280
I need you to keep going ahead to
Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo's meeting point.

448
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,020
Roger that.

449
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,850
All units! To the southeastern beach!

450
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,350
Hurry up!

451
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,860
You fool. It's too late.
