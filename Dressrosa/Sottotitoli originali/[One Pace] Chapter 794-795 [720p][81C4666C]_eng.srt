00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,820
Kyros' House

1165
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,250
So you met him while with the Revolutionary Army?

1166
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,860
Yes.

1167
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,170
Luffy...

1168
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,700
Robin, you don't have to wake him.

1169
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,920
I just came to see his face before I set off.

1170
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,790
Are you leaving the country already?

1171
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,750
Yeah. Trouble's headed this way.

1172
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,080
What kind of trouble?

1173
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,260
CP-0.

1174
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,820
They played a part in Doflamingo's deception scheme.

1175
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,800
And they're targeting us.

1176
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,560
Dressrosa's gonna get busy in a day or two.

1177
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,360
You guys should also leave as soon as possible.

1178
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,140
Thank you for telling us.

1179
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,680
And what's more, I didn't know he had another brother besides Ace.

1180
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,370
For real, this is the first I've heard of it.

1181
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,480
I bet.

1182
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,760
I think it surprised Luffy the most.

1183
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,500
What do you mean by that?

1184
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,060
I was presumed dead for a long time.

1185
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,900
I was always with Luffy and Ace when I was a kid.

1186
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,780
Running around with wild abandon,
being disciplined by that old man, Garp,

1187
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,080
dreaming about becoming pirates...

1188
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,300
And we exchanged cups of sake and became brothers.

1189
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,100
But one day, I was involved in an accident.

1190
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,470
Uh, well, an incident.

1191
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,520
Ace! Luffy!

1192
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,600
There's something wrong with this town! They're all mad!

1193
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,630
They all know people are going to die, but they're acting like nothing's wrong. They're even smiling!

1194
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,810
I don't want to be in this town!

1195
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,660
I have to tell them as soon as possible!

1196
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,740
Ace! Luffy! Run!

1197
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,840
What happened to you, young boy?

1198
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,030
This town smells worse than the Gray Terminal!

1199
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,410
It's the disgusting stench of rotten people!

1200
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,160
I'll never be free if I stay here!

1201
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,160
Ace... Luffy...

1202
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,220
I really want to see you...

1203
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,880
This place is like a bird cage...

1204
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not sure if I can bear living in
this kingdom, breathing this stale air.

1205
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,900
Just what... is freedom?

1206
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,520
Where can I find it?

1207
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,600
Ace... Luffy...

1208
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,210
Somebody... help me...

1209
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,320
Help...

1210
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,760
Vyou're late, Dragon!

1211
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,260
How long did vyou plan to keep vus waiting?!

1212
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,240
Sorry.

1213
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,440
Vyou... What's that?

1214
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,230
Th-This is awful!

1215
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,310
You! Quickly, bring a doctor! This is an emergency!

1216
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,030
Call the ship's doctor, quickly!

1217
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,180
He's awake!

1218
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,310
Please don't shock him.

1219
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,750
Vi wasn't trying to do that!

1220
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,600
Oh, vyou're so rude!

1221
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,810
Huh?

1222
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,880
Where am I?

1223
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,750
You're on board our ship.

1224
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,410
It says "Sabo" on your possessions. Is that your name?

1225
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,130
Sabo?

1226
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,610
Dunno.

1227
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,400
"Dunno"? So what is vyour name, then?

1228
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,120
No idea...

1229
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,050
Don't tell me he's...

1230
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,060
Most likely.

1231
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,800
He still hasn't regained his memories?

1232
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,290
Indeed, not even his own name.

1233
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,790
I first met him in High Town, Goa Kingdom.

1234
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,210
I'm certain he's one of the nobles from there.

1235
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,720
Well, let's take him home then. Search for his parents...

1236
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,670
No...

1237
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,270
I don't wanna go back!

1238
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,820
Why?

1239
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,090
I dunno!

1240
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,710
But...

1241
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,250
that's the last thing I want!

1242
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,340
So you've had amnesia up until two years ago?

1243
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,220
Yeah.

1244
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,880
If it was that serious,
just how did you get your memory back?

1245
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,580
Ace helped me.

1246
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,540
That's what I think, anyway.

1247
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,370
Fire Fist Ace Dies

1248
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,960
The timing couldn't have been any worse, but...

1249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
That was how...

1250
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,380
...he woke me up.

1251
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,100
Baltigo
Revolutionary Army General Headquarters

1252
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,690
It's so hectic.

1253
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,390
Oh, Chief Sabo! You came at the right time!

1254
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,210
Report to the situation room at once!

1255
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,800
The Paramount War between the Navy and the Whitebeard Pirates has ended!

1256
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,230
Whitebeard lost?!

1257
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,370
Is Iva-san alright?!

1258
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,010
He's not listed among the casualties.

1259
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,050
The dead include...

1260
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,390
The Emperor, Whitebeard...

1261
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,890
and...

1262
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,420
Fire Fist Ace!

1263
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,140
But more importantly, Dragon-san, this here...

1264
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,760
Is it true?
Is Straw Hat Luffy your son?

1265
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,700
Hmm?

1266
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,760
Yes.

1267
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm gonna become a pirate...

1268
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,000
...defeat everyone in my way, and be known worldwide!

1269
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,650
That'll be proof enough that I once lived!

1270
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,100
Sabo-kun, what's wrong?

1271
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
You're acting weird!

1272
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,050
Have you heard?

1273
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,240
They say Akainu punched a hole right through his body!

1274
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,820
When you exchange sake cups, you become brothers.

1275
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,270
No matter where we are or what we do,
our bonds won't be broken!

1276
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,980
So from now on, we're...

1277
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,910
brothers!

1278
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,860
Yeah!

1279
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,120
Are you alright, Sabo?

1280
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,770
Sabo-kun!

1281
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,720
Sabo!

1282
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,140
That's right...

1283
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,820
This dead guy wasn't just some random pirate...

1284
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,980
He wasn't just some threat in the
Pirate Era that needed to be eliminated!

1285
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,330
Ace is my...

1286
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,180
brother!

1287
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,140
I won't run from, or lose to anyone!

1288
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,170
The Chief of Staff''s awake!

1289
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,440
Really? What a relief!

1290
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,600
I thought you were gonna die, Sabo-kun!

1291
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,420
You had quite a high fever, Sabo.

1292
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,650
You were asleep for three days straight!

1293
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,420
I was so worried!

1294
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,980
Huh? You've got your memory back?

1295
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,940
Yeah, I remember everything now.

1296
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,720
Including who I am and why I
left home and sailed out to sea.

1297
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,800
I see. Good for you.

1298
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,940
Are you gonna quit the Revolutionary Army, then?!

1299
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,660
Nope, no way.

1300
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,290
Is Dragon-san still here?

1301
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah.

1302
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,030
There's something I want to talk about.

1303
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,440
At that moment, I felt Ace say to me,

1304
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,380
"You're Sabo. You're brothers with me and Luffy."

1305
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,500
Finally... I've managed to come this far, Ace.

1306
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,700
Check it out.

1307
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,020
Luffy's started on his way again to become the Pirate King.

1308
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,280
That's our little brother for you!

1309
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,580
{\an8}Headline: The Straw Hats Are Back

1310
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
Sabo-kun?

1311
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,310
I want you to ask a favor of
the entire Revolutionary Army.

1312
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,860
There's a Devil Fruit that I need to acquire, no matter the cost.

1313
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,500
Dressrosa

1314
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,620
But, but Luffy-senpai...

1315
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,420
What about the Flame Fruit?

1316
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,540
There's someone I really don't want to have it,
but I got no choice.

1317
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,550
My friends' lives are more important.

1318
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,970
Ah'll definitely get ya the Flame Fruit!

1319
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,550
Just go do whatever it was ya needed to!

1320
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,300
Really? Thanks a bunch!

1321
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
I won't let you have the Flame Fruit...

1322
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,010
Straw Hat Luffy.

1323
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,970
Hey, hey, hey! Who're you?

1324
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,320
Why're you just casually talking to Luffy-senpai like that?

1325
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,670
He's the younger brother of that legendary pirate, Fire Fist Ace-sama,

1326
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,770
and the future Pirate King, you dumbass!

1327
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,000
I've known that for a long time.

1328
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,510
What's your problem?!

1329
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,730
Just showing up outta nowhere and telling me
you won't let me have the Flame Fruit!

1330
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,440
It's me, Luffy.

1331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,630
What do you mean, "It's me"?!

1332
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,940
Get this! The Flame Fruit is a keepsake of Ace's!

1333
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,200
If you want it, we're enemies!

1334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,750
And as for you calling me "Luffy"...

1335
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,490
See this beard?

1336
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm Lucy!

1337
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,300
You really think I wouldn't know my little brother's face behind that disguise of his?

1338
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,410
"Little brother"?

1339
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,150
Look here, the only people allowed to call me "little brother"...

1340
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,570
are Ace, who's dead, and...

1341
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,310
a guy who died way earlier...

1342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,660
Sabo!

1343
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,500
You can't be him!

1344
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,400
We stole a bottle of sake from Dadan and made a toast...

1345
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,380
Sabo!

1346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,770
What the hell?! Where have you been this whole time?!

1347
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,580
I thought you were dead!

1348
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,620
Thank you, Luffy!

1349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm glad you lived!

1350
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,720
But Sabo, I...

1351
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,100
I let Ace be killed right in front of me...

1352
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,740
I know. Even though Ace died, I'm...

1353
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,740
so happy that you survived!

1354
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,860
I almost lost both of my brothers without being able to do a thing!

1355
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,580
If you'd died too, I would've been left on my own!

1356
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,430
So, thanks!

1357
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,220
Thanks for staying alive, Luffy!

1358
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
Is it alright if I eat the Flame Fruit?

1359
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,000
Uh-huh!

1360
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,070
That'd be great! Nobody else can have it!

1361
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,000
That darn Luffy... He's smiling!

1362
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,620
Makes you wonder what he's dreaming about.

1363
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,390
Well, I'm off.

1364
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,360
So soon?

1365
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,950
I got to see his face, so...

1366
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,040
Here, I had a Vivre Card made from Luffy, just in case.

1367
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,220
Oh? When'd you have time for that?

1368
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,650
I'll be taking a piece.

1369
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,350
Alright. Luffy may be a bit of a handful,

1370
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,740
but please take good care of him.

1371
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,440
Yeah! You can count on us!

1372
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,180
He and Ace said the same thing.

1373
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,710
Sabo, that you? Hack here.

1374
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,740
Yeah, I just left. I'll be back soon.

1375
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,020
Roger that.

1376
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,280
So, how'd it go? Luffy-kun was quite...

1377
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,670
Why'd he hang up?!

1378
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,660
That selfish jerk!

1379
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,820
Whoa there, Hack-san!

1380
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,370
We're all set to depart, right?

1381
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,270
Yeah, anytime.

1382
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,380
Alright!

1383
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,600
Once we return to Baltigo, there's so much I have to tell Dragon-san about Luffy!

1384
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
I really am...

1385
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,220
glad I got to see him again.

1386
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,620
Let's move out!

1387
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,900
Dressrosa

1388
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,540
What is it? Could you look for me?

1389
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,480
It's a "one".

1390
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,610
I see. The only side that would be in Straw Hat's favor...

1391
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,460
That's what we agreed upon, yes?

1392
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,120
Yes, it is, but...

1393
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,620
Then, he won this one.

1394
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,190
We shan't arrest him tonight.

1395
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,960
You can't determine that just by a roll of the die, Isshou-san!

1396
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,190
We ran all over the entire country and finally found out where he is!

1397
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,270
After all the disrespect you showed Fleet Admiral Sakazuki...

1398
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,630
If we want to take down Law and Straw Hat, now's our chance!

1399
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,180
Maynard-san!

1400
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,180
A man ought not complain after the die is cast.

1401
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,320
Quite pathetic of you, really.

1402
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,230
Royal Palace

1403
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,660
Has anyone seen Lucy after all that?

1404
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,010
No, nobody did.

1405
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,560
I just wanna thank him!

1406
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,710
There's already quite a fuss out there.

1407
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,690
Even if they truly are pirates or criminals,

1408
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,220
they're unquestionably our saviors.

1409
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Grandfather!

1410
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,600
Rebecca.

1411
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,080
Father, Lucy, and the others aren't here at the Palace!

1412
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,300
Ah, don't worry about that. Kyros called.

1413
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,180
They're all together.

1414
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,960
I see.

1415
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,460
That aside...

1416
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,560
Rebecca.

1417
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,240
If I were to return as king,

1418
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,560
that would make you a princess.

1419
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,000
The Next Day
The New World
(The Twirly Hat Pirates)

1420
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,140
Damn!

1421
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,560
We finally shook off Big Mom's ship
after all that trouble...

1422
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,540
So why would you get us into even more trouble?!

1423
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,960
You've no say in the matter!

1424
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,750
Do as you're told!

1425
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,140
I'm saying it for the sake of you guys!

1426
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,700
Don't stick your nose in their business!

1427
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,690
We should have waited patiently on the ship.
You're pretty stupid to be rushing ahead like this!

1428
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,150
Shut up and do what I tell you!

1429
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,160
You gonna do it?!

1430
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,560
Or would you rather I crush your heart?!

1431
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,790
Fine! But I won't forget this.

1432
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,650
It was the right call to come ashore!

1433
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,340
We can still save them! We need your help!

1434
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,790
In that case, why don't you treat me more nicely...

1435
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,940
You say something?!

1436
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,280
Stop threatening me with that!

1437
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,850
Hurry up, Caesar!

1438
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,340
Stop telling me what to do, you blasted raccoon dog!

1439
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm a reindeer!

1440
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,300
What's the difference?!

1441
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,580
Shut up! Just hurry up!

1442
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,420
If they die because of you, I'll make you pay for it!

1443
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,680
We need your help!

1444
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,480
It's hard to run here!

1445
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,900
I can't believe we were separated
from Sanji-san and the others.

1446
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,980
We're in trouble!

1447
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,260
We were too captivated by the mystery girl.

1448
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,340
Oh, watch out, Nami-san!

1449
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,920
Watch out, me!

1450
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,160
No, how could you?!
How could you?! How could you?!

1451
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,020
Onami, they are upon us!

1452
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Yahoo!

1453
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,250
Is this it, invaders?

1454
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,360
Hey! Where'd you hide that girl?

1455
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,080
How'd you guys make it onto this island?

1456
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,070
Answer me! This place is pretty hard to-

1457
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,200
What... what's going on?!

1458
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,800
What is it this time?!

1459
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,960
It's a Rain-Ruption!

1460
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Again?

1461
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,540
Get down!

1462
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,230
What is that?!

1463
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,560
"Rain"?

1464
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,840
That's way off! It's a deluge!

1465
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,060
I shall protect you no matter what!

1466
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,620
No!

1467
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
Nami-san!

1468
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,340
Momonosuke-san!

1469
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,540
Help me!

1470
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,050
Assist me, too!

1471
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,910
Geez!

1472
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,420
You Devil Fruit users are such pains in the butt!

1473
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you!

1474
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,360
You won't get away from me, you damned invaders!

1475
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Come on, pull yourself together!

1476
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,670
Thank you, as always.

1477
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,390
You too, Momo!

1478
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,740
I am in your debt.

1479
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,080
When in doubt...

1480
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,400
Just kill!

1481
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,090
Brook!

1482
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,100
Sir Bones!

1483
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,640
I finally managed to protect you!

1484
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,980
Please allow me to handle the rest!

1485
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,210
Tsk! How arrogant!

1486
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,820
Sheep's Horn!

1487
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,230
What?!

1488
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,660
What are those arms?

1489
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,840
Sir Bones!

1490
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,080
Take this!

1491
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,320
Soul Parade!

1492
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,440
Sir Bones, that is amazing!

1493
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,400
What manner of ability is this?

1494
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,480
Brook!

1495
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,120
Keep stalling him!

1496
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,080
Diable Mouton...

1497
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,540
Shot!

1498
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,460
Sheepshead-sama!

1499
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,410
Sanji-kun!

1500
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,380
Oh, Nami-swan!

1501
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,180
Who are you people?!

1502
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,100
And just who are you people...

1503
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,620
What? How creepy!

1504
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,180
Ginrummy-sama!

1505
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,770
You lot there! Retreat!

1506
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,770
Sheepshead-sama has been done in!

1507
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,940
What?!

1508
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,130
But we haven't found the samurai yet!

1509
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,270
We've cornered them this far,
and he still hasn't shown himself!

1510
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,140
"The samurai's not here." Tell him exactly that!

1511
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,820
Yes, ma'am!

1512
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,660
The water's draining away...

1513
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,620
What was that all about, I wonder?

1514
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,870
It's certainly one strange island.

1515
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,150
I hope that girl's okay, too...

1516
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,630
She's more agile than we are. She'll be quite alright.

1517
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,570
You're right.

1518
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,080
Hey, guys!

1519
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,060
Get over here right now!

1520
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,080
That be Chop'emon, in the lower forest!

1521
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,140
Then let's move out! There's no time to lose!

1522
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,890
The Kid Pirates' Safe House

1523
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,660
What's that noise?

1524
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,020
What happened?

1525
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,250
Captain, there's a massive hole!

1526
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,470
A hole?

1527
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,740
Something's landed!

1528
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,590
Take arms!

1529
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,770
Yeah!

1530
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,130
That's it!

1531
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,780
It certainly is quite large.

1532
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,250
Where did it fall from?

1533
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,720
Just who in the hell caused this?!

1534
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,760
Hey, doesn't it look human-shaped?

1535
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,160
If I recall correctly...

1536
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,640
There's a legend about a sky island where some monster lives...

1537
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,360
Somewhere in the sky, around here, right?

1538
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,960
Are you telling me that it was pushed off of a sky island?!

1539
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,640
Captain Kid!

1540
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,450
One of our ships was capsized by the impact!

1541
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,620
What'd you say?!

1542
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,860
Damn it all! Who did this?!

1543
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,500
{\an8}The strong live, and the weak die.

1544
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,640
{\an8}That is just how the world is.

1545
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,880
{\an8}A few minutes ago...

1546
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,800
Sky Island - The Ruins of Balloon Terminal

1547
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,060
What exactly are you doing?

1548
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,290
Let us leave him be, High Priest!

1549
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,980
He must be insane!

1550
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,720
We're ten thousand meters up in the air.

1551
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,120
{\an8}This man was looking for a place to die.

1552
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,160
If he's serious, why bother to stop him?

1553
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,580
{\an8}To sum up his life,

1554
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,180
{\an8}he had been defeated seven times as a pirate,

1555
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,620
{\an8}and was captured by the Navy or his enemies eighteen times.

1556
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:51,820
{\an8}He underwent torture repeatedly, and lived as a criminal.

1557
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,910
{\an8}He wanted to commit suicide...

1558
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,160
{\an8}in an extraordinary way by jumping off of a sky island.

1559
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,370
{\an8}Hence, the current situation.

1560
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,960
{\an8}It bears repeating:

1561
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,100
{\an8}Single-handedly, he challenged
the Navy and the Emperors,

1562
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,590
{\an8}was captured eighteen times,
and sentenced to death forty times.

1563
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,280
{\an8}When hanged, the chain broke.

1564
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,980
{\an8}When put under the guillotine,
the blade shattered.

1565
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,250
{\an8}When sentenced to impalement,
the spear splintered.

1566
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,560
{\an8}Consequently, he sank nine prison ships.

1567
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,260
{\an8}In short, no one could kill him.

1568
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,830
{\an8}And that included himself.

1569
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,820
What is it now?

1570
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,140
What the hell is that monster?

1571
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,250
Damn, my head hurts.

1572
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,280
Guess it's hard to die.

1573
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,540
I survived again.

1574
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,370
I'm impressed he pulled it off...

1575
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,500
That old man, Whitebeard.

1576
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,310
{\an8}The man searching for his deathbed:

1577
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,480
{\an8}Kaidou of the Beasts

1578
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:13,400
{\an8}People say, "If it's one-on-one, Kaidou will win."

1579
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:24,290
{\an8}Whether on land, sea, or air, he is the pirate known as "the mightiest being alive".

1580
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,710
I've no choice, have I?!

1581
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,100
Damn it all!

1582
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,910
Hurry up, Joker!

1583
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,860
Make ready for the final battle!

1584
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,240
I don't care if this boring world is laid to waste!

1585
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,360
Let's start the greatest war the world's ever seen!

1586
