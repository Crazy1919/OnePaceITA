1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,950
Fight, crash in, rise up

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,160
Those are our Hard knock days

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,000
Ordinary days won't quench our thirst

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,250
Here we go, always, don't run away

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,330
Let's go on living buffeted 
by the mighty winds

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,030
We're still far from our goal

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,850
We got to carry on Hard knock days

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,770
Let's do it again, yes, how many times, baby

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,270
do I have to get up to 
make my dream come true

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,880
Feels like the strength of my resolve is

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,580
put to the test everyday

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,850
Hey Let's go

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,620
I don't want to settle for 
small success, making excuses

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,120
Hey Let's go

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,820
The world I got out into is wild and lawless

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,340
Whiffing through the air, 
off-guard, reality countered me

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,630
Mercilessly, beat me, hit 
me, and even if I fall again

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,520
Oh

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,730
Only those who get back on 
their feet and look forward

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,980
will have the last laugh, only winner

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,280
(We gotta go, till we make 
it there, on the glory road)

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,700
Fight, shake it off, act strong

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,880
Those are our Hard knock days

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,960
A safe bet? There's no such thing

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,290
Here we go, always, be the best

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,340
and keep going without 
thinking of the consequences

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,970
Put all our wishes together

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,150
We got to carry on Hard knock days

29
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,670
A Man's World

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
Team Kin'emon

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,680
Executive tower

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,680
Junkyard

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,390
Somebody was in the wall?!

34
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm glad that you're okay!

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,310
Kanjuro!

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,140
Oh, Kin'emon!

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,920
This is great!

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,780
Really!

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm sorry. I think I made you search for me a bit.

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,640
Some strange things happened one after another...

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,360
so I was planning to hide myself in the wall for a while.

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,540
A samurai from the Wano Country
Evening Shower Kanjuro

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,290
But I fell asleep before I knew it.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,260
Anyway, Kin'emon,
I can't believe you came back!

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,540
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long!

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,710
I trusted you so I didn't mind even a bit.
Don't be so stiff and formal, friend.

47
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,620
With my sorcery,
I didn't have a problem getting food.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,180
Oh well, I'm not hungry at all but...

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,720
Want some lettuce?

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,240
No, I don't.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,760
Your food never agrees with my stomach.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,880
Well, as long as
you and Momonosuke are okay...

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes, we are, thanks to you!

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,710
Good. I hope I can see Momonosuke soon.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,660
Yeah, Momonosuke is looking forward to seeing you, too!

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,470
So many things happened since I last saw you, but I can't put it in a nutshell!

57
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,060
We have a lot to talk about!
I'll tell you later!

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay, got it! Let's get out of here!

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,780
Get out?

60
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,060
Is there a way to get out of here?

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
Is he...?

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Drawing something?

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,420
Come on out!

64
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,090
Spring Sparrow!

65
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,020
What?!

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,320
No way!

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,800
His drawing started moving!

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Is he a Devil Fruit eater?

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,010
That picture of a bird came to life!

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,820
But the drawing is terrible...

71
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,520
His ability is amazing,

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,860
but because of his drawing skills, that sparrow doesn't seem to be too good at flying...

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,400
Now, Kin'emon, let's go!

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,700
Uh-huh.

75
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,480
Wait a sec!

76
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,060
We're former King Riku army soldiers and citizens that had been living as toys...

77
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,100
We don't know what's going on
but is King Riku alright?!

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,760
Our families are in the town!

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,380
Take us out with you! I beg you!

80
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
Colosseum Army

81
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
Royal Palace

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
4th level

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
3rd level

84
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
2nd level

85
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
1st level

86
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,910
Stop Straw Hat and the others!

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Why don't you aim at us?!

88
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,880
Guillotine High-Heel!

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,920
Oh, the Longleg got beat!

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,410
Don't look away, Straw Hat!

91
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,550
We must get to the Palace wher Doflamingo is, at any cost!

92
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,660
I knew it when I heard Doflamingo's speech!

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,890
It's a game to kill me.

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,800
Kill or get killed.

95
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,900
Everyone in this country will become hunters!

96
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,700
The only way for you to survive is...

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,900
...to kill somebody!

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,480
This game called the Birdcage is all fake!

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,960
As soon as the weapon trafficking and the secret with the toys were revealed,

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,840
all the people currently in this country were sentenced to extermination, I think.

101
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,290
Doflamingo won't let any information out of the country.

102
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,940
That's why he enclosed the island in the Birdcage.

103
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,550
Which means right now Dressrosa is...

104
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,280
...a solitary island, cut off from the rest of the world!

105
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,320
Believing in miracles and waiting for the end of the game will get us all killed!

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,930
The only way to get out of this island alive is to move forward and kill Doflamingo.

107
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,450
There are a variety of troubles in this country...

108
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,240
So many unexpected things are happening around him

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,660
but it seems Doflamingo is enjoying it.

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,940
I don't know anyone who's more cunning than Doflamingo.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,130
Doflamingo is a notch above all the others on all fronts but he made just one mistake!

112
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:35,300
He brought in all those odd, tough warriors from all over the world for the event at the Colosseum.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,900
We're not gonna be defeated!

114
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,670
Because, after all, I will take down Doflamingo!

115
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,260
What are you talking about?!
I said I'm gonna kick Mingo's ass!

116
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,150
I said it would be me, Straw Hat-ya!

117
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,780
I'm very impressed, but I'm gonna do it!

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,180
Soldier! You said you wanna kill one of the Executives!

119
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,040
That's a personal thing!
Taking back King Riku's country is my inevitable duty!

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,300
I have to put an end to the tragedy that started 10 years ago!

121
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,500
If you talk about time, I have a grudge from 13 years ago!

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
Then, mine's from 30 years ago!

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,820
Don't lie! There's no way that you're older than me!

124
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
You guys, get off!

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,820
You get off!

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,560
The road's ending!

127
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,720
Almost there! The third level!

128
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,500
All right!
Go straight to the fourth level like this!

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,530
Horse!

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
What are those giant dolls?!

131
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,570
On top of the
Pica statue

132
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,400
Zoro vs. Pica

133
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,500
How could you even think you were good enough to kill Straw Hat?

134
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,960
You bastard!

135
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,750
Damn!

136
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,420
I guess he got away!

137
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Pulpostone!

138
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,740
What?!

139
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,230
Why're you guys flying?!

140
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,880
Zo-!

141
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,140
Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoro-senpai!

142
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,120
Oh! D-Do you remember you promised me your autograph?!

143
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,380
That's... Pica!

144
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,220
Rebecca!

145
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,530
Who is it?

146
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,520
He's one of the Top Executives of the Donquixote Family along with Trebol and Diamante!

147
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,660
Zoro! Keep the enemy there for us!

148
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,120
We have to move beyond this stone figure!

149
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,080
Flower Field

150
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,080
Current Location

151
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,760
I can do that but...

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
That aside, why're you guys flying...?

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,830
Oh? The enemy got away, didn't he?!

154
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,880
No, he didn't get away!

155
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,940
I won't let you get to the Palace!

156
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,160
He got in there...

157
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,460
What?!

158
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,820
H-He's targeting us!

159
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,840
Oh yeah! Your barrier!

160
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,330
I can't put up a barrier that can cover us from that massive punch!

161
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,400
No! But if nothing is done, we're gonna...

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,820
...get blown away!

163
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Three-Sword Style!

164
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,880
Thousand-and-Eighty Pound Phoenix!

165
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm starting to see how your power works!

166
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,960
I forgot to tell you one thing.

167
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,320
The Straw Hats are...

168
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,880
...not just Straw Hat Luffy and God Usopp.

169
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,180
Don't forget!

170
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm the man who's destined to become the greatest swordsman in the world one day!

171
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,800
Zoro-senpai!

172
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,550
Further beneath the
Trading port

173
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,530
Executive tower

174
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,530
Scrap Heap

175
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Awesome!

176
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,060
Thank you, samurai!

177
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,820
We can get out from here finally!

178
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,560
Take turns climbing out!

179
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,240
Since it's a pictorial ladder, it breaks easily!

180
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,140
The lines aren't straight so it's hard to climb!

181
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,900
Stop complaining!
You've got a lot of nerve!

182
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,980
Inside the SMILE Factory

183
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,400
The Little People are going crazy!

184
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,120
Keep them down!

185
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,180
It's no good!
We can't get control of them!

186
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,720
Don't give up! Keep shooting!

187
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,820
We're not gonna get hit by bad people's bullets!

188
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,900
W-Wait! Aren't you worried about Princess Mansherry?!

189
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,350
What?

190
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,820
If you guys get out of here, Princess Mansherry will never get cured!

191
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,290
Th-That's not good!

192
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,960
No! Don't listen to them, Chao!

193
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,470
Okay, if you understand, quit fighting and just obey us...

194
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,260
What?!

195
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,400
I put in earplugs so I can't hear your stupid lies anymore!

196
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,300
Tontatta Swing!

197
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
Report Young Master-sama!

198
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,290
O-Okay!

199
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,360
You can't do that!

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,280
Tontatta Tail...

201
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,780
Four-man Hammer!

202
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,980
Everybody! Release all their Transponder Snails into the wild so they can't call for backup!

203
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,800
Are you listening?!

204
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,960
What?

205
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,300
Earplugs!

206
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,210
Princess' Aide
Mouji

207
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,600
It's good that her illness was a lie!

208
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,000
But she's been alone all this time in the factory...

209
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,650
I understand!

210
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,740
Mouji... I Mouji understand your feelings!

211
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,740
Wait!

212
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,680
I know the princess is crying now!

213
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,350
She's crying and calling my name!

214
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,340
Huh?

215
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,360
Mouji!

216
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,340
There is the isolation ward!
Princess Mansherry must be in there!

217
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,890
I'm gonna save you now!

218
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,880
Oh, wait a second!

219
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
Why did you stop me?!

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,460
Look at that sign!

221
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,460
It says "Keep out"! We can't go in!

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,620
What?! You should've told me earlier!

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,540
I can't slow down now!

224
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,620
Mouji broke the door with the "Keep out" sign!

225
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm disappointed in you!

226
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,040
It means you're not allowed to go in without permission!

227
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,860
I'm sorry...

228
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,830
No one's in here! Is it just storage?

229
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,760
Are you ready?!

230
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,720
Here we go!

231
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,440
Hurry up!

232
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,530
In front of the SMILE factory

233
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,830
Oh! You're so relentless, Senor!

234
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,080
Almost!

235
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,900
{\an8}Franky Ear.

236
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,900
Franky Ear

237
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,810
{\an8}Franky was born with good hearing.

238
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,940
Hey, swimming guy...

239
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,560
It's none of your concern but...

240
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,060
...earlier...

241
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:05,880
I saw a weak old granny having trouble in the back street on the right...

242
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,930
Oh yeah? That's sad.

243
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,680
Turn the wheel and open the door!

244
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,140
Hold on! Shrimps!

245
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:30,360
SMILE Factory manager
 Kuween (20 years old, female)

246
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,040
You're pushing your luck!

247
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,660
I won't let you get out!

248
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,670
No! It's the factory manager!

249
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,260
You guys were slaves for manufacturing SMILEs right from the start!

250
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,160
Didn't you notice until now?!

251
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,840
Stop making a ruckus like fools!

252
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,050
If nothing is done, we're all gonna get caught!

253
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,590
Open the door already!

254
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,200
Well done. Guys!

255
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,430
It's a robot!

256
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,020
A robot came to save us!

257
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,460
Thank you!

258
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,580
A robot!

259
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,020
Cool!

260
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,840
Is everybody okay?!

261
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,900
How are you?!

262
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,040
We all came to save you!

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
To save... us?

264
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,740
I-I'm so happy for all of you!

265
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,360
Thank you, Robot-san!

266
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,410
His not a Robot!

267
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,940
He's our savior, a Big Human - Fraland!

268
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,560
A Big Human?!

269
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
What kind of person is Princess Mansherry?

270
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,820
Princess Mansherry is...

271
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,700
You fools!

272
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,440
How dare you pay no notice to me for such a long time!

273
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
The factory

274
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,870
is

275
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,160
my life!

276
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,300
I'm the factory manager.
I'm the most powerful figure in this factory!

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,960
You're Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats, aren't you?

278
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,760
You're a One-star criminal.
How did you make it this far alive?

279
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,750
What did you do to Pink-sama?

280
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,470
That fool?

281
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,460
Anyway, I won't let you do as you like in this factory!

282
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm gonna take your life!

283
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,540
Watch out! Run, Fraland!

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,180
Fraland hugged the factory manager!

285
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,840
H-Hey, what's going on?!
What are you doing?! Let go of me!

286
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
Did Fraland fall in love with her?!

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,020
That cyborg idiot, how dare he fool me!

288
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,880
There's no troubled old granny anywhere.

289
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,310
Well, I'm relieved to know that.

290
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh! So hard-boiled!

291
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,780
Senor Pink! I'm ready! Bring it on anytime!

292
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,980
Hey, stop messing with
the morals in the factory!

293
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,020
That bastard has been throwing me around with suplexes!

294
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,200
Was he trying to dig up a hot spring or something
with the back of my head?!

295
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you talking about?!

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
Drop dead!

297
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,040
Cat-Ear Punch!

298
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,120
Franky Southland Suplex!

299
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,960
No! The manager is...

300
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,520
That hurt, you jerk!
How could you use my head like a hammer?!

301
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,140
How dare you treat me so cruelly!

302
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,450
I'm the factory manager!
I'm the most powerful figure here!

303
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,680
Once she gets mad, nobody can stop her!

304
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,450
Please run, Fraland!

305
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,550
I'll cut up your body and suck your guts up with my vacuum then pound them into pieces!

306
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,240
Why don't you cry like a baby, you...

307
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,960
Fraland kissed the factory manager!

308
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,120
H-He kissed...

309
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,540
This guy just stole a kiss from me...

310
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,140
Now, get up, you swimming idiot!

311
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
H-Hey!

312
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,960
Wait a minute! What are you thinking?!

313
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,420
Why did you do that?!

314
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,940
B-Be a man about it and become my boyfriend!

315
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,310
You fool!

316
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,800
The manager just became a bit more feminine...

317
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,940
You can't blame him, factory manager.

318
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,350
What?

319
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,220
You got involved. It's your fault.

320
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,100
Pink-sama! But...

321
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,280
You cut in to a fight between grown men.

322
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,140
When a woman does that, how else can we seal her mouth?

323
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,620
Getting upset over a kiss or two makes you just an immature little tramp.

324
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,800
So don't talk about love or relationships or that sort of stuff!

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,860
That's right.

326
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
Love with a little chick like that...

327
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,110
...Would drive me nuts!

328
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,650
So hard-boiled!

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,300
Senor! Franky!

330
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,320
How hard-boiled you two are!

331
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,630
I won't let you destroy the factory!

332
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,530
Prove it with your fists! If you're a man!

333
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,600
It's gonna start! The men's fight!

334
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,410
Diaper Bombs!

335
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,780
Nipple Light Special!

336
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:56,900
In front of the royal palace plateau
Pica statue

337
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,280
Are you giving up on hiding in the stone?

338
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,780
How dare you let Rebecca and the others get away!

339
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank you!
I couldn't have done it without you.

340
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,120
Don't think shitheads like you guys can escape this country!

341
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,430
We're almost there at the second level!
Be careful where you land!

342
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,240
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

343
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,180
Hello, this is Leo.

344
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,240
It's Mouji!

345
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,070
Mouji! I'm glad to hear from you!

346
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,620
That means our friends have been released!

347
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,700
But Leo, we have a big problem...

348
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,250
What is it?

349
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,020
The princess is...
Princess Mansherry is...

350
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,020
...nowhere to be found in the factory!

351
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,640
What?!

352
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,850
The poor dear...

353
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,270
She must be locked up somewhere and crying "Mouji! Mouji!"

354
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,160
No...

355
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,030
Get to the old King's Plateau!

356
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,110
Yeah!!

357
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,580
Catch King Riku and God Usopp!

358
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,290
Former King's Plateau

359
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,510
N-No need to be afraid.
They can't climb up here that easily...

360
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,200
Kill God Usopp!

361
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,540
Father-sama, I just got a call from the Tontattas in the factory!

362
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,260
Oh, are they alright?!

363
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Yes.

364
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,030
But they told me they can't find Princess Mansherry anywhere.

365
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,240
What?!

366
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,440
What are you guys talking about?!

367
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,740
Everyone in this country is looking for us!

368
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,340
Let's run now!

369
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,880
Where are you gonna go when everyone in this country is looking for you?

370
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,440
It'll be fine.

371
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,760
They know the truth about the past.

372
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,350
They're not gonna harm Father-sama.

373
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,720
What about me?

374
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,320
If they're hiding Princess Mansherry elsewhere, it must be in the Palace.

375
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,300
She must be somewhere.
Search every nook and cranny.

376
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,340
I don't think Doflamingo has killed Mansherry.

377
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,040
I know he needs her ability.

378
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,300
Though we need that ability more than him now...

379
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:07,240
Royal Palace

380
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,820
A Certain Room

381
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,880
Here. Your food.

382
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,620
I want to go back to Green Bit!

383
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,110
Come and save me now!

384
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,150
Leo!

385
