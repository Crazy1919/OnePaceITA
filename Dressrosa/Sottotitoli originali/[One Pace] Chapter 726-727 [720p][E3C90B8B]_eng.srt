The bond that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

Gramps, big bro!

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,200
It stinks!

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,170
So you were thrown down here too, Boo.

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,580
Where are we?

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,880
A mountain of toys and rubbish?

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
That's what I wanna know.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,450
Another one's gonna fall, you should move.

Former Gladiator Ricky

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,820
I didn't know that such a large scrapyard existed underneath the country.

40
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,730
If I'm mistaken, please forgive me.

Dressrosa Squad Captain

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,730
{\an8}But I've got a nagging feeling.

43
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,540
Are you...

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,640
Might you possibly be...

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,240
His Highness, King Riku?

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,910
King Riku?

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,980
King Riku? That's impossible!

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,240
Isn't he dead?

49
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,220
Speaking of Dressrosa's former King,

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,160
I heard that he went crazy and was killed.

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,360
After having fallen so far,
there really isn't any point in hiding it anymore.

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,500
Indeed I am him.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,440
But please do not call me a king, Commander Tank.

54
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,030
Former King of Dressrosa

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,030
It's King Riku.{It's Garp Oji-chan with a new haircut >_>}

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,670
Riku Doldo III
(Rebecca's grandfather)

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,050
You were alive?

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,090
Thank goodness you were safe, King Riku.

59
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,620
I am only an old man now.

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,980
A sinful old man who couldn't even save his only granddaughter.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,020
It has been such a long time. {Xemnas: Can the editor change the wording of this to make it sound more formal? Mainly because Elizabello says the same thing a bit later, but since they're both kings and his tone is much lighter and less formal, I guess I just wanted to make a distinction between the two.}{Seconding this request. This sentence really should sound more formal, though I can't think of a way to do so myself.[/not a native speaker] -Starfish}

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,510
I am now...

63
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,210
Doflamingo's...

64
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,620
There's no need to say it. I understand.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,750
You were watching over Viola.

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,830
How could I ever doubt a man with as much honor as you?

67
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,660
It must have been a difficult decision.

68
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,360
No, compared to your troubles...

69
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,900
Oh my, so you were King Riku!

70
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,770
Oh, the king of Prodence.

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,300
That really takes me back.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,960
You have saved my country from crisis, many times over.

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,440
I'm glad you are alive.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,840
Hey now...

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,850
Ever since you disappeared,

76
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,530
there's been a power imbalance in the surrounding countries, resulting in constant war.

77
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,820
I'm really tired of it all.

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,020
Hold up, Elizabello!

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,930
You may be tired of it, but if someone's laughing, someone's also crying!

80
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,400
Someone has been making a massive
profit from instigating all the wars!

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,300
By supplying weapons to all those warring countries!

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,220
The broker is a man named Joker.

83
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,290
Which is Doflamingo's alias in the underworld.

84
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,580
But we don't know where those weapons are being made or stored.

85
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,750
Our Flower Country has been losing badly in the war because of those weapons.

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,630
Our entry in the colosseum's tournament was merely part of our investigations.

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,610
The Happou Navy was ordered by our king to destroy the weapons factory. That's our true goal. {Cecil: I cant remember if we use Happo or Happou}

88
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,370
King Riku, because you committed that act which allowed Doflamingo to become king,

89
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,670
many of the neighbouring countries are in big trouble!

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,210
Exactly so, Elizabello-sama.

91
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,940
It's true that we owe a lot to Dressrosa for what they have done for us.

92
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,600
But your worry for that man is unnecessary.

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,820
Right now, the name King Riku-

94
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,200
Shut up, Dagama!

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,730
You don't know what really happened on that tragic day ten years ago.    {Isis:didn't a prisoner say "what happened on that night " just an episode ago!! O_O}

96
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,060
How dare you speak ill of the king?!

97
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,310
It's alright, Tank. It doesn't matter now.

98
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,510
King Riku, I am also a former soldier of your army.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,270
As am I.

100
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,820
Me too, King Riku.

101
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,360
What's this?

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,250
The toys have started moving.

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,400
I thought they were just trash!

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,230
All the former soldiers of Dressrosa and even the toys are bowing down to him.

105
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,690
What's going on?

106
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,910
Wasn't King Riku hated by the entire country?

107
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,770
With such a large pitfall here, it seems that there are some secrets hidden underground.

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,290
With such a large pitfall here, it seems that there are some secrets hidden underground.

109
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,510
Understood. {Cecil: Would be really unfair to use this person's real name :P}

110
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,200
Continue with your investigation.

111
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,290
Big bro!

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,840
What the hell's this?!

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,880
What's going on now?!

114
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,070
Sai!

115
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,090
Big bro!

116
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,200
Hey, hey...

117
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,440
It's over now, so you can go.

118
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,260
Do not harm any humans.

119
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,230
And follow the orders of the family.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,380
Make sure you follow these rules.

121
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:56,410
Exit through that door and you'll reach the factory and trade port.

122
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,660
Go.

123
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,790
No talking! Make sure you work hard!

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,130
All the participants are powerful, so they won't break very easily.

125
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,290
What's going on?

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,310
My body won't listen to me.

127
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,840
I can't go against his words.

128
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,650
What's just happened to me?!

129
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,570
She did it!

130
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,570
Colosseum
Prisoner Gladiator Lodging

131
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,420
Hey, who cares about Cabbage?! Show Rebecca!

132
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
Actually, come to think of it, it's really hard to see here.

133
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,630
I'll cheer her on from somewhere closer.

134
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,350
Okay.

135
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,260
Oh yeah, I used to think
this country looked really fun and happy...

136
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,580
but looking at you guys, maybe I was wrong.

137
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,110
What you saw was the flowery world of the winners.

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,580
Doflamingo divides the world
into obedient winners and disobedient losers.

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,480
He's exactly like the World Government.

140
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,420
Those who oppose him
are losers who get treated like garbage.

141
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,580
Hide the garbage in darkness, and sure,
the country ends up looking perfect from the outside.

142
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,450
Let's go search for treasure!

143
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
It's just like the country I grew up in.

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,120
Once you start questioning things,
you see that something is wrong in this country.

145
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,750
We believe that there are even darker secrets.

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,460
You better be careful.

147
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,130
Alright. See ya.

148
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,510
Luffy-senpai!

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:08,500
Flower Fields - Riku Royal Fighters Rebellion Headquarters

150
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,850
{\an8}Ancient writings say that long ago, our ancestors went out to sea,

151
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,000
{\an8}searching for resources that their country didn't possess.

152
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,860
But when they were discovered by the big humans, they were brought to the brink of extinction.

153
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,850
There they are.

154
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,480
Dwarves!

155
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,580
But one day, the king of Dressrosa,
a neighbouring country, offered them a deal.

156
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:40,050
In exchange for a bit of manual labor, he would offer them the resources they desired and their safety.

157
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,060
The name of that king was Donquixote.

158
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:54,650
That's the worst part of our history, which continued until 900 years ago.

159
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,580
The age of slavery.

160
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,980
The writings that follow show what the royal family truly were...

161
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,450
Demons, through and through!

162
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,460
Our people were forced to work day in and day out, deep underground where no one could see them.

163
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:23,780
The big humans lived on the riches and prosperity brought by the Tontatta.

164
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,770
No one knows what happened in the void century but...

165
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,240
800 years ago, a new king was born into Dressrosa.

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,510
King Riku!

167
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:56,780
After hearing of the dwarves' inhumane treatment for the past few hundred years,

168
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,100
it is told that he shed tears and deeply apologized from the bottom of his heart.

169
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,170
And the next action of the
new king was one of repentance.

170
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,440
He said that we could take anything we needed from this country.

171
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,870
That we didn't need to work.

172
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,230
The king called it the work of fairies and calmed the citizens with laughter.

173
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,040
He successfully created the legend of the fairies in this country.

174
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,770
King Riku the First, you're so cool!

175
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:50,010
The country led by the kind Riku line even provided support for neighbouring countries in danger.

176
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,540
I can't say the country was wealthy and prosperous,

177
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,390
but it was a wonderful one full of smiles.

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,310
Our ancestors paid tribute to the kind King Riku,

179
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:10,330
by turning this country into one of beautiful fields and flowers.

180
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,610
That is the 800 year long bond between our Tontatta Kingdom and the Riku royal family.

181
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:29,280
But after 900 years, the descendant of the Donquixote family, Doflamingo returned.

182
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,660
Strangely enough, he is trying to replay our horrible history.

183
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:45,270
Over 500 of our people, including my daughter Mansherry have fallen prey to his sinister ways.

184
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,410
We mustn't let those times repeat themselves!

185
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,780
We won't let it.

186
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,310
We'll fight!

187
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,310
Indeed, to Dressrosa, and to the Tontatta,

188
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,520
the Donquixote Family's rule
will only bring suffering!

189
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,860
We'll fight alongside our hero!

190
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,100
With Usoland on our side, we can't lose. {Xemnas: Went a bit liberal here.}

191
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:21,500
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,540
I was thinking the same thing!

193
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,980
As expected!

194
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,470
King Riku was such a good guy.

195
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,180
He was nice to the bug people.

196
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,710
Who are you calling bugs?!

197
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,460
I meant it in a good way.

198
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,320
Then it's okay!

199
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,860
Captain-san.

200
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,470
The female gladiator fighting in the colosseum, is being called King Riku's granddaughter, {Once again, this cannot be here. She is fighting Logan later in the episode and earlier....}

201
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,960
Drop dead, Rebecca! {Xemnas: This is being said at the same time as Robin's line in the background.}

202
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,730
and is really being insulted.

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,730
You're the shame of Dressrosa! {Xemnas: Same as previous line}

204
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,150
The people of this country seem to hate King Riku.

205
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,420
I was thinking the same thing! {Exact same phrasing as thirty seconds ago, for the record. -Starfish}{Isis: it's okay since it's the usual Usopp's funny act}

206
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,430
Yeah!

207
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,080
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

208
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,950
On that day, 10 years ago...

209
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,950
Usoland!

210
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,570
an incident happened that caused King Riku to lose the country's trust in one night.{Isis: now it comes back to being that night, can someone clarify this .}

211
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,360
Even though the king tried to protect the country all the way until the end.

212
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,060
The citizens don't know the truth about that incident!

213
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,290
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect your mother. {copy paste from 651}{end copy paste}

214
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,660
At that time, Doflamingo tried to destroy the Riku blood line, but...

215
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:42,000
I took King Riku's granddaughter Rebecca and continued to run for a long time.

216
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,560
But, she was eventually captured.

217
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,830
And now she is put on show at the colosseum.

218
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,970
I'll gladly lay down my life to protect
 King Riku's integrity and Rebecca's life.

219
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,420
I am betting everything on this fight!

220
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,150
Just why are you...

221
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,720
I couldn't protect Rebecca's mother.

222
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,300
Never for a second have I forgotten what happened on that day.

223
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,020
Having been turned into a toy, she may no longer remember me, but...

224
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,430
I am...

225
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,370
Rebecca's father!

226
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,610
Your back's wide open!

227
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,840
What's this? Rebecca saw her chance and escaped!

228
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,830
Rebecca is scurrying around like a mouse!

229
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:42,560
And Rolling Logan is in hot pursuit,
taking down any fighter that gets in his way!

230
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,980
That's cheap, Rebecca! Fight!

231
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,840
Fight and let us see some blood!

232
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
Damn descendant of King Riku!

233
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,630
Your family's pure evil!

234
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,610
If you're her father...

235
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,170
doesn't that mean...

236
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,970
since she's King Riku's granddaughter...

237
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,820
that... back when you were human, you...{Honestly in this case even I'm getting annoyed by all the trailing-off. -Starfish}

238
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,660
It all began on that night.

239
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,620
Answer me!

240
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,250
You must be King Riku's...

241
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,990
No, actually it may have started long before that.

242
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,330
On the day when that woman, Monet, began working in the palace.

243
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Monet?

244
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,470
The bird-woman from Punk Hazard? {dat memory loss}{Cecil: The way he reacted to seeing her, YESTERDAY, you'd think he's scream his head off right there.}

245
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,050
This country has changed a lot in the past 10 years.

246
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,560
Both the land and its people. {Cecil: This is my favourite song from dressrosa, I patiently await for some sort of soundtrack to come out with it.}

247
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,510
Dressrosa 10 Years Ago

248
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,510
Hey, what happened?

249
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,140
Pirates attacked my house.

250
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,550
Though since the Riku Royal Army protects us, the damage wasn't that bad.

251
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,370
It hasn't rained in two weeks.

252
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,260
Yeah. But despite the drought, the flowers haven't wilted.

253
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,230
Why?

254
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,590
It's all thanks to the fairies.

255
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,770
They protect our flowers.

256
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,220
I want more food!

257
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,440
If you have enough energy left to shout, then you're fine.

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,680
We may be poor, but this country is free from war.

259
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,880
Don't you think that's more important?

260
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,930
Yeah! {...No seriously, this entire sequence just BOTHERS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. I refuse to believe that it could have been as idyllic as they portray it here. -Starfish}{most unrealistic reaction from a kid that's never experienced anything horribly traumatic like that before.}{Sewil: be more grumpy pls}

261
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,530
In the 800 years under the Riku Royal Family's rule,

262
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,190
this country has never fought a single war.

263
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,460
That's amazing.

264
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,330
Indeed. Miraculous, even.

265
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,850
Dressrosa was a truly peaceful country.

266
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,550
But then...

267
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
without warning, a nightmare descended upon the royal palace.

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,140
Who's there?!

269
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
Don't shout. Don't call for anyone.

270
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,650
W-Who are you?

271
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,490
I am Donquixote Doflamingo.

272
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,260
The rumors about this pirate Donquixote have caused me some concern.

273
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,430
Yeah, your worries were spot-on.

274
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,070
I am a descendant of the Donquixote family, the old rulers of this country.

275
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,650
I am the rightful ruler of this kingdom. The king has returned!

276
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,390
From what I heard, you robbed a transport ship that was carrying tribute for the Celestial Dragons,

277
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,360
and used that money to blackmail the Government into making you a Warlord.

278
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,360
They don't know how to deal with me.

279
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,870
The fact that I don't fear the Celestial Dragons really worries them.

280
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,670
If you know who I am and what I can do, that simplifies matters.

281
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,680
I'll sell you the country for 10,000,000,000 belly.

282
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,410
You'll sell the country?!

283
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,250
Normally I'd just take it without giving you this chance.

284
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,790
If I can use money to avoid bloodshed, then so be it.

285
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,330
But this country doesn't even have
10,000,000,000-

286
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,060
Of course it does.

287
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,370
You have until dawn.

288
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,080
No getting help from other countries. I'm testing your power as king.

289
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,210
However, you are not to tell your citizens about me.

290
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,720
You have two options.

291
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,120
Either avoid a fight by gathering money,

292
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,890
or fight and see the blood of your subjects.

293
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,200
Choose whichever you prefer.

294
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,560
Wouldn't it be better to fight Doflamingo, Your Majesty?

295
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,990
No!

296
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,400
Calling it "fighting" might make it sound nicer, but it would be manslaughter, an inhuman act!

297
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:15,160
But even if we try to gather up money, there aren't many rich people in this kingdom.

298
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,490
The fact that Dressrosa has been at peace for 800 years proves that we are not beasts.

299
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,160
Don't lower yourself to the level of animals! Be human!

300
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,190
I will not let people kill each other!

301
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,730
We have no time!

302
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,130
Send troops to all towns in Dressrosa!

303
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,930
We must gather up 10,000,000,000 belly from this country!

304
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,440
If we don't, this will become a kingdom ruled by pirates!

305
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,750
I'm sure that gathering the money will mean that I'll lose the people's trust,

306
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,680
but only for a few hours!

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,750
Once this is all over, I will do whatever I can to make it up to them!

308
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,350
That is all we can do.  We can't solve this through lies or stalling.

309
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,430
Keep gathering money for as long as you can! The life of this kingdom depends on it!

310
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,610
It's the army.

311
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,070
What could they want so late at night?

312
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,770
Isn't that Commander Tank?

313
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,030
Listen to me, all of you!

314
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,680
I want you to gather all the money you have and bring it here!

315
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,510
Hey, what's wrong?

316
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,520
Do you really think the king will let you get away with this?

317
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,720
This is an order from the king!

318
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,820
Quickly! We can't explain our reasons, nor do we have time to wait!

319
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,900
Please, just have faith in King Riku and bring whatever money you have here!

320
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,100
But this is just so sudden...

321
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,100
This is madness! There's no way they'll accept this!

322
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,510
A Projector Snail?

323
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,610
To everyone in Dressrosa.

324
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,710
King Riku!

325
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,040
It's King Riku!

326
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,520
I have a request. It's rather sudden, and so unreasonable you might doubt your hearing, but...

327
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,980
please don't ask me why I'm doing this.

328
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,250
Please just get whatever money you have...

329
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,830
and lend it all to me! {Xemnas: nuance and all}

330
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,990
The king's bowing down!

331
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,430
Your Majesty!

332
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,350
But why would he ask this?

333
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,730
It's just so sudden.

334
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,070
Your Majesty, why are you bowing down to your people?!

335
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,240
You mustn't! You are the king!

336
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,650
Please, stop this!

337
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,530
Raise your head!

338
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,820
If you're seen acting like this, you'll bring shame to your ancestors!

339
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,960
You'll become the whole world's laughing-stock!

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,090
Stop this, now!

341
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,970
I beg of you! This is no joke!

342
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:47,260
If you want proof of my sincerity, I'll gladly cut off my own hands or feet for you, right now!

343
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,820
Listen close, Tank.

344
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,270
Should the worst happen, I will at least try to take Doflamingo down myself.

345
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,060
King Riku, isn't that...

346
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,840
I leave the rest to you.

347
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,220
We must gather that money, whatever it takes!

348
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,400
Hurry up, everyone! Get your money, like the king asked you!

349
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,510
That's right!  The king is kind, he'd never do this for selfish reasons!

350
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,530
Yeah, he's gotta have some good reason for this!

351
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,820
Bring all your money!

352
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,150
Alright!

353
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,920
This proves the king's greatness.

354
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,200
Here.

355
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,600
Thank you.

356
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,940
Forgive me!

357
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,610
People have wholeheartedly trusted the Riku Royal Family for 800 years.

358
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,250
What a magnificent kingdom!

359
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,850
This country will be saved!

360
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,380
We will repay you!

361
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,090
Now carry the money back to the palace!

362
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,580
Hurry!

363
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,990
Commander Tank!

364
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,470
His Majesty is in the town of Sevio.

365
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,700
Look at the screen.

366
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,370
What?

367
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,780
Southern Town Sevio

368
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,510
Your Majesty. You didn't need to come here.

369
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,680
Run...

370
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,810
King Riku! We may not know what your reasons are, but we believe in you!

371
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Run away! {Why would you have two lines in a row with the same dialogue be translated different ways? O_O}{Xemnas: Well "run, run, run" over and over again gets tedious and the last one is extended.}

372
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,370
King Riku! What are you...

373
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,450
King Riku!

374
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,140
King Riku?!

375
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,750
No! Stop this!

376
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,860
King Riku, please stop!

377
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,120
What's wrong with you?

378
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,450
Move! Stay away from me!

379
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,660
Get away!

380
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,450
He's even killing the soldiers?!{can't the timing be a bit longer}

381
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,070
My body's moving on its own!

382
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,280
What... is going on...

383
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,970
King Riku?!

384
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,420
Unbelievable!

385
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,850
What a horrible king!

386
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,790
The night is still young.

387
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,330
Now, soldiers! You dance too!

388
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,990
Parasite!

389
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,180
Now the soldiers have gone insane too!

390
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,250
Help me!

391
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,440
C-Commander!

392
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,740
King Riku, why?!

393
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,180
He's never done anything wrong!

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,310
Is it something we did?

395
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,230
There is no excuse for this.

396
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,340
The country is done for!

397
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,340
This was Doflamingo's trap!

398
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,310
What has happened to you, Your Majesty!?

399
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,800
Please, stop!

400
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,370
Hey, hey! Can we start now, Doffy?

401
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,950
Don't be so impatient, you fool.

402
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,760
We will wait until the country has been plunged into the very depths of despair,

403
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,080
and they curse King Riku with all their hearts.

404
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,480
That is when the heroes will appear!
