00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,000
Is Straw Hat Luffy still here in this country?

1165
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,530
Confirmed, ma'am. He's badly wounded.

1166
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,600
I see.

1167
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,300
Soldier-san's Conviction

1168
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,030
Isshou, I heard what you did!

1169
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,410
Navy Headquarters Inspector General
Sengoku the Buddha

1170
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,410
The prostration and that spat with Sakazuki!

1171
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,450
I'm glad I'm not fleet admiral anymore!

1172
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
Cut it out, you expired rice cracker.

1173
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,190
Navy Headquarters Vice Admiral
Great Advisor Tsuru

1174
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,130
{\an8}It must be nice to be an inspector general with barely any responsibilities.

1175
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,210
Admiral Fujitora,
why haven't you apprehended that pirate?

1176
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,260
You know where Straw Hat's hiding, do you not?

1177
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,100
"The gravely-wounded pirate
who saved the country."

1178
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,640
Should I consider him an enemy?

1179
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,520
Or ought I let him go,
being that he's a hero to this country?

1180
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,230
I can't quite decide for myself.

1181
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,170
A die?

1182
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
This is no laughing matter!

1183
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,870
A die!

1184
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,970
That's enough from you!

1185
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh, how scary.

1186
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,990
My word!

1187
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,510
You've been using that to decide?

1188
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,140
Still, Tsuru-san...

1189
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,070
If he is merely some ordinary person,

1190
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,100
would he have been saved by providence two days in a row?

1191
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,580
Today marks the third day, and I haven't been cheating.

1192
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
You! I want soba noodles, too.

1193
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,610
Aye aye, sir! Coming right up, sir!

1194
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,960
I thank you for assisting with the transportation of the Celestial Yaksha.

1195
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,120
However, I'm still in charge here.

1196
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,210
So you'll allow me to handle this situation as I see fit.

1197
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:02,820
Right, but the Navy can't leave a pirate
with a bounty at large forever.

1198
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,050
Please become Dande-donors!

1199
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,180
People of the Navy, please become Dande-donors!

1200
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,230
Ah, you're here again today.

1201
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,850
Yes, I am.

1202
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,580
Oh my, look how cute she is!

1203
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,460
If it isn't a dwarf!

1204
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,750
I'm Mansherry from the Tontatta Tribe!

1205
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,620
She's cute!

1206
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,370
Oh, how rare!

1207
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,130
Ouch! Wh-What the...

1208
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,010
Show due respect, you lot!

1209
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,690
Princess Mansherry is the Tonta Chief's daughter!

1210
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,490
She's a princess!

1211
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,700
Why aren't you bowing your heads?!

1212
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,600
It's fine, Mousey.

1213
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,430
Oh, how merciful she is!

1214
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,310
To tell you the truth,
we mustn't show ourselves in Dressrosa...

1215
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,070
to anyone but members of the royal family.

1216
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,560
So I wanted to heal everybody's wounds without being seen.

1217
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,780
Hmm, but how?

1218
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,560
Town Center

1219
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,780
The time has come!

1220
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,360
Yeah! I've been waiting for this moment!

1221
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,540
Me too!

1222
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,240
Take it away, Gatz!

1223
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,630
Gatz!

1224
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,610
Dear ladies and gentlemen!

1225
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,890
Today, our dream will finally come true!

1226
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,140
For on this very day, the king shall return!

1227
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,070
That's right! After a decade,
King Riku will announce...

1228
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,610
his return to the throne today!

1229
00:05:51,560 --> 00:06:06,010
King Riku! King Riku! King Riku! King Riku!

1230
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,090
The entire nation is excited.

1231
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,390
They were fooled by a pirate,
held a grudge against their king,

1232
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,060
and praised wealth and violence at one point.

1233
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,150
But ever since they came face-to-face with death,

1234
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,860
they now wish with all their hearts for a peaceful country. {Jules, this "they're now staking their lives on hoping for a peaceful country." makes absolutely no sense. I'm changing it up a bit. -EaX}

1235
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,050
It's absolutely absurd, but I can't laugh at it.

1236
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,310
No one would find that funny.
I'm truly happy that they survived.

1237
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,460
But will I be able to make them happy?

1238
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,190
I wish I could become an omnipotent king,
capable of fending off even natural disasters.

1239
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,650
Come now! Don't get too ahead of yourself!

1240
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,950
I'm kidding!

1241
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,020
We'll continue on as we have before.
What else are we to do?

1242
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,770
You're right.

1243
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,510
Until the day Rebecca inherits the throne...

1244
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,470
Never mind that. Are you sure about this?

1245
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,060
I remember how stubborn Scarlett was when she was young.

1246
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,700
Rebecca will follow in her footsteps before long, I'm sure.

1247
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,360
What do you mean by that?

1248
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,180
Inside the
Palace

1249
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,830
There! You're all set.

1250
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,770
Oh, how lovely!

1251
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,070
Indeed, girls look better in dresses than armor!

1252
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,460
You think so?

1253
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,380
You look incredible, Rebecca-sama!

1254
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,620
Thank you.

1255
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,100
When you wear that dress,
you look exactly like Scarlett-sama!

1256
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,690
Oh yes, we've heard about your father!

1257
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:31,690
They say that Scarlett-sama ran away
with a prince of a far-off foreign land.

1258
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,280
And that left King Riku no choice
but to announce that she was dead.

1259
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,530
It's like something out of a romance novel!

1260
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,100
I can only dream about it!

1261
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,650
City Center

1262
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,140
A prince from where?

1263
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,430
I heard he was from a lush country with beautiful lakes.

1264
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,290
But the country was in a war at that time.

1265
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,280
She fell for someone she shouldn't have
and had a baby. That was Rebecca.

1266
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
Eh?

1267
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,500
But sadly, the prince died in the war and...

1268
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,180
Scarlett-sama and Rebecca-
I mean, Rebecca-sama, were left behind,

1269
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,660
so they were living in hiding in this country.

1270
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,220
I see. So she only has pure noble blood in her veins.

1271
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,780
Quite the odd rumor.

1272
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,070
Kyros-dono is the father of Rebecca-dono, is he not?

1273
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,370
Hm, I know not.
Do you want some lettuce?

1274
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,220
No thank you.

1275
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,860
Soldier-san is valiant...

1276
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,990
and he will always watch over you!

1277
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,080
Soldier {just draw the letters in MS Paint and then TS? :PI actually dunno how to draw scribble lines joined together formed as letters :S -EaX}

1278
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,210
Soldier

1279
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,330
Soldier

1280
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:05,830
Soldier

1281
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:05,960
Soldier

1282
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Soldier

1283
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,210
Soldier

1284
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,330
Soldier

1285
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,460
Soldier

1286
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,290
Soldier

1287
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,050
Hooray!

1288
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,220
Ah, they are distributing
Mansherry-dono's medicinal flowers!

1289
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,890
Such wonderful things!
She is doing an excellent job today as well.

1290
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,790
Get in line and wait your turn, please.

1291
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,980
One per person!

1292
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,450
Thank you.

1293
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,800
This medication works really well!
It heals wounds instantly!

1294
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,430
Here.

1295
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,360
Thank you!

1296
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,660
Dad! I got one for you!

1297
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,090
Today, I'll use this one for the wound on my head.

1298
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,230
Wow! It healed completely!

1299
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,420
It's like magic!

1300
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm so grateful!

1301
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,160
Navy Camp

1302
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,300
Here.

1303
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,950
Here ya go.

1304
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,210
Thank you!

1305
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,750
So cute!

1306
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,590
I see. We can donate our healing properties like giving blood.

1307
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,710
What a wonderful ability granted by the Heal-Heal Fruit.

1308
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,050
Alright, take some from me, too!

1309
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,140
You'll get enough to cure ten heavily-injured people!

1310
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh, we can always count on you!

1311
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,390
Then, I'll donate enough for fifteen people!

1312
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,640
What's that?

1313
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,050
Then, I'll donate enough for twenty people!

1314
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,410
I'll donate enough for twenty-five people!

1315
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,570
Alright already!

1316
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,780
Enough for a hundred people, then!

1317
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,660
Thank you, but I don't think that's possible.

1318
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,540
Tsuru-san.

1319
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,140
Would you do me the honor of rolling today?

1320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,860
If it is anything other than "one,"
we shall go after Straw Hat and Law at once.

1321
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,330
Kyros' House

1322
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,350
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

1323
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,980
Food?!

1324
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,250
My, my... and they all kept
mentioning how Rebecca-dono's father...

1325
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,050
is a prince of some country.

1326
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,910
Aye?

1327
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,040
Aye.

1328
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,340
What's that all about?

1329
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,340
That's a weird story!

1330
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,990
And I'm sad because

1331
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,990
Sabo's gone!

1332
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,710
We gotta hurry

1333
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,640
and catch up with

1334
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,640
Sanji's group, too!

1335
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,440
Be mad, cry, hurry, sleep, or eat!

1336
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,480
Just pick one!

1337
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,400
So damned irritating!

1338
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,880
Rebecca's father is the old soldier-

1339
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,120
You're not fully recovered!

1340
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,830
Quit being a pig and go back to sleep!

1341
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,960
Just who the hell

1342
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,960
made up that lie?!

1343
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,340
I started the rumor.

1344
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,030
The only people who know about Rebecca's birth are some people in the royal family,

1345
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,520
and some people in the
Donquixote Family.

1346
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,040
Countrywide, people only know of her mother.

1347
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,740
I started the rumor before they could find out I was her father.

1348
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,110
Why?

1349
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,120
I have a criminal record.

1350
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,620
I was ill-bred, too.

1351
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,440
I was never worthy of marrying into the royal family.

1352
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,740
And that's why...

1353
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,300
This is how it should be.

1354
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,930
No it ain't!

1355
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,740
Does Rebecca know that?!

1356
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,180
She must've received the letter by now.

1357
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,560
I wrote the truth about everything I've done in my life.

1358
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,460
I've caused her suffering for a long time.

1359
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,540
I want her to cut her connections to people like me,

1360
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,070
and live happily ever after, openly.

1361
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,950
That's the only way I can make it up to her as a father.

1362
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm thinking about leaving this country when you guys do.

1363
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,000
Rebecca's still a child.

1364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,020
I don't want her to ruin her chance at being happy by being caught up in the moment!

1365
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,660
I've also convinced his majesty!

1366
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,810
He's so not okay with this...

1367
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,580
What now?

1368
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,430
Commander!

1369
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,710
Uh, I mean, Kyros-sama! Leo here!

1370
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,620
Zoro-senpai!

1371
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh, Luffy-senpai! You've awoken!

1372
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,170
Good morning!

1373
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,930
When five members of the Straw Hats are gathered,

1374
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,550
they're too bright to even gaze upon!

1375
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,500
It's like a laser beam of epicness!

1376
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,150
If I see all the stars of the
Straw Hats someday, I'll turn to dust!

1377
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,450
Just spit out what you're here for already!

1378
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,990
Oh, yeah!

1379
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,260
There's a lotta commotion at the Navy camp!

1380
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,340
They're gonna be here any minute!

1381
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,580
The Great Advisor, Vice Admiral Tsuru,
and the former Fleet Admiral, Sengoku, have arrived!

1382
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,090
Tsuru and Sengoku?!

1383
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,510
What are those heavyweights doing here?!
They need to get lost!

1384
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,760
Sengoku...

1385
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,350
Leo, what did you call me for?

1386
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,350
Oh, the Navy is making their move right now!

1387
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,360
It's a six.

1388
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,670
And so heaven wills it!

1389
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,970
All naval units!
Apprehend the Straw Hats, Trafalgar Law,

1390
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,910
and all felons hidden at the Palace at once!

1391
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,330
Yes, sir!

1392
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,800
Admiral! Do we have permission to enter the Palace, sir?

1393
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,180
You needn't worry about anything.
I will take full responsibility!

1394
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,300
Roger!

1395
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,130
The Navy's on the move. Hurry up and get ready!

1396
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,710
They're finally coming for us!

1397
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,270
You need not tell us that.

1398
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,950
We have been prepared to escape at a moment's notice.

1399
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,690
We were merely waiting for Luffy-dono to awaken.

1400
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,170
Aye, if anything, I am baffled as to why they have not yet attempted to apprehend us.

1401
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,410
But we have a problem. We are without a vessel.

1402
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,670
You're right!

1403
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,270
Where're we gonna find a ship so we can escape?!

1404
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,440
Leo, did you do what I asked of you?

1405
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,030
Absolutely. I did everything you asked.

1406
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,650
It's dangerous here! Stay out of our way!

1407
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,540
We're in pursuit of pirates!

1408
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,870
Clear the way!

1409
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,210
Huh? They're after Lucy, too?!

1410
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,080
No way...

1411
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,170
Rooster-san, they look like they're headed to the Palace as well!

1412
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,200
The warriors are in danger!

1413
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,500
Gotcha! Thanks for lookin' out for us, little guy!

1414
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,660
We've been keepin' an eye on
the Navy the whole time ourselves.

1415
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,680
Luffy-senpai and the rest of you, I'll lead the way!

1416
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,900
Run straight to the eastern port!

1417
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,990
Don't worry!

1418
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,810
Our allies've been standing by
at strategic points for quite a while,

1419
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,490
to help y'all to escape from this country
whenever you woke up!

1420
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,960
We'll clear the way for ya!

1421
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,280
We have a ship for you at the east port!

1422
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,560
Thanks tons!

1423
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,710
We let Nami and the others take the Sunny, so we didn't know what to do.

1424
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,780
Aww, don't mention it!

1425
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,010
We all fought together as a team!

1426
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,780
We can't let 'em capture our king now!

1427
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,640
Bellamy! Can you get up?

1428
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,320
Yeah. I can even run.

1429
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,700
Okay, that's good.

1430
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,220
Trafalgar, why didn't you leave me to my fate?

1431
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,970
That place was supposed to be my deathbed.

1432
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,960
Straw Hatter insisted you were his friend, so I brought you along, just in case.

1433
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,550
Feel free to die here if you want.

1434
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
I've fully recovered, thanks to that dwarf.

1435
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,680
Why do I have to die fighting the Navy?!

1436
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,900
Just find some way to die, idiot.

1437
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,350
The hell did you say?!

1438
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,660
You haven't even thanked me.

1439
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,940
Hey, hey now! We don't have time to think!

1440
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
Let's just get running, my comrades in arms!

1441
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,880
Alright, let's go!

1442
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,990
They're leaving!

1443
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,240
Capture every last one of them!

1444
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
Open fire!

1445
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,810
Oops! Let me handle this!

1446
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,920
Barrier!

1447
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,210
Don't stop! Fire, fire, fire!

1448
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,470
Okay, this way, everybody!

1449
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,120
You'll be in deep trouble if you run into Fujitora!

1450
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,700
Whatever you do, don't get separated!

1451
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,330
Huh? Luffy-senpai?!

1452
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,330
There's something I've gotta do, so just go on ahead!

1453
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,360
What?!

1454
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,550
Luffy, we don't have much time!

1455
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,050
Do what you gotta do, but do it fast!

1456
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,750
We'll be waiting at the eastern port!

1457
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,790
Got it!

1458
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,770
Let's hurry!

1459
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,630
Zoro-senpai, you're heading south!

1460
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,050
But even that aspect of you is so cool!

1461
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,930
Huh? Lucy?!

1462
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,480
Yes, he's being chased by marines.
I suppose he'll be setting sail soon.

1463
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh no... I haven't even thanked him properly!

1464
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,530
Shall we see if he's run out of luck?

1465
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,260
Let's put it to the test...

1466
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,710
with all my might!

1467
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,460
{\an8}Going forward, I'm assuming command of all units...

1468
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,800
on behalf of Isshou-san!

1469
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Naval tent near
the center of
Dressrosa

1470
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,810
Continue pursuit of the criminals that were hidden at the Palace!

1471
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,220
Yes, sir!

1472
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,560
How are we faring with Straw Hat's party on the hill in Carta?

1473
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,230
Hey, this way, everybody!

1474
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,490
Sogeking-senpai!

1475
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,560
Even when you trip and fall, you look so cool!

1476
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,410
Is it really safe to run through town like this?!

1477
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,960
Don't worry! Let's hurry up!

1478
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,770
We're currently chasing after the pirates!

1479
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,820
They appear to be heading toward the eastern port!

1480
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,960
Very well. Put me through to the eastern port!

1481
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,180
Yes, this is the Navy lookout unit at the eastern port, over!

1482
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,180
Nothing to report, over!

1483
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,540
"Nothing to report"?!

1484
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,460
How dare you respond so nonchalantly?!

1485
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,350
The pirates are headed your way!

1486
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,920
Eastern Port

1487
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,190
Oh no, sir, it's quite peaceful out here.

1488
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,330
We don't need any more backup, over!

1489
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,680
You...

1490
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,750
State your names and Marine codes.

1491
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,720
Sir?

1492
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, ummm...

1493
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,840
Dammit all!

1494
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,340
The eastern port has been seized!
Send reinforcements east!

1495
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,020
Yes, sir!

1496
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,730
Bartolomeo's Group

1497
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,180
Go on ahead, straight to the port!

1498
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,600
Thanks!

1499
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,560
Don't waste my time by telling me how grateful you are!

1500
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,240
Debt upon debt!
We already have far too much to repay!

1501
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,820
I-I-Is that a roadblock ahead?

1502
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,350
Go!

1503
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,830
Thanks!

1504
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,720
Th-The criminals that were supposed to be at the Palace...

1505
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,090
have appeared in the ruins of the eastern town!

1506
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,560
What?!

1507
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,480
So is the Palace empty?!

1508
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,190
We're in front of the Palace!

1509
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,500
S-Straw Hat is...

1510
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,910
Rubber Rubber..

1511
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,400
Fireworks!

1512
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,820
Flower Field
Outside the Palace

1513
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,400
Rebecca!

1514
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,270
Rebecca! Where are you?!

1515
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,900
Why is Straw Hat in front of the Palace?!

1516
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,340
You had better not let him get away!

1517
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,690
Yes, sir!

1518
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,700
Rebecca!

1519
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,370
Hey, Rebecca!

1520
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,620
Somebody's calling for me!

1521
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300
Lucy?!

1522
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,420
Lucy! I'm up here!

1523
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,000
Lucy!

1524
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,730
You mustn't, Rebecca-sama!
You shouldn't be talking to a pirate!

1525
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,140
There she is!

1526
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,760
Palace
Courtyard

1527
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,770
Tank.

1528
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,540
Would you fetch Viola and Rebecca?

1529
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,320
At once.

1530
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,860
Let's go down into the town.

1531
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,960
We shall declare to the nation
the return of the Riku Family to the throne.

1532
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,630
Yes, right away!

1533
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,340
I have been looking forward to this moment for so long!

1534
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,200
Rebecca!

1535
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,980
Lucy!

1536
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,840
Lucy!

1537
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,650
Straw Hat! What are you doing here?

1538
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,300
Please stand back, Rebecca-sama!

1539
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,230
Lucy!

1540
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,980
I'm so glad!
I really wanted to thank you...

1541
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,240
Shut up!

1542
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,200
I ain't here for that!

1543
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,120
Are you really sure?!

1544
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,240
About the soldier?!

1545
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
You'll never see him again!

1546
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,810
Lucy... I received a letter from him.

1547
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,480
Soldier-san is trying his best to distance himself from me.

1548
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,580
He's trying to make me a stranger.

1549
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,020
Quit talking like you're my father!

1550
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,780
Why is that?

1551
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,620
Is it because I was mean to him?

1552
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,950
There's no way you can beat Doflamingo!

1553
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,250
You're just a one-legged toy!

1554
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,440
Does he just not want to live with me?

1555
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,600
Am I just a nuisance?

1556
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,180
How would I know?! Think for yourself!

1557
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,880
I gotta get out of this country right now!

1558
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,880
I only came here to ask if you were okay leaving things like this!

1559
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,150
Of course I'm not!

1560
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,780
I don't want this!

1561
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,620
Then you wanna come with me?

1562
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,300
Yeah, let's go!

1563
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,450
What? Rebecca-sama...

1564
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,960
Rebecca, Straw Hat! Please wait!

1565
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,220
Viola-san!

1566
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,360
I have a favor to ask!

1567
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
We're outta here!

1568
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,800
Hang on tight!

1569
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,680
Got it!

1570
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,600
He's escaping!

1571
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,800
My king!

1572
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,860
What's the matter?

1573
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,220
Rebecca-sama has been kidnapped by a pirate!

1574
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,130
What did you say?

1575
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,420
What pirate from where?! What did he look like?!

1576
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,960
Was it one of the competitors from the Colosseum?!

1577
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,250
S-St-Straw...

1578
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,910
It was Straw Hat Luffy!

1579
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,190
Rebecca-sama has been abducted from the Palace!

1580
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,670
Straw Hat Luffy did it!

1581
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,070
You're kidding!

1582
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,320
He's gotta be holding her for ransom!

1583
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,860
I can't believe Lucy did that!

1584
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,930
How audacious!

1585
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,620
Even so...

1586
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,940
I still...

1587
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,910
like ya!

1588
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,530
What are you talking about, Gatz?!

1589
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,490
See?! This is what happens when you place your trust in pirates and allow them safe harbor!

1590
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,500
Capture Straw Hat as quickly as possible
and rescue Princess Rebecca!

1591
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,480
There he is!

1592
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,140
Special sniper unit.
Take aim and shoot him down!

1593
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,320
The Marines just suddenly...

1594
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,460
Naval Tent

1595
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,490
Our men collapsed?

1596
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,410
Was it Conqueror's Haki?

1597
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,820
Negative, sir, they seem to still be conscious...

1598
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,250
Well, whatever it was,
they're going to escape from the eastern port!

1599
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,640
Send warships as well!
All units, head east for Carta!

1600
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,250
Yes, sir!

1601
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,920
Oh, there he is!

1602
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,960
Stop!

1603
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,060
Catch Lucy!

1604
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
Catch this!

1605
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,830
Whoa! What's going on?!

1606
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,030
Lucy?!

1607
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,330
That's my meat!

1608
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,870
I'm sorry!

1609
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,540
Rebecca!

1610
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,300
I'll leave you behind the hill and lure them away.

1611
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,010
The rest is on you!

1612
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,030
The whole nation is trying to protect you.

1613
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,390
If you're caught, they'll take you back to the Palace.

1614
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,280
Okay, I got it!

1615
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,320
You better hurry or he'll be gone.

1616
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,610
Thank you.

1617
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,360
Thank you for everything, Lucy!

1618
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,280
Sure, don't mention it!

1619
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,660
You're such a cutie...

1620
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,460
You're crying again.

1621
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,660
Scarlett...

1622
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,760
I've fulfilled my duty.

1623
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,360
Forgive me for lying about not being your other half.

1624
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,220
I did it all so that Rebecca can live a happy life.

1625
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

1626
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,830
Mother said that it's bad to hurt people.

1627
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,910
I'm teaching you this so that you don't get hurt.

1628
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,880
On your feet, Rebecca!

1629
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Be strong!

1630
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,020
Because you were a member of the royal family, you've had to flee from place to place,

1631
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
and endured endless scorn for a decade.

1632
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,320
That's why, this time...

1633
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,360
I want you to have your chance at happiness
as a member of the royal family.

1634
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,640
I can't stay here, either.

1635
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,700
Rebecca!

1636
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,870
Don't go making up lies!

1637
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,340
Oh, is this about the letter?

1638
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,470
I wasn't lying!

1639
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,580
In the past, I really was just some
worthless guy who did nothing but fight.

1640
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,450
And whatever my reasons may have been...

1641
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,220
the fact is, I did kill.

1642
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,980
So that's why...

1643
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,730
I'm not the daughter of some prince!

1644
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,220
I don't know anyone like that!

1645
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,720
It doesn't matter if he killed hundreds of people
or how tainted his hands are.

1646
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,080
I only have one father!

1647
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,820
I'm the daughter of Kyros!

1648
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,360
So don't go making up lies!

1649
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,760
Until the day you can find true happiness,

1650
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
I'll always be by your side.

1651
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,440
Stay by my side like you promised, Soldier-san!

1652
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,170
Y-You're fine with me being your father?

1653
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,980
Yeah! Let's live together!

1654
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,600
Father!

1655
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,400
Yeah... Yeah!

1656
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,580
Rebecca will not be returning to the Palace, Father.

1657
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,080
Viola... I thought as much.

1658
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,870
Indeed. That's what she wants.

1659
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,710
I'm sorry, Viola-san, but could you
take my place and become princess?

1660
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm sorry, Viola, but could you
take my place and become princess?

1661
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,100
Sister?

1662
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,740
This is the second time in my life that someone has asked me for such an odd favor.

1663
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,390
I see. Like mother, like daughter.

1664
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,620
Luffy still isn't here?

1665
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,000
Trafalgar Law's not here, either!

1666
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,790
Ruins of the Forest Town, Carta, Eastern Port

1667
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,780
What are both of our bosses doing?

1668
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,660
We can't hold back everything that comes our way...

1669
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,200
That guy must be...

1670
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,000
Fujitora!

1671
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,460
Fujitora!

1672
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,050
And there's a dangerous one!

1673
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,010
Luffy-senpai, hurry up!

1674
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,620
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What're we gonna do?!

1675
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,020
Ain't it obvious?
