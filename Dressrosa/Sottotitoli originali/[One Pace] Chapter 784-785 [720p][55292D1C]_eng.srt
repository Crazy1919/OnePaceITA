Run to the center of the island!

1165
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,460
Th-The buildings that haven't been sliced apart yet...

1166
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,890
...are being pushed by the cage and closing in on us!

1167
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,780
The country's growing smaller and smaller!

1168
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,130
Royal Palace Grounds - Second Level

1169
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,900
The bird cage is shrinking?

1170
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,300
So that's what's causing all the commotion.

1171
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,000
This is the true terror of the bird cage, dear!

1172
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,300
I can't believe this!
This is a really big deal!

1173
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,870
Oh! I called him "dear" again!

1174
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,130
I can't just stand here and wait for death
while sucking my thumb!

1175
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,260
Rouse our fallen allies right away!

1176
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,390
Alright!

1177
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,920
Former
Royal Plateau

1178
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,210
If the battle lasts long enough,
this plateau will be cut into pieces, too.

1179
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,350
What?! I thought this was the center of the country!
Isn't this the safest place?

1180
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,480
Look at the sky!

1181
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,060
The center of the bird cage is shifting, little by little.

1182
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,850
The center of contraction is probably the current Royal Palace Grounds, where Doflamingo is!

1183
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,450
Royal Palace

1184
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,450
Current Location

1185
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,640
That means this place will eventually...

1186
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,760
Hurry up, Hack! Please hurry up!

1187
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
Stop shaking me!

1188
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,760
We have finally descended,
but there seems to be quite the commotion!

1189
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,460
That way, huh?

1190
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,140
Zoro-dono!

1191
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,550
Where are you going?

1192
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,740
It's obvious, isn't it?

1193
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,330
I'm going to stop it, of course!

1194
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,200
That!

1195
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,160
"That"?

1196
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,270
Outside the Palace















Sunflower Field

1197
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,760
What a surprise.

1198
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,800
I didn't know there were dwarfs in Dressrosa.

1199
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,380
I hope your arm is reconnected properly.

1200
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,740
They said when blood starts flowing, it's cured.

1201
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,740
I know. I'm a doctor.

1202
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,380
When I saw the underground trade port, I understood.

1203
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,710
This battle...

1204
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,380
Even if we do take down Doflamingo, it won't be over.

1205
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,020
It'll cause tremendous ripples across the world.

1206
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,580
And you guys will be the eye of the storm.

1207
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah.

1208
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,990
That's the plan.

1209
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,000
"Gear Fourth"?

1210
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,060
That's right.

1211
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,600
Muscle Balloon!

1212
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,700
Gear...

1213
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,660
Fourth!

1214
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Bound-Man!

1215
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,330
Whoa, whoa, is this some kind of joke?

1216
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,660
You've grown quite large.

1217
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,300
I thought you had an ace
up your sleeve or something...

1218
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,870
You can't even stand up straight,
being all rubber and bouncing like that.

1219
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,720
How're you gonna send me flying like that?

1220
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,780
For two years,

1221
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,980
I fought against monstrously huge, savage beasts!

1222
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,070
To force them into submission,

1223
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,800
I needed this giant body and bounciness!

1224
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,140
How will bounciness help you...

1225
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Shut up!

1226
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,920
You won't...

1227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,280
be able to do a damn thing!

1228
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,200
Rubber...

1229
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,970
Kong...

1230
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,280
Gun!

1231
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,190
I-It's Doflamingo!

1232
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,240
But why?

1233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,470
Back off, back off!

1234
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,580
Why are you here, Doflamingo?!

1235
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,640
That's what I'd like to know!

1236
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,910
Run! He's gonna kill us all!

1237
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,380
There's nowhere to run!
It's just the bird cage out there!

1238
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,790
Downtown, eh?

1239
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,740
I was flung pretty far...

1240
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,780
He's bouncing off the air!

1241
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,710
Rubber...

1242
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,040
Rhino Schneider!

1243
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,940
Somebody else came!

1244
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,900
He's huge! And he kicked Doflamingo away!

1245
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,520
Who is that ball-like guy?

1246
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,910
Dammit!

1247
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,830
By hardening his skin with the Color of Arms,
he's multiplied its tension!

1248
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,260
That ball bastard!
He's nothing but rubber!

1249
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,740
I told you!
You're no match for Gear Fourth!

1250
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,120
Rubber...

1251
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,360
Culverin!

1252
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,820
Athlete String!

1253
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,780
He's hardened, yet still rubbery?!

1254
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,570
Attacks like that...

1255
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,080
won't work!

1256
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,710
I can't believe this!

1257
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,770
You won't get away, Mingo!

1258
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm gonna kick your ass!

1259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,740
Why?! Now he just keeps stretching!

1260
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,360
Keep going after him, Python!

1261
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,260
Enough! Down you go!

1262
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,850
Rubber...

1263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,650
Culverin!

1264
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,080
That rubber ball is...

1265
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,460
...overwhelming...

1266
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,970
...Doflamingo!

1267
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,160
Who is that guy?!

1268
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,730
Who cares who he is?!

1269
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,900
Go for it!

1270
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,070
You can do it!

1271
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,520
Royal Palace Grounds

1272
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,680
Did you see that?!

1273
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,750
Yeah...

1274
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,990
I can't believe how he changed.
Is that really Straw Hat?

1275
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,700
He's overpowering the formidable Doflamingo!
He's amazingly strong!

1276
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,850
But he's overusing his Haki.

1277
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,530
Overusing his... Haki?

1278
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,270
Oh, there he is.

1279
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,980
They went to play somewhere else.

1280
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,840
And here I took the trouble to come and watch them!

1281
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,320
Captain of the first ship of the
Blackbeard Pirates, Jesus Burgess.

1282
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,540
Why is he here?

1283
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,280
Chase 'em or wait for 'em...

1284
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,880
Either way, I won't let 'em get away!

1285
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,230
I'm gonna get what I came for!

1286
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,330
Just as I thought, he's after Luffy-kun and the others.

1287
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,690
But what's he really after?

1288
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,790
Corrida Colosseum

1289
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,140
Viola.

1290
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,510
So, all that remains is the decisive battle between him and Luffy-kun?

1291
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,700
Yes, that's right, Father.

1292
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,740
Of those ranked commander and above,

1293
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,310
Doflamingo is the only one remaining!

1294
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,540
SMILE Factory

1295
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,110
Outta the factory, Tontattas!

1296
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,450
Okay!

1297
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,880
We're outta here!
Get a super move on and get out!

1298
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,870
We've finished rescuing our stranded friends in the factory!

1299
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,970
Alright!

1300
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,130
The factory is tilting!

1301
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,260
Fraland! Why is the Smile Factory the only building that isn't being cut up?

1302
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,410
"Only" the factory?

1303
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,610
I get it, it's the Sea Stone!

1304
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,890
Sea Stone?

1305
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:17,140
Yeah, the outer walls of the factory are made of Sea Stone.

1306
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,360
So strings created by a Devil Fruit user can't cut it...

1307
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,960
But, look!

1308
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,610
It's starting to be pushed!

1309
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,560
Hm? That's...

1310
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Franky!

1311
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,710
Oh, Robot-dono!

1312
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Zoroland! Topknotland!

1313
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,780
Hey, Zoro, Kin'emon!

1314
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,330
The center of the country is in the direction you just flew from.

1315
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,190
If you wanna run, you're going the wrong way!

1316
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,940
We ain't running!
We're gonna stop the strings!

1317
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,530
Stop them?
Oh, I didn't even think about that!

1318
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,610
What?! That's so cool!

1319
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,090
Until Luffy settles this, we gotta buy some time!

1320
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,530
Oh yeah!

1321
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Downtown
Luffy vs. Doflamingo

1322
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,510
Using the Color of Arms to control the expansion and contraction of his rubber body any way he wants...

1323
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,150
A harmony of Arming and Rubber, huh?

1324
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,910
If I take too much time, Gear Fourth's gonna...

1325
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,630
You seem like you have excellent grasp of your abilities, but it must be quite the burden.

1326
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,480
Surely there are some risks.

1327
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,150
Rubber...

1328
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,040
Straw Hat, how many more
seconds will you last?

1329
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,010
...Double...

1330
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,340
My strings, however, will never run out!

1331
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,060
...Culverin!

1332
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,390
Off-White String!

1333
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,990
H-How are his strings
coming out of the ground?!

1334
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,250
What did you do to this town?!

1335
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,170
Listen up, fledgling!

1336
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:51,980
Devil Fruit abilities have yet another stage to them, called "Awakening"!

1337
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,540
The buildings turned into strings!

1338
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:10,430
In rare instances, an ability will "awaken"
and begin to affect things other than its user's body!

1339
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,750
All kinds of things are turning into strings!
This doesn't look like the power of a Paramecia!

1340
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,550
Anything that surrounds you, I can turn to string!

1341
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,970
You can't even come near me!

1342
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,750
And when your strength gives out,
my body will have...

1343
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,190
The moment your Haki gives out, I'll finish you off!

1344
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,800
20 Minutes
Later

1345
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,750
It's gonna slice us! Run!

1346
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,620
Oh, Grandma!

1347
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,630
Grandma, stand up! The strings'll cut you!

1348
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,370
I can't...

1349
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,810
I can't run anymore...

1350
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,750
Leave me here and go on ahead.

1351
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,830
No way, no way! I can't do something like that!

1352
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,000
I won't survive this anyway.

1353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,820
Please, get up!

1354
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,350
Even if I get up,
I definitely can't run all the way downtown!

1355
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,300
Somebody, give us a hand!

1356
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,020
There are still patients in the hospital!

1357
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,370
We can't carry them all by ourselves! I'm begging you!

1358
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,500
My son's missing! Has anyone seen him?!

1359
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,990
He's wearing a Kuma shirt! He's five years old!

1360
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,970
Anybody! Have you seen my son?!

1361
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,170
We're all gonna die anyway.

1362
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,530
We should just give up.

1363
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,550
No matter how far we run, we're still in a cage.

1364
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,750
We'll all be killed by Doflamingo.

1365
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,010
It's easier...

1366
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,870
if we just give up.

1367
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,510
Everybody, please listen to me.

1368
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,790
This is...

1369
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,200
the former king of Dressrosa, Riku Dold the Third.

1370
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,650
Wh-What?

1371
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,090
K-King Riku...

1372
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,630
Currently, our country is trapped within an inescapable bird cage,

1373
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,070
as part of a game started by the current king, Doflamingo.

1374
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:47,070
In addition, that vicious bird cage continues to shrink, carving up the town with it.

1375
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,560
King Riku...

1376
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,310
All too suddenly, reality befell all of you.

1377
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,370
I am sure your emotions have not had the chance to catch up to you,

1378
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,850
and right now you are simply trying to save your own life, or the life of someone else!

1379
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,850
However, this is not a dream!

1380
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,450
Nor is this a tragedy that has begun only today!

1381
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,680
For a decade,

1382
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,490
we have lived in this bird cage called "Dressrosa",

1383
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,890
under the reign of pirates!

1384
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:37,810
For a decade, we lived as puppets manipulated by them.

1385
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,010
Such is our reality!

1386
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,390
However, that shall soon end!

1387
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,420
The Donquixote Family that we thought nobody could match...

1388
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,150
...is on the verge of defeat, at the hands of the mighty warriors

1389
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,470
that are in this country by coincidence!

1390
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,440
The Family's commanders have already fallen!

1391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,480
Really?!

1392
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,670
Those commanders were...

1393
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,650
He's saying they were taken down?

1394
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,430
The only enemy remaining to be defeated...

1395
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,890
is the current king of Dressrosa, Doflamingo!

1396
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,210
And the one fighting him is the pirate, Straw Hat Luffy!

1397
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,610
I believe that he is the man
that will destroy this bird cage!

1398
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,290
Whether he wins or loses,
it will be over in less than an hour!

1399
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,990
Until then, survive! Do whatever it takes!

1400
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,430
I do not want a single one of you to be crushed by this shrinking country!

1401
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,610
Please, keep running!

1402
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,190
Even if you run out of breath, or if your legs break!

1403
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,270
Stay alive for just a few more minutes!

1404
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,080
There is still hope!

1405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,810
Please don't give up!

1406
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,840
We'll give it our all, even without help!

1407
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,620
Okay!

1408
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,130
Alright! Let's get goin', grandkid! {GRANDMA PLS}

1409
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,550
'Kay, Grandma! {DAT FACE... GRANDKID PLS.}

1410
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,130
Me, too!

1411
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,400
Just like King Riku said...

1412
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,390
We won't give up! We're running downtown!

1413
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,950
Carry the sick!

1414
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,050
Grab those beds!

1415
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,770
Mommy!

1416
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,210
Survive until the battle ends!

1417
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,780
Straw Hat Luffy's gonna take down Doflamingo for us!

1418
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,460
Uh-huh!

1419
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,090
Mingo!

1420
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,530
About time you dropped dead.

1421
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm runnin' out of time!

1422
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,450
The whole town's turning to string!

1423
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,570
Billow White!

1424
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,690
Mingo!

1425
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,490
I'm gonna blow you away!

1426
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,520
Mingo!

1427
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm ending this!

1428
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Rubber...

1429
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,080
Leo Bazooka!

1430
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,000
D-Do...

1431
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,980
Doflamingo!

1432
