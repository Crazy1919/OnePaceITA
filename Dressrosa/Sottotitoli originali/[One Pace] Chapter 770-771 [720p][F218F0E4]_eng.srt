00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,260
Shut up!

1165
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,340
This is...

1166
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,400
This is my way of settling things!

1167
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,960
There's no reason for me to accept this fight!

1168
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,500
But...

1169
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,000
If there's no reason to accept it, fine!

1170
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,420
Just stand there!

1171
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,620
If you still think...

1172
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,600
that my determination is cheap, that is!

1173
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Dammit!

1174
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,130
Statue of Pica

1175
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,260
I thought I was gonna die!

1176
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,580
The Royal Palace Grounds - Second Level

1177
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,880
He's alive!

1178
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
Pica-sama!

1179
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,580
That stone bastard doesn't know when to give up!

1180
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,660
You think you can take me down just because you know my ability?

1181
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,060
What a simpleton!

1182
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,960
Wait!

1183
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,300
Take him down!

1184
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,960
Don't move, Pirate Hunter!

1185
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
We won't let you through here!

1186
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,470
What a pain in the ass!

1187
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,810
Commodore's Dignity!

1188
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,230
Attention!

1189
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,580
Don't do it!

1190
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,700
No! No! Don't!

1191
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,570
Huh? Why are we standing in formation?

1192
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,140
Killer Bowling!

1193
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,500
You're something!

1194
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,500
You may go ahead.

1195
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,700
Yeah, you're from the Colosseum, right?

1196
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,510
Correct! My name is Orlumbus!

1197
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,600
Were this the sea, I would've backed you up with my Yonta Maria Fleet.

1198
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm sorry to be short-handed!
I'll leave the stone monster to you!

1199
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,380
Okay!

1200
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Where did that guy go?!

1201
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
The face on the wall!

1202
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,180
Pica-sama took over the plateau!

1203
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,740
Now, can you dodge my attacks?

1204
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,620
Now, can you dodge my attacks?

1205
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,620
That's supposed to be laughter?!

1206
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,190
So what if that's how I laugh?

1207
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm just surprised at how dumb it sounded!

1208
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,420
You're the dumb one, Pirate Hunter!

1209
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,680
Don't piss Pica-sama off!

1210
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
Charlestone!

1211
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,260
I'm glad you're so big.

1212
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,340
I'm sure it'll feel incredibly satisfying to slice you in half.

1213
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,260
Hey, Pica!

1214
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Don't forget we're fighting here, too!

1215
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,260
Destructive Cannon!

1216
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,160
You better pay attention!

1217
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,370
Is it because we're enemies?!

1218
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,780
Why don't you say it straight?!

1219
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,490
What are you talking about?!

1220
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,310
Don't pretend you don't know!

1221
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,140
I'll penetrate right into your heart!

1222
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,960
You said "I'll aim for your heart"...

1223
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,980
I won't let go of your hand!

1224
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,110
And "I'll keep holding your hand"!

1225
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,100
Can you keep up with me?!

1226
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,780
And "Can you stick with me"!

1227
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,340
If you want me so much...

1228
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,040
I don't care about the positions we're in!

1229
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,410
You...

1230
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,940
need me, don't you?!

1231
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,920
He's completely merciless!

1232
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,600
Even a warrior of Elbaf couldn't do a thing against Vise-sama!

1233
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,340
This is good-in! A good foothold-in!

1234
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,300
I brought down Hajrudin the Giant-in,
and my next target is...

1235
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,240
That's Roronoa Zoro!

1236
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,300
You're in our way, mega-wimp!

1237
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,540
My dream was to become the king of all giants.

1238
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,920
But look at me.

1239
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,060
I lost in the competition.

1240
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,100
I got turned into a toy.

1241
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,710
I was saved, and yet I couldn't repay my debt!

1242
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,370
How pathetic!

1243
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,560
If I was willing to sacrifice my life to repay my debt...

1244
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,170
then why am I still alive, after I failed?!

1245
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,060
Ton-Ton!

1246
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,530
Was my gratitude...

1247
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,210
that shallow?!

1248
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,740
Here I go, Roronoa!

1249
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,180
He's...

1250
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,700
Destructive 1,000-Ton Vise!

1251
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,420
No, it's...

1252
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,730
It's far deeper than that!

1253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,940
He got up!

1254
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,590
I'm sorry... but let me take care of that guy.

1255
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,660
Hajrudin!

1256
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,880
Hey, hey-in! I can't believe you're still alive!

1257
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,260
Then, I'll make it heavier-in!

1258
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,880
Hellish 10,000-Ton Vise!

1259
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,980
I hope there are still bones left to be crushed! Hey-in!

1260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,260
A dead man has no use, but...

1261
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,680
if at least one arm still moves, a man can even rip off his enemy general's head.

1262
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,360
Take this! I'll stake my life on it!

1263
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,010
Gungnir!

1264
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,660
It's no use-in! This is 10,000 tons!

1265
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,020
Get squashed, Hajrudin!

1266
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,740
Fly away! To the kingdom of the gods!

1267
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,760
What?!

1268
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,180
Vise-sama!

1269
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh no! Above him!

1270
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,060
He's gonna hit the bird cage!

1271
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,960
Stop, Vise-sama!

1272
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,080
He's gonna get slashed!

1273
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,340
I guess he can't fly outta there...

1274
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,900
It's not like he's a bird.

1275
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,320
Vise-sama!

1276
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
Rest easy.

1277
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,360
When you wake up, this cage'll be gone.

1278
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
Charlestone!

1279
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,020
Who are you targeting?

1280
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,140
Damn, he escaped.

1281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,660
Predictable as usual!

1282
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,020
I don't like this.

1283
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,900
Do you want me to assist you, Pirate Hunter?

1284
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,260
And you are?

1285
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,200
My name is Elizabello.

1286
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,360
King Riku is an old friend of mine.

1287
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,040
So this country belongs to my friend.

1288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,530
My King Punch is a trump card that I can use once an hour.

1289
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,740
Did you figure out the stone man's ability?

1290
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,760
Yeah, ages ago.

1291
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,320
Then leave him to me.

1292
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,880
Thanks, but I'll deal with him myself.

1293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,280
You better save your "trump card".

1294
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,420
We still don't know what's to come.

1295
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,760
If you say so, then very well!

1296
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,400
That damn stone... What is he playing at?

1297
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,900
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

1298
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,180
Ow, ow, ow, ow... Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

1299
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,040
Oh!

1300
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,390
There you go! Lao G-sama's...

1301
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,440
Back-Pain Stance!

1302
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,440
That fool...

1303
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,460
Take this!

1304
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,090
Geo-Fist!

1305
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,950
Eye-Jab Strain!

1306
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,680
Icy Stiff Shoulder!

1307
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,540
Immortal Warrior's Joint Pain!

1308
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,070
That's our Lao G-sama!

1309
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,340
He's overpowering the 500 million man, Don Chinjao!

1310
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,760
As you get older and understand pain, it becomes sharper!

1311
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,980
Geo-Fist!

1312
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,040
There's the...

1313
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,900
G!

1314
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm against this marriage!

1315
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,080
You're talking to them?!

1316
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,700
Were you listening, Gramps?!  I'm not gonna marry her!

1317
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
What did you say?!

1318
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,760
Why are you that surprised?! Why should I?!

1319
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:26,340
Sai! You're supposed to marry Oohlicia, the daughter of the Nihou Navy's leader!

1320
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,360
Sai!

1321
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,920
I know! I don't care who'll become my wife!

1322
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,850
Go ahead and marry me off...

1323
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,230
{\an8}Note: Nihou: "Two Treasures", Happou: "Eight Treasures", Juppou: "Ten Treasures"

1324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,230
to merge the Nihou and Happou Navies and form the Juppou Navy or whatever you wanna call it!

1325
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,770
This is bad. Lao G-sama is being ignored!

1326
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,220
He's gonna snap!

1327
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,030
Wha?

1328
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,480
He didn't hear a thing!

1329
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,560
But wait, he is mad!

1330
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,760
Look! He's letting off a furious steam from the top of his head!

1331
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,720
Nope, he's dying!

1332
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,340
How could he die of old age today, of all days?!

1333
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,260
This shouldn't be how a battle ends!

1334
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,130
What?! This can't be happening!

1335
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,160
Lao G, don't die!

1336
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,280
Lao G-sama!

1337
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,940
Come back!

1338
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,240
Back... Back... Back...

1339
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,850
What?!

1340
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,890
What?

1341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,420
He couldn't hear it clearly, but he came back!

1342
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm glad!

1343
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,980
The infamous Don Chinjao sure has gotten old.

1344
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,690
What's wrong with you, Sai?!

1345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,620
They're not talking about the same thing!

1346
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,180
Huh?!

1347
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,220
He really can't hear a thing!

1348
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,220
What's wrong with me?

1349
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,030
It was crooked.

1350
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,580
Hey, don't fix my collar! Are you my wife?!

1351
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,260
Stay away from me, Donquixote Family!

1352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,330
You shady creep! You're my enemy!

1353
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,320
Why did you bring up marriage all of a sudden?!

1354
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,110
Why not? You need me, don't you?

1355
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,860
What do you want me to do? I'll do anything!

1356
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,580
Yeah, right! Okay then, do me a favor?

1357
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,760
Drop dead!

1358
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,310
If we let you get away,
you might get in Straw Hat's way.

1359
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
Then I'd never be able to repay my debt!

1360
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,020
At the very least, we'll take out the commanders!

1361
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,720
Prepare yourself!

1362
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,260
Alright. I'll gladly die.

1363
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,050
If that'll help you...

1364
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,100
What? N-No...

1365
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,600
There's nothing I love more than being needed by others.

1366
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,230
Stop it, you fool! What are you doing?!

1367
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,230
I was just making a snappy comeback!

1368
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,540
It'll leave a bad taste if I win due to you self-destructing like that!

1369
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,320
Leave her be, Sai!

1370
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,990
Why would you want to prevent your enemy's death?

1371
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,260
Are you out of your mind?

1372
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,860
A leader of an army should be far more cold-hearted!

1373
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,770
Shut up, old man!

1374
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,440
Don't tell me what to do like you're still my master!

1375
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Hey, woman!

1376
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, I'm so happy...

1377
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,490
Just by dying, I can be of use to someone...

1378
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,740
Why did you give birth?

1379
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,990
Not only are kids useless, but they eat so much.

1380
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,460
We've gotta reduce the number of mouths to feed.
Throw her out into the mountains.

1381
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,790
Mommy, where are we going?

1382
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,540
Don't follow me.

1383
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,260
No, please! I'm gonna come with you!

1384
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,940
You're useless.

1385
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,540
Useless people like you...

1386
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,160
aren't needed by anyone!

1387
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,420
Even by you, Mommy?

1388
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,860
I'm not needed even by you, Mommy?

1389
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,540
Somebody needs me right now...

1390
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,240
Stop it you stupid woman!

1391
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,460
You're the stupid one!

1392
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,780
Gramps?!

1393
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,330
So powerful!

1394
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,710
That's...

1395
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,040
Sai!

1396
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,640
You bring shame to the Happou Navy!

1397
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,800
We don't need a buffoon like you in the Happou Navy!

1398
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,880
This is my problem! Stay out of it!

1399
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,980
You fool!

1400
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,240
Eight-Impact Fist Secret Technique...

1401
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,980
Don't tell me he's gonna do the head-butt that can break an ice continent?!

1402
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,350
I'm gonna shatter both of you with my drill head!

1403
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,560
Drilling Dragon...

1404
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,500
Drilling Nail!

1405
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,980
Bujaogen Heel!

1406
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,720
Somebody needs me right now...

1407
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,800
Don't be such an idiot!

1408
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,820
Why...

1409
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,270
Why did you stop me?

1410
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,500
I just tried to help you!

1411
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,260
By killing myself, I wanted to become useful to someone!

1412
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,070
Have you been living in a world where nobody's ever told you...

1413
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,360
that you've got it all wrong?

1414
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,870
Don Chinjao's drill head is bent!

1415
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,140
Unbelievable...

1416
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,200
I did this?

1417
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,840
Sai! I can't believe you bent my drill head!

1418
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,960
Are they gonna fight among themselves?!

1419
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,320
Finally, your power has awakened!

1420
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,820
Your bloody, sweaty, tear-filled training has at last borne fruit!

1421
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Gramps?

1422
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,860
You did it!

1423
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,650
The Eight Impact Fist Secret Technique has found its successor!

1424
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,790
Sai, I'll bestow upon your kick...

1425
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,680
the name Drilling Dragon, Drilling Nail!

1426
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,700
I'm sure your leg can even break
the ice continent into pieces now.

1427
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,280
The Happou Navy is all yours now.

1428
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,140
I'll cancel your arranged marriage!

1429
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,380
You're free to do anything you please!

1430
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,020
The truth is, after the fight against Straw Hat,

1431
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,480
I've been suffering from chronic pain and I couldn't fight like I wanted.

1432
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,220
I'm getting older. I'm happy that you're now-

1433
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,880
Seal of G!

1434
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,720
Gramps!

1435
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,960
Lao G-sama!

1436
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,660
Lao G-sama took down Don Chinjao!

1437
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,700
Geo-Fist's ultimate technique!

1438
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,800
Battle Insurance Fist!

1439
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,160
In preparation for illness, injury, or aging,

1440
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,640
you reserve your muscle power from your earlier years and save it.

1441
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,040
It's a life-energy conservation technique!

1442
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,620
You'll have seasoned fighting skills as well as your power at its peak!

1443
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,780
Who can possibly defeat me?!

1444
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,300
Monkey from the Flower Kingdom, what do you want from me?

1445
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,480
I'll avenge Gramps,

1446
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,480
and repay my debt to Straw Hat and the others!

1447
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,740
Do you really believe that Straw Hat can take down the young master?!

1448
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
I do!

1449
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,900
Listen!

1450
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,840
Dressrosa belongs to the young master!

1451
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,400
And the people in this country are all...

1452
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,140
the young master's slaves!

1453
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:40,630
No matter how firmly you believe in Straw Hat, you will never escape from the bird cage!

1454
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,760
G, for bird cage!

1455
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,880
You're quick, I'll grant you that.

1456
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,220
But when it comes to Baby 5, I will not...

1457
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
let you have her!

1458
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,400
What?! Lao G!

1459
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,500
Just wait, Baby 5!

1460
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,610
G, for I'll kill this fool and stop him from taking you!

1461
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,450
What am I to do? They're fighting over me...

1462
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,260
It's dangerous! Stay away!

1463
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,120
A monkey is a monkey after all!

1464
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,200
If you used Baby 5 as a shield,
you could've had the upper hand!

1465
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,340
Baby 5 is ours!

1466
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,200
She'd even kill herself
if that's what she's needed for.

1467
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,160
Is there any other girl out there as convenient as she is?!

1468
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,100
Convenient?

1469
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,700
I'll send you to hell with this ultimate secret technique!

1470
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,840
Hey, how about this?

1471
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,880
That woman...

1472
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,860
If I defeat you, I'll take her as my wife!

1476
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Young master... I'm sorry!

1477
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,480
Damn you, unfledged monkey!

1478
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,490
G, for unfledged monkey!

1479
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,620
