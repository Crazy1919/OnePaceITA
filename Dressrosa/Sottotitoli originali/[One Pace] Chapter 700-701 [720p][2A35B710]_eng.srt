but no one is picking up!

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,340
I-I can't believe this!
We will lose the war without arms!

Doflamingo resigned from the Warlords of the Sea!

55
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,320
Why did he do that?!
Isn't there anymore information?!

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,720

I'm more concerned about the other news.

--He picked up!
--Picked up!

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,010
Doflamingo!?

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,190
He will hear you!

70
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,000
Hello? I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm gonna become the Pirate King!

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,400
I told you to shut up!

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,700
Hey, Mingo!

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,110
So you're that idiot Caesar's boss!?
That bastard hurt Brownbeard and the kids!

75
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,180
We will give you back Caesar as we promised but if you do that again,

76
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,520
I will beat the hell out of you!

77
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,800
Straw Hat Luffy.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,140
You went away for 2 years
after your brother died.

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,980
Where were you
and what were you doing?

80
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,360
I shouldn't tell anyone about it!

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,030
I wanted to see you.

82
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,340
What?

83
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,270
I have something
that you'll want very badly now.

84
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,540
H-Hey!

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,750
How delicious is that meat 
you're talking about?!

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,550
Straw Hat-ya!
Don't get drawn into his pace!

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,780
One chunk of meat! Two chunks of meat!

88
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,550
Luffy!

89
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,290
Keep yourself together!

90
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,490

This is a special attack called "His Pace"!

91
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,550
Joker! Cut the crap!

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,600
We'll hand Caesar over to you as we promised.

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,570
Well, that's for your own good.

94
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,700
If you try to run away with him,

95
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,270
you know what will happen to you guys.

96
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,240
Now, can I hear my precious
business partner's voice?

97
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,760
Joker! I'm sorry!

98
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,950
You resigned from the Warlords of the Sea for me!

99
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,620
8 hours from now,

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,900
at the beach on the southeast side of Green Bit,

101
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
the solitary island north of Dressrosa.

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,670
We will leave Caesar there
at 3 in the afternoon.

103
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,000
Go ahead and pick him up.
And this will all be finished.

104
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,140
That's too bad.
I wish I could have a drink with you...

105
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,590
Just hang up!

106
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,550
That was close.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,920
You almost got drawn into his pace.

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,490
Your eyes! Your eyes!

109
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,760
Hey, wait!

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,790

We didn't tell him how many men he can bring!

111
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,340
"How many men"?

112
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,900
What are we gonna do
if he brings his entire crew?!

113
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,940
It doesn't matter.

114
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,210
The handover of Caesar is a part of our plan. It's just to lure them.

115
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:43,070
You mean, destroying the SMILE factory while it's unguarded is our main purpose?

116
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,460
Yes, but we don't know where it is.

117
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,250
You're joking.

118
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,420
Don't worry!

119
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,530
Factories are big. You can barely miss them.

120
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,360
Once we get there, we'll super find it!

121
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,570
I will destroy it with my laser beam!

122
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,200
Big bro!

123
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,970
I have intelligence on
everything but the factory.

124
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,760
No wonder.

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,610
It's an important asset for them, isn't it?

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,030
Maybe there is a secret to it.

127
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,370
Law-dono!

128
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,620
You said you're going to
go to Green Bit earlier!

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,460
We will dock this ship at Dressrosa. Don't worry.

130
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,510
Tora-guy, have you been to that island?

131
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,460
Dress-roba!

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,230
{\an8}Roba: Old Lady

133
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,840
It's "rosa"!

134
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,700
I've never been there.

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,210
It's that bastard's kingdom.

136
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,420
Then, let's figure everything out once we get there!

137
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,960
It's gonna be an adventure!

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,220
Can't wait to see Dressrosa!

139
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,450
I wanna go to the Wano Country soon, too!

140
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't be ridiculous!

141
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,820
You can't just show up without a plan...

142
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,570
Sanji, I'm hungry!

143
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,530
What's for breakfast?

144
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,780
Sandwiches.

145
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah! I want a cotton-candy sandwich!

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,470
I'll just have a cup of tea.

147
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,850
I don't like bread!

148
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,580
I can't tell you why we were being chased.

149
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,580
But we set sail for the  place called Zou originally.

150
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,850
Zou?

151
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
Do you know it?

152
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,400
It's another coincidence.

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,600
After handing over Caesar
and destroying the SMILE factory,

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,060
I was gonna head for Zou.

155
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,120
My crew is there.

156
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,980
I-If so, can we go along with you there?

157
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,410
Yes, you can! Let's go there
and then the Wano Country!

158
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,390
Hey!

159
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,020
3 Samurai including me and Momonosuke...

160
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,300
4 of us headed for Zou.

161
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
but our ship wrecked...

162
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,970
and two of us Samurai and Momonosuke drifted to Dressrosa.

163
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,360
But we had been chased by
Doflamingo and the others there

164
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,740
and I ran into an unknown ship.

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,390
There, I met the children
who were looking to get treated.

166
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,800
And unfortunately, the ship left the port

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
before I knew it and headed for that island.

168
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,640
--Father!
--Oh no! Momonosuke!

169
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,250
I was gonna go after the ship...

170
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,960
and my fellow samurai Kanjuro tried to cover me but got caught!

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,270
Go after Momonosuke! Don't worry about me!

172
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,830
He let me sail out to the sea!

173
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,620
I have to save him!

174
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,950
I have to go back!

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,790
What a man, that Kanjuro!

176
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,200
Kanjuro!

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,640
Alright! I'm gonna go save him with you!

178
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,870
Guys! Don't forget our purpose!

179
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,590
New World

180
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,010
Near the Red Line

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,700
Navy Headquarters

182
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,270
{\an8}There are only seven Warlords of the Sea in the world!

183
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,730
They are the pirates who were chosen and given...

184
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,240
the carte blanche for robbery by the World Government

185
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,210
in exchange for their overwhelming strength and notorious prestige!

186
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,330
Them taking sides with the Government has to be...

187
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,440
seen as a threat to all 
other pirates in the world.

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
The greatest swordsman in the world...

189
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,160
Hawk-Eyes, Dracule Mihawk.

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,940
The king of Dressrosa and a charismatic devil...

191
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,140
The Heavenly Demon, Donquixote Doflamingo.

192
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,700
He is now the Navy's human weapon!

193
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,640
The Tyrant, Bartholomew Kuma.

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,980
The empress of Amazon Lily...

195
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,330
The Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock.

196
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,400
One of the Worst Generation
and the mastermind of the Rocky Port Incident...

197
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,860
The Surgeon of Death, Trafalgar Law!

198
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,210
The leader of the Pirate Dispatch Organization and a living legend...

199
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,850
The Thousand Piece Clown, Buggy!

200
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,620
And with the man I told you about earlier, they make up for the Seven Warlords.

201
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,030
But that all changed early this morning.

202
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,000
Doflamingo resigned out of the blue.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,400
And we might need to expel Law from the Warlords depending on his intention.

204
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,360
The third great power, that stands alongside Navy HQ and the Four Emperors, cannot remain this unstable.

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,110
Yes, I know, Brannew.

206
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,900
Fleet Admiral!

207
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,870
I'm not gonna let Law and
Straw Hat do whatever they want!

208
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,730
I got an annoying call from
Smoker of the G-5 yesterday.

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,480
Let's see how things go for today.

210
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,220
I've sent Fujitora!

211
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,220
{\an8}Fujitora: Wisteria Tiger

212
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,030
{\an8}Your Majesty!

213
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,290
Dressrosa

214
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,290
{\an8}Please don't quit!

215
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,920
Trébol-sama, where are you?!

216
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,370
Have you seen Trébol-sama?

217
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,290
No.

218
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,340
I wonder what Young 
Master-sama is going to do?!

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,100
If the Navy is gonna come to attack, I want to fight-in!

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,470
We will just follow the Young Master.

221
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,610
Oh, Baby 5!

222
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,010
What are you doing up there?!

223
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,550
Look! The whole kingdom is going crazy!

224
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm sure the whole world is getting upset!

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,830
Hey, hey!

226
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,980
By the way, did you get 
your fiancé killed again?

227
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,120
Too close!

228
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,070
Why do you keep asking me that?
You're so annoying!

229
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,600
Annoying but?

230
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,890
--Too close!

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,940
Annoying but what? Hmmm?

232
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,280
Annoying but you like me, maybe?

233
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,490
That's enough!
Young Master-sama was calling you!

234
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,470
He wanted you to bring that thing!

235
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,270
Stay away! You make me sick!

236
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,050
Hey, hey, hey!

237
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,990
You just keep getting your fiancé killed! Baby 5!

238
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,480
Stop choosing guys that will 
be killed by Doffy and marry me!

239
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,310
Hmm, just kidding!

240
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,810
Do you...

241
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,110
...need me?

242
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,250
Cut it out!

243
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,350
The Colosseum is always packed.

244
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,660
Thanks to you, Diamante.

245
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,420
What are you saying?

246
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,440
Doffy, that's because
you're a charismatic king.

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,800
No.

248
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,900
That's because you're strong.

249
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,740
Stop. You make it sound like
I'm the hero of the Colosseum.

250
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,750
You are the hero of the Colosseum.

251
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,690
Stop saying that.

252
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,260
Okay, I'll stop.

253
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,850
Alright, I admit it if you insist!

254
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,190
Yes, I am the hero of the Colosseum!

255
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,630
I brought it!

256
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,100
Doffy, it's that thing!

257
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,730
You're too close!

258
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,160
Too close, but...?

259
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,180
But I like it. Sit down.

260
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,740
If Straw Hat Luffy finds out about this,

261
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm sure he will try to get hold of it.

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,150
An alliance can sometimes prove a hindrance.

263
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,390
Diamante. I want to entrust this to you.

264
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,350
Wait a second, Doffy! I can't take it.

265
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,390
No, I want to entrust this to you.

266
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,880
Stop. You make it sound like
I'm some kind of genius.

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,870
I can only entrust this to a genius like you.

268
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,770
Stop saying that.

269
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,720
Okay, I'll stop.

270
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,760
Alright, I'll admit that I'm 
a genius if you insist!

271
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,300
Yes! I can take care of 
that dumb-ass Straw Hat!

272
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll be counting on you!

273
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,590
I know he will jump at it!

274
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,230
His older brother's power, the Flame Fruit.

275
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sure he wouldn't want 
anybody else to have it!

276
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,940
The island has come into view.

277
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,070
What is that rocky island?!

278
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,720
We made it! It's Dressrosa!

279
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,690
You idiot! Don't shout!
Doflamingo will hear us!

280
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,680
No, he won't!

281
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,990
We'll save you soon, Kanjuro!

282
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,700
This is a kingdom of love 
and passion - Dressrosa.

283
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,030
Shores of Dressrosa

284
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,390
We made it! Dressrosa!

285
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,460
I said you're too loud, Luffy!
We're in their territory now!

286
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,950
This week, I'm...

287
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,940
...super!

288
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,370
I'm gonna find the factory right away and ka-boom!

289
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,540
Hey! I just had a good idea!

290
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,750
Momo!

291
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,060
Fly!

292
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,100
You're too heavy! Get off of me!

293
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,760
I can't fly and I'm not 
gonna enter the island!

294
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,110
My father told me not to!

295
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,330
You can't fly?! What are you talking about?!

296
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,040
I saw you flying!

297
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,150
I don't know what you're talking about!
I said I can't!

298
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,100
I really saw him flying!

299
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,940
But he doesn't have wings.

300
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,060
See? I told you!
I don't remember flying!

301
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,000
E-Even if I did fly...

302
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,720
What's your name?

303
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,810
I-I'll never do such a dreadful thing again!

304
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,310
I'm not gonna fly in the sky!

305
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,420
Huh? Are you scared of heights?

306
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,320
You bastard!

307
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,480
Ouch!

308
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,190
Don't disrespect me!

309
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,730

We warriors don't get scared of anything!

310
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,810
Ow, ow, ow... You!

311
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,870
Stop it, you fool!

312
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,550
Luffy-san, he's an eight-year old...

313
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,370
Cut the "warrior" crap!

314
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm gonna become the Pirate King one day, you idiot!

315
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,330
I'm gonna become the shogun
of the Wano Country someday, you fool!

316
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,130
What did you say?! You eel!

317
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,870
You're so arrogant! You monkey!

318
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,600
Who did you call "monkey"?!
You're being rude to a monkey!

319
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,220
Enough, Momonosuke!

320
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,320
He saved us!

321
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm sorry, Luffy-dono. Please forgive him.

322
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,840
Even though he's a child,
he's a proud warrior of the Wano Country.

323
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,100
Having said that,

324
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,030
I can't believe you take an
8-year old so seriously!

325
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,030
I don't like cowards! Idiot!

326
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,010
You...

327
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,760
Dammit!

328
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,350
--Oh, Nami!
--Yes, yes! Momo-chan, come here!

329
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,290
That monkey is...

330
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,870
Get off her!

331
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,920
What's their problem?

332
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,830
Like father, like son!
I didn't know warriors were so sick!

333
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,930
H-How dare you say that!

334
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,600
Hey, Kin'emon! Let's go to the town already!

335
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,740
How should we change 
our clothes for a disguise?

336
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,180
Oh yeah!

337
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,460
This is how people dress in Dressrosa.

338
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,900
{\an8}For men, collared shirts

339
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,900
{\an8}For women, nothing

340
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,900
Let me change you all so you can fit in!

341
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,700
Dressrosa is the best!

342
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,670
Yeah!

343
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,200
Stop lying!

344
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,760
Hey.

345
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,260
I want you to keep this.

346
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,540
Is this a Vivre Card?

347
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,960
It'll point toward the island called Zou
that I talked about earlier.

348
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,420
If anything happens to us, go straight there!

349
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,670
W-What do you mean "Anything happens"?
Nothing will happen, right?

350
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,930
Who knows.

351
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,820
This is a map that my crewmate drew.

352
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,110
Wow! So terribly drawn!

353
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,580
We're here now, at the 
west coast of Dressrosa.

354
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,100
We, the Caesar Handover Team, will...

355
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,720
Current Location

356
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,470
...go across Dressrosa and
cross the very long bridge to north

357
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,070
and get to Green Bit.

358
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,150
Why do we have to go across Dressrosa?

359
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,530
We can just take the ship!
All of us together!

360
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,190
I heard it's impossible to travel by water.

361
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,260
Oh, that sounds interesting.

362
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,660
P-Please get me there safely!

363
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,190
And you all, the Sunny's Security Team,

364
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,570
should watch out for the enemy's attack.

365
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,030
Don't let them take the ship!

366
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,940
--What?! What do you mean by that?!

367
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,480
{\an8}Kanjuro... I hope he's still alive.

368
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,220
{\an8}What?! I thought guarding 
the ship was the safest!

369
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,290
{\an8}Guys, we're in the enemy's stronghold.

370
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,770
{\an8}But we're with Sanji so...

371
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,110
Huh?! Sanji's not here!

372
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,640
I mean, Luffy and the others are gone, too!

373
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,070
They're the key to this plan!
Where did they go?!

374
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,470
Hey! Who's gonna protect us?!

375
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,770
Visitors to this kingdom are fascinated by a number of things.

376
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,220
First, by the fragrantly-scented flowers

377
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,150
and the delicious smell of local food.

378
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,490
Smells good!

379
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,990
Second,

380
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,510
the tireless, passionate 
dancing of the local women.

381
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,820
Smells lovely!

382
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,610
And another thing...

383
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,540
Hey! Wait! Give it back!

384
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,130
Wait! Mario! Hey!

385
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,050
Give me my arm back!

386
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,520
Boy! You're a bad dog!
The cotton's gonna fall out!

387
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,410
Wait!

388
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,330
No!

389
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,360
I got a side stitch!
Although there's only cotton inside!

390
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,530
S-Stuffed toys?!

391
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,920
A shocking surprise for all visitors to this kingdom.

392
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,540
Hello!

393
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
I am a soldier!

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,710
Oh? Have we met before?

395
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,370
Your faces look familiar.

396
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,720
Oh, yeah!
You were in the paper this morning...

397
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,380
Ouch!

398
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,420
Oh no! The strings got tangled up! Help me!

399
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,790
What's this?! A toy?!

400
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,920
Everywhere you look,

401
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,770
blending in with the town...

402
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,890
and living side-by-side with humans.

403
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,170
They are living toys.

404
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,520
{\an8}This is a kingdom of love 
and passion and toys.

405
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,360
The port town - Acacia.

406
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,610
A man has been stabbed!

407
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,960
Oh, again?

408
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,650
What do you mean "Again"?

409
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,840
Is there a phantom slasher or something?

410
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,040
No. Women in this country are passionate about love and most are the jealous type.

411
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,110
So when a man cheats on a woman,

412
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,840
things can get pretty violent.

413
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,910
How scary!

414
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,350
The more beautiful they are, the more likely to stab a man!

415
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,930
Toys are moving by themselves but that's okay!

416
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,620
Let's eat!

417
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't have time to fool around like this!

418
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,700
I need to look for Kanjuro 
as soon as possible!

419
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,830
Whoa-whoa, relax.

420
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:29,780
I know we need to hurry but it's better to get some information rather than just run everywhere.

421
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,670
Isn't it strange?

422
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,890
Their king just abdicated from the throne this morning.

423
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,590
I thought there would be more confusion.

424
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,590
Maybe they don't know yet.

425
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,560
No way.

426
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,420
Let's ask. Hey, pops!

427
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,260
Don't!

428
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,720
What's your problem?!

429
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,440
You were on the front page of 
the newspaper this morning!

430
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,290
Here's your order.

431
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,160
Thank you for waiting...

432
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,180
...or not!

433
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,710
Here it comes!
I couldn't wait any longer!

434
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,220
Dress Shrimp Paella!

435
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,490
Rose Squid Ink Pasta!

436
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,860
And Fairy Pumpkin Gazpacho!

437
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,560
Everything looks yummy!

438
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,150
Let's eat!

439
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,100
Yum-yum!

440
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,570
What's "Fairy Pumpkin"?

441
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:33,110
Um, that's... In this country,
we still believe in a myth about fairies!

442
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,230
Or not!

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,410
Well, people claim to see fairies! Or not!

444
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,900
Seeing fairies?

445
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,440
Yes! Isn't it interesting?

446
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,570
For centuries!

447
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,960
Even though most of us haven't 
seen them, they do exist.

448
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,850
People call those fairies...

449
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,300
..."guardian deities of Dressrosa"!

450
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,710
Or not!

451
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,000
Ah, shut up!

452
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,100
He got it right again! Fourteen times in a row!

453
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,430
What's going on?
It's a little noisy back there.

454
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,790
It's a roulette game.

455
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,080
Okay, white!

456
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,950
Let's see.

457
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,490
How does it go? What is it?

458
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,750
You've missed it again. It's black 20!

459
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,630
It should be white this time!

460
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,370
It's black again!

461
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,860
That's awful!

462
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,470
They're a disgrace to Donquixote!

463
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,720
I guess I'm running out 
of luck. This is no good.

464
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
What do you wanna do? Do you wanna quit?

465
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,420
We can make a lot of money
when Buffalo-san isn't here.

466
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,840
No.

467
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,260
One last time.

468
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,190
I bet everything!

469
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,860
Great!

470
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,220
Then I'm gonna bet everything
on whichever color you don't pick.

471
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,320
Let's play it like real men!

472
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,340
Everything? Really?

473
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,210
Yeah.

474
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,580
Alright, let's do it.

475
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,750
Place your bets!

476
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,380
White, please!

477
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,690
If you pick white, I bet on black, of course!

478
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,700
Come on, white! White!

479
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,910
Which is it?

480
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,010
I'm sorry, old man!

481
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,090
--It's bl...
--White!

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,920
Ah?! Who the hell are you?!

483
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,900
Look carefully! It's black, idiot!

484
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,030
It's white.

485
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,200
Old man, you win!

486
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,930
What?!

487
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,390
You bastard! Stay out of it!

488
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,430
That's right!

489
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,100
Do you wanna get your ass kicked?!

490
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,390
Who is he?

491
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,840

Doesn't he have any idea who they are?!

492
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,310
He got himself involved, as usual!

493
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,730
D-Do I really win?!

494
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,730
Yeah, you win.

495
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,120
I don't know who you are
but thank you for your kindness!

496
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,800
Don't mention it. I just said what I saw.

497
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,050
I'm happy for you.

498
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,470
But, old man, you look so strong...

499
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,660
What you're doing is so senseless, you brat!

500
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,550
When we say "It's black," it's black!

501
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,380
He can't see anyway so it doesn't matter!

502
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,770
You're so annoying!

503
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,040
Go away!

504
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,250
Young man, could you step aside a little bit?

505
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,730
I'm going to send those people to hell.

506
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,990
It's heavy! So heavy...

507
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,390
I-I'm going to get crushed!

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,110
What?! What's wrong with him?!

509
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,540
What did he do?!

510
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,000
Wow! It left a hole!

511
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,050
It's not too bad being blind.

512
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:43,090
I know there are many hideous things
that are better unseen.
