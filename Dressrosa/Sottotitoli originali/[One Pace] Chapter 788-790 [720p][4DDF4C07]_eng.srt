Before Lucy comes to,
this country will be shred to pieces!

1165
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,380
We gotta do something about it ourselves!

1166
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,120
Take down Doflamingo, and the bird cage goes away!

1167
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,460
You really are dense.

1168
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,480
My message to you should be clear:
"Give me Straw Hat."

1169
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:26,000
Gatz-san, Lucy still needs more time to recover!
But I believe many people will die before that happens!

1170
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,040
I know! But I can't send
an incapacitated fighter into the ring!

1171
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,960
Whatever happens,
I won't give him up before he's recovered!

1172
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,430
Who's there?

1173
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,020
T... T-T-Trafalgar Law!

1174
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,520
The W-W-Warlo...

1175
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,450
You guys... don't you think you're running too much?

1176
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,740
Oh, that's because... Um...

1177
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,240
Will he regain his Haki?

1178
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,530
O-Oh, the thing is...

1179
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,530
He told me that he needed ten minutes,

1180
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,290
and now we've got three minutes and twenty seconds to go!

1181
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,330
No time to lose, then.

1182
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,830
I'll take care of him from here.

1183
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,540
Okay!

1184
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,930
{\an8}Less than three minutes remain
until the bird cage closes completely.

1185
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,430
Sevio

1186
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,520
Barrier!

1187
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,610
Now, let's do this, guys!

1188
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,360
My barrier will never break!

1189
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Push!

1190
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,990
Follow Zoro-senpai!

1191
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,630
King!

1192
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,880
All together now, and push!

1193
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,610
How strange.

1194
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,100
How can they exert that much power
with those injured bodies?

1195
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,400
Just a few minutes ago, they were burned out
and couldn't even stand up.

1196
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,650
What was all that fluff?

1197
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,950
They were Dandehealions.

1198
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,950
"Dandehealions"?

1199
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,740
That's right!

1200
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,040
They're dandelions made from Princess Mansherry's tears.

1201
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,900
Wait for me, wait for me!

1202
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Hurry up, or you'll get torn to shreds!

1203
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,910
Run faster!

1204
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,890
I can't, dammit!
I can't believe I twisted my ankle at a time like this!

1205
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,690
Hang in there!

1206
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,000
Huh?! I can run!

1207
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
He's way too fast! What's going on?!

1208
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,750
Dandehealion petals can miraculously heal people over a wide area.

1209
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,340
Princess Mansherry is worried about
what's happening to Dressrosa,

1210
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,590
and so she's shedding tears.

1211
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,630
I truly believe it will save many lives!

1212
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,930
So that's why those previously immobile fighters are...

1213
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,390
However, the drawback of this ability is...

1214
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,940
that it's only a temporary recovery, lasting for just a few minutes!

1215
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,490
It's unfortunate, but they'll revert to their
former state when time's up!

1216
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,820
So this is a last-ditch life support measure for our survival!

1217
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,530
The pain just suddenly left!

1218
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,450
I can run! I can escape!

1219
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,550
It's a miracle, doctor!

1220
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,380
The gods themselves must have descended to save our country!

1221
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Kabu-san...

1222
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,220
Yes, Princess Mansherry?

1223
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,400
This is how I fight!

1224
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,930
I don't know how to use weapons,

1225
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,930
and I can't bring down bad people, but...

1226
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,440
the tears won't stop!

1227
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Yes, it's very you!
An honorable way to fight!

1228
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,160
How in the...
The injured are recovering, one after another!

1229
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,500
Let's just get outta here!

1230
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,200
Hey, wait a minute!

1231
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,250
Heed my voice! {"epic" Usopp speech tiem}

1232
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,750
What is it, Hundredth-Degree Hack?!

1233
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,750
No, the guy behind him!

1234
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,380
It's the five-star, God Usopp!

1235
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,140
Just what kind of crime did he commit?!

1236
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,850
Alright, listen up, men!

1237
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,850
The strong among you need to go to the east and west sides of town!

1238
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,350
My friends are pushing back the bird cage in those places!

1239
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,020
Give 'em a hand!

1240
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Help them push back the bird cage?

1241
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,900
I don't think there's even a way to stop that thing!

1242
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,070
Yeah, there's no way!

1243
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,740
Quit making excuses! Believe in my friends!

1244
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,240
It's the wrath of God!

1245
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,830
We're on it!

1246
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,570
Run!

1247
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,870
Hurry up!

1248
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,870
Everybody, don't abandon hope!

1249
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,500
There are people who haven't yet given up!

1250
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,830
Come on, hurry up!

1251
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,210
Thank you, Rebecca!

1252
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,050
They're all trying so hard to stop the bird cage...

1253
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,820
But if this bird cage really is unstoppable,
all of their efforts will be wasted!

1254
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,210
I know I'm no match for him, but...

1255
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,540
But everybody's fighting at their hardest!

1256
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,550
I've got to do something, too!

1257
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,540
Father... If push comes to shove, I'll...

1258
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,880
kill Doflamingo!

1259
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Viola-san!

1260
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,070
Rebecca! Why are you here?!

1261
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,740
Viola-san, I...

1262
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,410
Don't do anything foolish!

1263
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,670
If I allow you to die, I won't be able to face Kyros, nor my late sister!

1264
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,750
So, what did you come to see me for, Viola?

1265
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,010
The Donquixote Family is about to be obliterated.

1266
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,600
If I do nothing to take responsibility as a
former commander, it would be too selfish of me.

1267
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,640
You can't!

1268
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,700
Either I die, or you die!

1269
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,950
Doffy!

1270
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,960
You're ever the passionate one, Violet.

1271
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,050
Town Center

1272
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,540
Hey, we've come all this way! Just let us through!

1273
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,050
The bird cage is right there!

1274
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,630
They say there's danger ahead,
and we can barely advance here as well!

1275
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,350
People all over the country arrived here
at the same time, so we can't even move!

1276
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,350
Smile Factory

1277
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,070
You gotta push more! Push harder!

1278
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,690
The bird cage will definitely stop! Just keep pushing!

1279
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,620
We got it!

1280
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Vicinity of the Smile Factory








At the Bird Cage

1281
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,330
How are we faring?

1282
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,840
It's slowing down... I think!

1283
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,430
Now that you mention it,
it does appear to be slowing down!

1284
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,170
Why are you here?!

1285
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,310
Oh my... I can't tell who's there, as I'm blind.

1286
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,120
Crap!

1287
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,480
It's hard to leave behind such a band of fools, is it not?

1288
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,640
Please allow me to assist in even the slightest capacity, despite my limited ability!

1289
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,810
Company, halt!

1290
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,190
Support those "unknown" people pushing the cage!

1291
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,410
Aye aye, sir!

1292
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,280
The Navy?!

1293
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,490
Oh, quite the aid!

1294
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,280
This is encouraging!

1295
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,290
Those of you unable to use Haki, head for the factory!

1296
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,040
Aye aye, sir!

1297
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,340
The Navy?!

1298
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,880
Push the bird cage back!

1299
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,470
R-Run for it!

1300
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,390
Hey, what're you doing?!

1301
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,180
Nothing'll change if we just keep running!

1302
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,810
I'm gonna push, too!

1303
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,450
H-Hey!

1304
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,150
Push!

1305
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,900
Oh, dammit, I'll push, too!

1306
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm no weakling!

1307
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,910
Yeah, that's the spirit!

1308
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,320
Me neither!

1309
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,830
We're gonna push, too!

1310
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,330
We wanna defend our own country!

1311
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,160
Push it, all together now!

1312
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,290
Alright, you guys!
Give it everything you've got!

1313
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,890
Yeah!

1314
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,880
Sevio

1315
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
There they are!

1316
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,260
Warriors, let us push too!

1317
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,770
Get pushing already!

1318
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,700
Yeah!

1319
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,020
Us, too!

1320
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,980
We can't just let it cut us without doing anything!

1321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Thank you all! I'm counting on you!

1322
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah, let's work together!

1323
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,000
Here we go, guys!

1324
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,070
Yeah!

1325
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,470
Let's go!

1326
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah!

1327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,620
Push!

1328
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,700
It's moving again!

1329
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,540
But it did stop for a moment.

1330
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,090
So it's stoppable!
Zoro-senpai is as awesome as ever!

1331
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,090
Keep pushing! Let's stall the shutting of the bird cage!

1332
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,000
Stay focused!

1333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,760
Hold on! Put more into it!

1334
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,680
What... Your Majesty? Army Commander Tank?

1335
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,390
Well done!

1336
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,940
If it weren't for you all,
we would've lost thousands already!

1337
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,280
Screw this bird cage!

1338
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,070
People are meant to be free! Keep pushing!

1339
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,740
Yes, sir!

1340
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,290
More!

1341
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,000
Yes, sir!

1342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Push the bird cage back!

1343
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,670
That's enough, Viola-san!

1344
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,810
Viola-san!

1345
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,690
A decade...

1346
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:51,700
Did you really think I would hesitate just because
we spent all that time together as a Family, Violet?

1347
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,740
That I would hesitate to kill you?

1348
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,750
I don't criticize my associates
for their mistakes.

1349
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,430
However, I don't condone betrayal.

1350
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,610
And now, next up is...

1351
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,790
Look at her, Violet!

1352
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,750
Rebecca!

1353
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,340
Viola-san... I can't control my body...

1354
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,270
Poor girl. She's so scared.

1355
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,100
You can't!

1356
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,410
Now, right this way!

1357
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,510
Stop it! Don't involve Rebecca!

1358
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,540
What am I... doing?!

1359
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,660
Viola-san!

1360
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,170
Rebecca!

1361
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,210
No! I don't wanna do this!

1362
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,840
Now, kill her.

1363
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,770
Viola-san!

1364
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,770
Why am I doing this?!

1365
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,280
Rebecca!

1366
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't wanna do this!

1367
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,000
Viola-san!

1368
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,670
It's starting to slice up the old Royal Grounds!

1369
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,670
Damn! It stopped once!

1370
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,840
If it keeps closing in,
people will start dying one after another!

1371
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Don't give up! Keep pushing!

1372
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,430
Stall it even for a second!

1373
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,600
How long till Lucy's back up?

1374
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,100
Uh, let me see...

1375
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,350
{\an8}Time until the slowed bird cage closes completely:

1376
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,510
{\an8}sixty seconds.

1377
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,990
{\an8}Time remaining until Lucy's comeback:

1378
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,300
{\an8}sixty seconds.

1379
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,670
It stopped once!

1380
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,170
We can keep on holding it back!

1381
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,720
Stop the cage!

1382
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,480
Stand strong and hang in there!

1383
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
Shut up! You're distracting us!

1384
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,510
Let's make this the greatest thing we've ever done!

1385
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,550
Please... Please be safe...

1386
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,050
As many lives as possible...

1387
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,100
Alright, everyone!

1388
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,220
It won't be much longer!

1389
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,280
Wh-Who's talking?

1390
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,620
Who is that? Now isn't the time!

1391
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,720
Where is he shouting from?

1392
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,540
Our star shall return!

1393
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,130
Oh, hey!

1394
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,630
There he is!

1395
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,930
You're the announcer from the Colosseum, Gatz!

1396
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,180
When did you get up there?

1397
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,350
And what are you up to?

1398
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,770
Everyone, have you forgotten?

1399
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,890
Now isn't the time to fool around!

1400
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Our country is on the verge of destruction!

1401
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,320
You aren't the king!

1402
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,030
No, of course you haven't forgotten!

1403
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,290
That funny, bold star who burst onto the scene...

1404
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,290
in the tournament at the Corrida Colosseum today!

1405
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,510
Star?!

1406
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,670
Don't tell me he's talking about...

1407
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,820
...me! {na fam lel}

1408
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,730
Well, I told you I'd stay here with you, but would you mind if I departed?

1409
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,850
Trafal...

1410
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,860
Gah! Law! He's gone!

1411
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
What... where did he go?!

1412
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,070
I have not forgotten.

1413
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,910
He tamed the killer bull feared by all,

1414
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,000
and toppled the towering Giant!

1415
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,210
He even knocked out the living legend, Don Chinjao!

1416
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,470
The little gladiator who made the Colosseum...
nay, the whole of Dressrosa burst with excitement!

1417
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,720
Never before have I seen anyone fight so freely,

1418
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,060
and make a competition as thrilling as he did!

1419
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,020
I was there watching it!
He's talking about that guy, isn't he?

1420
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,570
I saw him at the Colosseum!

1421
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,030
I watched it on a screen in town!

1422
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,530
And his name is...

1423
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,500
Lucy!

1424
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,500
So what? He's just some gladiator!

1425
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,750
Lucy...

1426
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,130
Help me, Lucy...

1427
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,640
That's right! It's Lucy!

1428
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,760
But that was just an alias!

1429
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,270
His real name is...

1430
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,530
The pirate, Straw Hat...

1431
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,570
Luffy!

1432
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,030
Wha... that's who Lucy was under his mask?

1433
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,080
Since we've been fooled by
and been under the control of a pirate,

1434
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
it's probably difficult for us to trust another pirate!

1435
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,080
However...

1436
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,920
He's different from the Donquixote Family, who appeared disguised as heroes,

1437
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,420
on that night a decade ago!

1438
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
Straw Hat Luffy is the man that our true king,

1439
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,220
King Riku, called our "hope"!

1440
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,940
Right now, he's knocked out after being wounded in battle, but...

1441
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,940
It's not over yet!

1442
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,080
Tremble with joy, Dressrosa!

1443
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,620
Lucy...

1444
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,630
swore this to me!

1445
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,170
Doflamingo will... {dramatic proresu pause}

1446
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,940
...be KOed in a single blow!

1447
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,070
He's got a hell of a big mouth!

1448
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,160
You've gotta do it...
We can't hold out much longer, Luffy!

1449
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,250
Amazing!

1450
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,750
Lucy!

1451
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,130
Are you listening,

1452
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,000
Doflamingo?!

1453
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,380
You...

1454
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,200
used our king as a puppet, deceived the world,

1455
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,470
and lived here in Dressrosa as a false king!

1456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,690
This will be your...

1457
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,940
execution stand!

1458
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,570
Gatz...

1459
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,490
I see everything you're up to, Doflamingo!

1460
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,040
If you want me, come and get me!

1461
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,830
Stay away from Viola-sama and Rebecca-sama!

1462
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,590
It won't be long before the star forged in the Colosseum,

1463
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,600
Lucy, comes back!

1464
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,100
Until that moment comes, hang in there!

1465
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,860
Luffy-senpai! Here we go!

1466
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,980
Hajrudin!

1467
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,600
What the...

1468
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,600
The injured who recovered earlier are collapsing again!

1469
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,380
Time's up.

1470
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,880
The effects of the Dandehealions on the initial recipients are wearing off.

1471
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,270
And it won't work twice in a row!

1472
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
All because I don't have the strength...

1473
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,000
I lifted them up for a moment,

1474
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,700
only to drop them right back down! I'm awful!

1475
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,160
No, Princess Mansherry.

1476
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,200
If it weren't for the Dandehealions, who knows how many people would have died from the bird cage!

1477
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,330
But...

1478
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,330
Look!

1479
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,630
You've created a miracle!

1480
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,710
Oh, please! What weaklings!

1481
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,600
People in the back take the places of the fallen! And bring more people!

1482
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,060
Yeah!

1483
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:47,000
We'll hold out no matter what,
until Lucy frees us from the bird cage!

1484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,770
Yeah!

1485
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,870
They've held out long enough.

1486
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,270
Luffyland will take over from there and rid us of the bird cage!

1487
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,160
And now the moment you've been waiting for...
Lucy will come back in ten seconds!

1488
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,040
He should be somewhere, listening! Call out our star's name!

1489
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,550
Lucy! Lucy!

1490
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:31,900
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1491
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,390
Three seconds to go!

1492
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
Two!

1493
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,200
Gatz-san!

1494
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,950
Lucy! Lucy!

1495
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,910
One!

1496
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,290
Ludicrous.

1497
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,800
Go to hell, Doflamingo!

1498
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,040
Our star Lucy's gonna...

1499
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,920
drop you with a single blow!

1500
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,970
Zero!

1501
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,950
Viola, it's your turn to be silenced.

1502
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,660
Forever.

1503
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,410
No!

1504
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,180
Viola-san!

1505
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,300
Close your eyes, Rebecca!

1506
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,140
You don't have to see a thing!
This is just a bad dream!

1507
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,140
No matter what happens, forget everything!

1508
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,270
I won't hold a grudge against you so...

1509
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,480
just forget about it, okay?

1510
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,080
No!

1511
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,930
It's not your fault at all!

1512
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,900
I'm so sorry, Rebecca!

1513
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,710
This will leave a deep scar in your heart!

1514
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,590
No!

1515
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,660
Go!

1516
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,670
He has come!

1517
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,800
Lucy!

1518
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,310
Lucy! Lucy!

1519
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,600
Straw Hat...

1520
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,490
A flashy comeback, I suppose.

1521
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,580
But you've barely managed to regain your Haki.

1522
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,380
You must barely be able to stand, no?

1523
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,930
That...

1524
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,220
goes for you too, right?!

1525
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,520
Lucy!

1526
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,950
Chambres!

1527
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,370
Rebecca!

1528
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,560
There you are.

1529
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,470
Well, watch closely, then...

1530
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,850
as your hope is crushed.

1531
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,700
Everwhite!

1532
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Th-The entire town's turned to strings!

1533
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,410
Lucy!

1534
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,370
Why, you...

1535
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,330
Futile.

1536
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,090
Thousand Arrows!

1537
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,180
Flapping...

1538
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,270
Thread!

1539
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,680
Armament!

1540
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,080
What's the matter?
I thought you were back at full strength?

1541
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,800
Have you really regained your Haki, Lucy?

1542
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
I-Is he gonna be okay?

1543
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,830
Lucy!

1544
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,300
That was pretty loud!

1545
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,050
It's too dusty to see clearly.

1546
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,630
Did Lucy win?

1547
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,550
The bird cage is still here!

1548
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,640
Hurry up, Lucy!

1549
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,440
Wh-What the...

1550
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,270
My body's moving on its own...

1551
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,450
I can't believe you're still alive!
Shall I impale you?

1552
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,710
Is that why you came running back?

1553
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,090
You made it out alive again, Luffy.

1554
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,630
Hmph! Next time I'll win!

1555
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,300
What happened to that Kong Gun you're so proud of?

1556
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,130
Well, it's like this, Rayleigh!

1557
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,300
This guy was way, way bigger than the other one...

1558
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,630
So it didn't work!

1559
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,730
That's quite the problem.

1560
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,900
But if the Kong Gun isn't working,
you have to come up with something else.

1561
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,500
Something else?

1562
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,580
Amusing, isn't it?

1563
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,400
Every single one of you...

1564
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,040
would have been better off staying in my cage and submitting to my manipulation.

1565
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Cage?

1566
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,590
Manipulation?

1567
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,550
Humans are mere scum.

1568
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,680
Enough, already!

1569
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,030
The Royal Plateau is getting cut!

1570
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,910
Hurry up, Luffy!

1571
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,380
Gonna do it again?

1572
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,510
If you turn into that Bound-Man of yours, I won't just have you kill your friends...

1573
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,720
but everyone in the country!

1574
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,300
Gear Fourth!

1575
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,330
The strings-!

1576
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,500
You've barely got any stamina left. How many seconds can you stay in that form?

1577
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,140
Lucy!

1578
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,020
He chose to fight me midair?

1579
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,400
He's got guts!

1580
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,490
Will I get to see how you're gonna "one-hit KO" me?!

1581
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,340
It's annoying to have you stand over me!

1582
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,400
You're always trying to chain down anything and everything...

1583
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,770
...and controlling and manipulating everybody!

1584
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,120
I feel like I'm suffocating!

1585
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,660
Blame your own birthright!

1586
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,160
All of you were born trash, fit only for manipulation!

1587
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
You humans are different from me!

1588
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,880
Shut up!

1589
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm gonna kick your ass and get outta here!

1590
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,230
Do your worst, brat!

1591
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,350
Spiderweb!

1592
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,400
But if the Kong Gun isn't working,
you have to come up with something else.

1593
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,400
Rubber...

1594
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,290
Something else?

1595
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,290
That's right.
Gear Fourth taxes your body far too much.

1596
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,000
You've got to think of something else.

1597
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,710
How about this, then?

1598
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,310
What?
That'll just make the problem even worse!

1599
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,320
King Kong...

1600
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,600
If you won't obey, I'll just kill you!

1601
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,540
Sixteen Holy Bullets!

1602
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,670
God Thread!

1603
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,850
...Gun!

1604
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,290
And in a certain land, there are people who call the Family of "D"...

1605
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,550
"the sworn enemy of the gods"!

1606
