Keep pushing forward!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070
Freedom is our only compass we need. -We are best friends-

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

There's power hidden in the bond between us,

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,650
With this fake grape made from tatababasco, we'll knock Sugar unconscious.{Yeah, I omitted the "world's spiciest"-thing here... But seriously, this line is entirely unnecessary anyway being that it's just repeating info}

Captain

32
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,180
What is it?

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,500
This is...

34
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,800
There was a fly.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,010
He shot down a fly.

36
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,280
I'll make sure Operation SOP succeeds.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,580
You may be able to hit a fly, but not me.

38
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,130
I'm too fast.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
He's so fast, I can't see him!

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,390
He might be able to do this.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,630
I'll have you return our captured comrades.

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,520
Go for it, Leo!

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,940
I know you can do it!

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,240
Please, make it.

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,410
Wait, Leo!{Isis: changed the style to thoughts, since I don't think she said that outloud and it's the same as all those previous lines were. checked the manga and confirmed it was a thought}

46
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,380
Robiland?{Isis: same as the previous line}

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,350
The Underground Trade Port

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,050
We haven't gotten any new workers this past year.

49
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,720
I know.

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,430
Shing Flower
"Elegant Sunflower"

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,290
They haven't shown themselves in the palace either.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Who's slacking off?!

53
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,640
Artificial Devil Fruit
Smile Factory

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,640
I-I wasn't slacking!

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,380
They must have noticed that five hundred of their people have gone missing.

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,680
Yet they never see the bad in people. The Tontattans sure are dense...

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,000
I mean, pure-hearted.

58
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,480
Then why aren't they showing themselves?

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,170
Who knows.

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,670
Well, if we can't get any new workers, we'll just
have to make the most of the five hundred we have.

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,330
Get moving! Whip of Love!

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,180
Hey!

63
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,390
These Smiles aren't ripe yet!

64
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Are you alright?

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,710
I thought you Tontattans could grow any plant.

66
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,720
W-Well yes, but the Smiles aren't natural...

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,120
No excuses!

68
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,500
Please let my brother take a break.

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,140
The food today was spoiled, so he...

70
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,030
You're complaining about the food too now?!

71
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't you want to cure your ailing Princess Mansherry?

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,480
W-We do!

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Then keep producing Smiles!

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,440
They're essential for the medicine that can cure her.

75
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,250
Less than ten percent of the crops you produce each season are usable.

76
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,750
Work harder and make the process more effective!

77
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,250
Could you let us see Princess Mansherry?

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,060
No.

79
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,360
Why?

80
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,860
If you catch her disease...

81
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,580
... it'd make us all cry!

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,570
You Tontattans are our invaluable partners!

83
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,480
S-Sanshita-san!

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,240
We'll do everything we can!

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,970
Please look after our princess!

86
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,460
Of course!

87
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,590
How can they believe such a blatant lie? {Swashy: This seems to be a thought and not use the Main style.}

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,660
W-What are you doing, Robiland?!

89
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm sorry. But if you'd just charged in like that, you would have been killed. {2x you'd -Fadeout4}

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,690
I looked at that fly's corpse.

91
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,500
He hit it perfectly between the eyes, despite its size. {Swashy-B: Changed the "He'd". Should just be "He".}

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,350
Trébol's dynamic visual acuity{lol taking the translation Google Translate gave me and using it verbatim -Starfish} is exceptional. {Swashy: Kinda goes with Robin's intellect. I'm in favor of keeping this or changing it to 'acuteness'.} {How about "spacial awareness"? -Fadeout4}

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,640
It's far too dangerous to go after Sugar while he's still guarding her.

94
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,120
So what are you going to do, Robiland?

95
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,960
Over here.

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,810
Hey, what's with this crate?!

97
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,900
It's a swarm of pink bees!

98
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,780
I have news, Trébol-sama!

99
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,180
There's a commotion in port four from Captain Eves' crew. {Xemnas: Since this is a trading port I felt this was more appropriate. Although it may need some rewording.} {Swashy-B: This was the best I can do. I think it sounds better}

100
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,650
They're demanding to talk to a commander about the deal.

101
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,600
They must be really brave
if they're not scared of Joker's name.

102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,540
Hey, did the guard change?

103
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,470
The usual guard is out for lunch right now!

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,540
This is an emergency!

105
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Several of our people have been injured!

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,210
Please help us!

107
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,520
Injured? I'm coming.

108
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,690
Hey, hey!

109
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,380
Trébol-sama! You're outside?

110
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,890
Strengthen the security on the four doors to the Commanders' Tower.

111
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,890
Yes, Sir!

112
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,340
And inform me right away if something happens.

113
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,350
Uh... Yes, Sir!

114
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,800
Trébol-sama!

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,310
We appreciate your hard work!

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,980
Hey, hey!

117
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,360
Where is it? Where's the fight?

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,290
Port four. {Xemnas: Since this is a trading port I felt this was more appropriate. Although it may need some rewording.}

119
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,820
What? You won't fight, Usoland?

120
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,690
It would be easy for me to handle this, but...

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,430
Doing nothing can't harm me.

122
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,600
... by watching over you, I will give you confidence!

123
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,170
Confidence?

124
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,640
Don't worry! If anything goes wrong, I'll save you!

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,540
That's so reassuring.

126
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,340
Who's there?

127
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,270
Give up, Sugar!

128
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,090
We've come to retrieve our comrades being held in the factory!

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,060
And we'll knock you unconscious!

130
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,930
Unconscious?

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,540
I don't know anything about your comrades.

132
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,210
What?!

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,440
Really?

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,090
What?!

135
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,760
Really.

136
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,910
Okay then.

137
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,980
It's not okay! Don't let her trick you!

138
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,380
T-That was close! Give back our comrades!

139
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,400
Who told you all this? You're clearly too dumb to realize that you're being tricked.

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,130
I had been wondering why the Tontattans
haven't been seen in the palace for the past year.

141
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,030
So it was because someone has been deceiving you.

142
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,840
Silence!

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,000
Hold her down and force her mouth open!

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,340
How insulting. It feels like
you're underestimating me...

145
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,690
Little Black Bears!

146
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,490
Time to make the contract.

147
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,300
Oh no! She turned us into toys!

148
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,200
Obey my orders until you die.

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,410
Have we all been forgotten?! {Uh, haven't they said that EVERYONE forgets the people who turn into toys? In that case, what's with all this "we"-stuff? You shouldn't even be aware that there WERE others charging alongside you just now. -Starfish}

150
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,760
What?

151
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,220
A bunch of toys showed up out of nowhere.

152
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,400
What were we just doing?

153
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,650
Slaughter all the intruders in the Commanders' Tower!

154
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,950
I can't resist her orders!

155
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,160
Slaughter all of them... Even me?!

156
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,030
Don't! I don't want to fight!

157
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,860
Those must be Sugar's subordinates!

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,500
I can't believe she had more backup aside from Trébol!

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,610
Leo! It's me, Flapper!

160
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,070
Take down the enemy soldiers!

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,900
No! No! No!

162
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,650
Nooo!

163
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,220
Trébol, come back! It's a trap!

164
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Trébol!

165
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,630
A trap?

166
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,330
Hey, you!

167
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,830
Look at that, Trébol-sama!

168
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,130
The pirates are causing a commotion. We can't deal with them!

169
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,640
Hey, hey, you! {Swashy-B: So I put a comma here because it's correct but it just doesn't look right. Someone double check this please.}

170
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,940
What's the problem?

171
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,610
Trébol-sama!

172
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,280
Hey, what's up?

173
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,950
Well, it's not really a problem...
Just, a bunch of bees that were in the cargo.

174
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,460
There's no problem with the deal.

175
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,290
That woman!

176
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,860
Hey, hey, wait, wait!

177
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,370
You!

178
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,970
Hey, who are you? Hey!

179
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,050
She disappeared! Hey! Hey!{OH FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, *SHUT THE FUCK UP*. -Starfish}

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,040
But wait... That face...

181
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,770
Was she one of the Straw Hats?!

182
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,410
How'd she get here?

183
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,690
Trébol!

184
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,600
Why are they after Sugar?

185
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,660
Get back here! You've been tricked!

186
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,820
Die, you imbecile!

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,900
Now I'm mad!

188
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,740
Sticky Chain! {TL note? -Fadeout4}

189
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,130
Sticky Stick...{should this be "sticky stick" or "sticky sticky"? -Kae}{Xemnas: I prefer" Sticky stick".}

190
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,550
Meteor!

191
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,380
T-Trébol-sama has gone mad!

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,950
The Commander's Tower has been crushed!

193
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,720
Usopp, Usopp, get a hold of yourself.

194
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,350
Thank goodness.

195
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,860
Rob-

196
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,360
W-What happened?

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,790
A duck suddenly fell from the ceiling.

198
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,130
Leo and the others have been captured.

199
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,450
There are others, as well, right?

200
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,170
Right, right?

201
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,570
What are their names?

202
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,900
I'll never talk!

203
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,650
That's right, don't tell them!

204
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,840
Let's get out of here while we can, Robin.

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,450
See, the other guy is my friend.

206
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,150
I think his name was...

207
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,720
Oh, you mean Usoland?

208
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,650
Hey!

209
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,830
You idiot, he's not my friend.

210
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,390
Dammit, you tricked me.

211
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,000
Is the one-legged soldier one of your people too?

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,520
I-I won't talk.

213
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,170
We already know.

214
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,240
If you already know then there's no point in hiding it.

215
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,650
He's our comrade.

216
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,390
I knew it.

217
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,470
Dammit.

218
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm starting to connect all the dots.

219
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,950
Even if you figure it all out, it's over for you.

220
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,930
We will get our friends back!

221
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,160
That sticky stuff is also combustible.

222
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,890
What's going on now!?

223
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,750
Trébol-sama!

224
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,620
Leo, Leo!

225
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,010
Let's get out...

226
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,960
I mean, you have to get out of here.

227
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,300
You guys can't go any further.

228
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,670
You don't stand a chance against Trébol.

229
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,110
We... can't do that.

230
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:40,520
I must... hurry and complete... Operation SOP...

231
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,990
And then the captain will...

232
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,000
beat Doflamingo for us.

233
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,440
The captain is waiting for us!

234
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,010
I have to hurry.

235
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,650
The Royal Palace,
1F Lift

236
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,430
Captain!

237
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,600
This morning
in Dressrosa.

238
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,600
Doflamingo-sama is stepping down as a Warlord?

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,040
Is he going to abdicate as well?

240
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,000
He's just a pirate now!

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,960
Now he'll be hunted by the Navy!

242
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,920
We're gonna be free!

243
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,530
Captain, did you see the newspaper?

244
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,260
Now our comrades will come back, right?

245
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,780
We won't have to fight after all!

246
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,410
What a relie-

247
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,800
No, it was a false report.

248
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,640
No way!

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,380
I'm so glad it was a mistake!

250
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,570
There's no way someone as great as him would just leave the throne.

251
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,190
Doflamingo-sama!

252
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm gonna enter today's tournament and get the Mera Mera Fruit.

253
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,130
And then I'm gonna kill Doflamingo!

254
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,890
Rebecca, keep calm.

255
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,130
I understand your anger.

256
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,050
I feel the same way...

257
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,040
but don't do anything rash.

258
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,970
We will be the ones to fight.

259
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,810
Everything's prepared.

260
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,680
No, I won't wait!

261
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,510
We've been plunged from heaven to hell.

262
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,750
Everyone's at their limits.

263
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,780
Their wills have been broken!

264
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,180
Can we merely await the day of our execution?

265
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,170
If you win a thousand matches you can be set free?

266
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,330
That isn't even hope!

267
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,720
It's a wall of despair!

268
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,160
The legendary gladiator with three thousand wins, Kyros?

269
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,640
Everyone knows that statue is a lie.{Is the "bronze"-part really necessary here? I mean yeah, it is in the Japanese line, but is that really such an essential detail that taking it out would hurt the story? No, I think not. -Starfish}

270
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,980
Kyros is some ideal warrior the dying prisoners dreamt up.

271
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,680
A statue full of wishes that they
can succeed and get out of here.

272
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,980
Rather than putting my hopes in a stupid dream,

273
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,290
I'll take a chance on today's tournament!{Copy pasted from 657, changed slightly since there's more context}

274
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,690
As if there's a chance!

275
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,100
You can't possibly win. {Copy Paste from 657}

276
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,710
You'll just be throwing your life away! I refuse to let you enter!

277
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,370
You're so hot-headed!

278
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,440
You're only sixteen!

279
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,460
Do you think yourself an adult, Rebecca?!

280
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,800
You're still a child!

281
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,380
Listen to what I say!

282
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,180
Quit talking like you're my father!

283
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,070
You're the one getting heated up.

284
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,620
What plan?!

285
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,580
There's no way you can beat Doflamingo!

286
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,060
You're just a one-legged toy!

287
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,560
Indeed...

288
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,560
You're right. {if somebody wants to split this, that would be cool. -Kae} {Split by Donfong}

289
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,610
No, wait!

290
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,140
I may have said too much.

291
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,280
But please, don't enter.

292
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
I didn't mean it.

293
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,480
Soldier-san, wait!

294
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,920
Wait! Soldier-san!

295
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,950
I was afraid that you'd die and got scared!

296
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,010
I'm sorry!

297
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,380
Wait, Soldier-san!

298
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,410
Soldier-san!

299
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,450
Oh my!

300
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,090
Rebecca, who has never initiated an attack, has begun attacking!

301
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,960
What's with that sword?

302
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,500
There's no edge.

303
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,070
This is an arena for killing.

304
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,910
If you're not gonna cut someone, then get cut yourself.

305
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,570
That'll get the audience riled up.

306
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,590
Lock!

307
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,190
A direct hit!

308
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,100
The undefeated woman was completely helpless!

309
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,970
Diamante!

310
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,400
Dammit!

311
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,710
Hey, Musclemelon!

312
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,520
It's Bartolomeo.

313
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,040
Protect that girl.

314
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,050
Rebecca, do you know how your mother Scarlett died?

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,220
I'll go get us something to eat. {Copy paste from ep 651}

316
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,660
The way that toy soldier was crying was truly pathetic.

317
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,350
I'm sorry, {copy paste from 651}

318
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,440
I couldn't protect your mother! {end copy paste}

319
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
Royal Palace 1F
Outside the lift

320
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,740
These tremors...

321
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,390
It must be Pica.

322
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,180
Why is he thrashing about?

323
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,410
We won't let you follow them!

324
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,780
Are you okay, Captain?

325
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,290
T-Thanks.

326
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,560
We have to hurry.

327
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,100
Wait, they'll die!

328
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,200
Let go of me, you damn gnomes!

329
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,150
Look ahead, captain!

330
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,280
We were prepared for it from the start.

331
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,370
Don't be stupid!

332
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,680
If you don't make it then what's gonna happen?

333
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:23,550
Even if Leo and the others complete Operation SOP, if we don't beat Doflamingo, nothing will change!

334
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,490
You're the only one who can kill Doflamingo, Captain!

335
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,870
Underground Trading Port
The Officers' Tower

336
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,760
Who's your captain, Leo?

337
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,870
Why are you betting everything on him?

338
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,070
It's just a one-legged toy!

339
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:50,880
When new toys are turned, they are bound
by a contract that blocks their will to resist.

340
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,340
Huh? What's that?!

341
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,410
But in the case of our captain, the first toy who was ever created in this country...

342
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:04,180
Sugar made the mistake of
not forcing a contract on him.

343
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:17,200
Due to that single mistake ten years ago, he is the only toy able to defy the Donquixote Family.

344
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:27,420
That's why the captain has been fighting on his own for ten years.

345
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,090
If it weren't for him, the toys could only cry themselves to sleep.

346
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,060
We Tontattans wouldn't have noticed a thing.

347
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,840
We'd have all been turned into their slaves.

348
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,280
If we ignore his screams, then there's no saving this country!

349
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,190
He is worth betting everything on!

350
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,110
No one remembers him now...

351
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,620
but long ago, everyone knew his name.

352
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,300
Back when he was a big human, his name was...

353
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,510
Kyros!

354
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,520
The strongest gladiator in the Colosseum's history!

355
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,550
He is our captain!
