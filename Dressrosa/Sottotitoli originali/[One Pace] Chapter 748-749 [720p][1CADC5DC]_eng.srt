Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

13
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070
Freedom is our only compass we need. -We are best friends-

15
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,580
We'll be the ones to carve out our own route.

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,000
We spend all our days moving full speed ahead, -Go east, Go west-

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,410
each day brings something new and we leave nothing unfinished.

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,200
Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,050
Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,920
A chain of excitements!

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,490
That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,230
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,700
and head for your goal, that's what adventure is all about!

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Let's go shining! Running! Forever!

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Spread open the chart of your dreams!

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,170
There's power hidden in the bond between us,

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

30
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,240
Onward!! Army of Rogues

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,110
Hey, stop it, Straw Hat!

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,700
Pica-sama is very sensitive about his voice!

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,050
If he loses his cool when he's in that form...

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,090
Run!

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,000
You can't even call that a punch!
The whole town's coming down on us!

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm sensing something really awful here.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,310
Isshou-san, you have to get out of here!
It's a stone giant!

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,880
Luffy, will you stop provoking the enemy already?!

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,510
See? You're laughing too!

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,920
You two...

41
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,790
Here it comes! {Halee: Custom infobox up next.}

42
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,230
Where are we?

43
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,070
"Plaza" Outside of
the Colosseum

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,070
Dunno.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,310
It seems we're pretty far away from the palace.

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,480
Damn that rock-merging man.

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,880
He's even bigger than Oars.

48
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,950
If only I knew how to beat him.

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,450
Straw Hat...

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
Cabbage!

51
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,800
Pirate Hunter Zoro...

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
And Trafalgar...

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Law!

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Give me back my...

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,510
popularity, you damn Worst Generation!

56
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,520
What are you doing?!

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,440
He's part of my crew now!

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
Like hell I am!

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
What, do you still hate me?

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,720
No, I won't target the Straw Hat Pirates anymore.

61
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,430
Because my life was saved by your crewmate, God Usopp.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,330
Yes, I will never forget his bravery as he disregarded himself to save many people.

63
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,940
Even though I didn't see it.

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,640
I love hearing nice things about my crew.

65
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,470
Ah yes...

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,980
Trafalgar, this is your hat, is it not?

67
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,220
I found it in front of the Colosseum.

68
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,420
Allow me to put it back on.

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,790
Now, step forward.

70
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,020
Like I'd trust you!

71
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,390
Well, whatever...

72
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,430
I'm quite busy right now.

73
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,030
In order to repay you all, I've decided to kill Doflamingo.

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,940
What?!

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,740
Leave it all to me.

76
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,340
You lot should go hide somewh-

77
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,840
Don't bother. I'm gonna do it.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,750
I have to repay my debt to Rebecca for buying me lunch.

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,580
You're fighting because of food?!

80
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,920
As if! Don't lie to me.

81
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,660
You want to beat Doflamingo and gain even more popularity, right?!

82
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,290
What popularity?!

83
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,530
Just think about it.

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,870
If I defeat a pirate as evil as Doflamingo, the reporters won't leave me alone!

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,240
Mornings would begin with a rush of interviews.

86
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,810
"Good day, superstar."

87
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,810
"I'm honored to be called a superstar, so what can I do for you?"

88
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,880
"Cavendish-san, could you give us a few words about your pirate life in recent years?"

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,720
"Ah, are you still there, Cavendish-san?"

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,630
"What's wrong, I'm right in front of you."

91
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,730
"Is that so?"

92
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,730
"It's so bright that I can't see you!"

93
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,600
"Is it too bright? I'm sorry, but I just can't hide this sparkle of mine!"

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,070
"Amazing, you're really a star!"

95
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,540
Alrighty, let's go.

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,680
"Now, burn it into your eyes! I'm a superstar!"

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Where is he?

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,090
Find him!

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,530
We can't find Straw Hat's corpse!

100
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,230
He was either smashed to bits or sent flying off somewhere.

101
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Find him!

102
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,920
If he's still alive, let me know!

103
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,790
I won't let you get to Doffy!

104
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,390
So this is where you were hiding, Straw Hat.

105
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,990
Out of the way!

106
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,390
You're in the way!

107
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,320
Out of the way!

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,630
That voice...

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,640
Wait, grandson of Garp!

110
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,640
Happou Navy (Gang)
Don Chinjao

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,840
We've been looking for you, you bastard!

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,840
Happou Navy (Gang)
Leader, Sai

113
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,080
Happou Navy (Gang)
Second in Command, Boo

114
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,080
I won't let you get away!

115
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,580
I knew it!

116
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,950
Wait!

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,150
This is bad, let's run!

118
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,920
What's up with you!

119
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
Why do you run? {Xemnas: Yes I translated this awkwardly on purpose}

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,830
They just won't quit!

121
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,220
Wait!

122
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,670
Damn you're annoying!

123
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,370
Why do you not wait?!

124
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,670
Head-Armor!

125
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:47,810
Didn't you hear me, grandson of Garp? I told you to wait!

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Don't misunderstand my intentions, grandson of Garp.

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,330
My grudge against your family has long since disappeared.

128
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,930
Really?

129
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,470
We originally came here to destroy Doflamingo's business.

130
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,870
We don't give a shit about some bounty.

131
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,940
That chump change won't force us into action.

132
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,680
Yes, and I have decided that by beating Doflamingo to a pulp,

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,780
I can return the favor to you and God Usopp.

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,990
No, I'm gonna beat Doflamingo.

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
What?!

136
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,360
Are you trying to snub my good will?!

137
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,800
Warrior of Elbaf
Hajrudin

138
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,800
There you are, Straw Hat Luffy.

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,470
Let us forget what happened during our match.

140
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,210
On my pride as a warrior of Elbaf, I shall defeat Doflamingo and repay my debt to you.

141
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,410
My Prodence Kingdom is indebted to King Riku.

142
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,620
King of Prodence
Elizabello the Second

143
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,880
I shall be the one to defeat Doflamingo!

144
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,260
Strategist, Dagama

145
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,260
What he said, we have no interest in the bounty.

146
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,230
No, the ones to beat him will be us!

147
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,670
I shall never forget...

148
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:16,200
Jeet & Abdullah

149
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,930
the light from the heavens that God shone upon me!

150
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,200
Let us repent!

151
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,310
Wait up, I shall be the one to to defeat Doflamingo!

152
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,970
Fleet Admiral
Orlumbus

153
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,810
Destructive Cannon Ideo

154
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,810
Destruction shall be my method of repayment!

155
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,810
Beheader
Suleiman

156
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,810
His execution shall be left to me.

157
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,750
No, I'll be the one to kill Doflamingo!

158
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,750
Blue Gilly from the Long Leg Tribe

159
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,050
A lot of them have come out.

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,160
Don't forget about me!

161
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
Another annoying one is here.

162
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,200
Then what about this?

163
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,240
We'll beat up Doflamingo, and you guys can support us.

164
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,610
What are you on about, I'll defeat Doflamingo!

165
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,280
I said I'd be the one to do it!

166
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,690
It's no use.

167
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,050
These guys have too much pride.

168
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,990
You guys...

169
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,690
All of you, give it a rest!

170
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,330
I told you I'd be the one to beat Doflamingo!

171
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,070
What did you say?!

172
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,070
I told you we're repaying our debt.

173
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,510
If you keep spouting crap, I'll kill you, stupid benefactor!

174
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,480
That's right!

175
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,010
Honor!

176
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,280
Popularity!

177
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,480
Pride!

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,780
King Riku!

179
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
God!

180
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,960
A spear?!

181
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,560
We found them.

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,160
You guys give us a hand.

183
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,870
There's a two hundred million and two three hundred million bounties.

184
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,140
Those guys were the toys that were with us underground.

185
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,610
They have quite the gall!

186
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,540
Capture them!

187
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,210
Go to hell, you ungrateful bastards!

188
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,450
Let's go.

189
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,520
Yeah.

190
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,390
Ucy!

191
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,560
A bull?

192
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,790
I got an idea.

193
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,200
There's something in the smoke!

194
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,510
A-A bull?!

195
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,110
Go!

196
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,310
He's here!

197
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,170
Pica-sama, we've found him!

198
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,920
It's the Straw Hat Pirates!

199
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,620
They've returned here!

200
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,390
Don't let them get away!

201
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,620
They're riding a bull. It's those three from before.

202
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,070
And four, five, six... seven.

203
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,740
Wait, Straw Hat!

204
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,040
I told you all to stop following me!

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,840
Th-Their numbers... are increasing!

206
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,810
I'll be the one to kill Doflamingo!

207
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,600
Shut up!

208
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll take him out, even if I have to kill all of you to do it!

209
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,190
What are you talking about. I'll do it!

210
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,680
No, I will!

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,190
Why do they suddenly have more allies?!

212
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,180
How should I know!

213
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,460
They're all participants from the Colosseum!

214
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,900
Whether it's three or three hundred people, it makes no difference!

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,420
Here it comes!

216
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,360
Hasshoken Secret Technique!

217
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,200
Drill Dragon

218
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,760
It might not be fully charged...

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,050
Light version...

220
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,640
King Punch!

221
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,930
...Drilling Nail!

222
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,560
Pica-sama's hand!

223
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,400
At this rate we'll be the ones to defeat Doflamingo!

224
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,790
Stop following me already!

225
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Shut up, you damn savior!

226
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,670
What did you all say?!

227
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,050
All flash and no bang.

228
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,720
There is nothing my drilling head cannot break!

229
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,570
That was close!

230
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,120
Go, Ucy! To the palace!

231
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,910
Don't get squashed! I'm counting on you, Ucy!

232
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,790
Hey. Didn't I tell you to stay away?

233
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,010
Get off Ucy's back!

234
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,010
Please don't be that way.

235
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,920
Please, Straw Hat-san!

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Ucy, I'm counting on you!

237
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,880
Hey! Don't let them pass!

238
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,620
They're headed for the palace!

239
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll take you on!

240
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
Ideo, the King of Martial Arts?!

241
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,420
Don't let Straw Hat escape!

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,100
Don't get distracted.

243
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,380
Destructive Cannon!

244
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,100
Wanna stop me? Then bring in some stronger men!

245
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,410
What's with these guys?

246
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,880
A-Admiral Orlumbus!

247
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,280
This is my path!

248
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
Admiral...

249
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,170
Hug!

250
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,780
Now! Fire!

251
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,230
Beautiful Sword!

252
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,540
Swan Lake!

253
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,320
Look up!

254
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,200
Another punch is on the way!

255
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,280
He's so persistent!

256
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
Want another-?!

257
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,890
Drop it, you two!

258
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,600
He can restore his broken arms.

259
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,480
If you fight him without knowing his capabilities, you'll just waste your energy.

260
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,900
Then what should we do?

261
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,860
In that case...

262
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,480
Run!

263
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,920
And you call yourself a strategist?!  Come up with a better plan!

264
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Hush! Running is a perfectly viable strategy!

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,620
Get the hell out of here!

266
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,940
We can't go straight forward. Our only hope is to find a way around.

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,420
That guy is such a pain.

268
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,770
We can't reach the palace unless we stop him.

269
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,760
Hey, where did Straw Hat go?

270
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,370
I don't see him!

271
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,800
Was he crushed along with the buildings?!

272
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,300
There he is!

273
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,560
This is a shortcut! Alright!

274
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,700
He's on him?!

275
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,320
Go, Ucy!

276
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,230
What?!

277
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,880
Is he insane?!

278
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
Don't steal my thunder!

279
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,520
I don't believe it.

280
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,060
Now let's keep going to the palace!

281
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,050
Yeah! Go, Ucy!

282
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,930
Hey.

283
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,410
Yes?

284
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,760
Don't you "Go!" me!

285
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,280
Yes?

286
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,470
Get off! You're too heavy for Ucy!

287
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,220
Oh, of course.

288
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,160
Pardon the late introduction. I'm Jeet.

289
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,010
And the big guy behind me...

290
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,320
My name is Abdullah.

291
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,980
I didn't ask!

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,290
Straw Hat!

293
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,930
He's freaking pissed!

294
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,160
I won't let you get near Doffy!

295
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,940
His arm!

296
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,120
Straw Hat-san?!

297
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,670
Rubber...

298
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,220
Grizzly Magnum!

299
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,470
He did it!

300
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,880
He smashed him?!

301
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,400
Pica-sama!

302
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,760
He did it!

303
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,340
Awesome, Straw Hat-san!

304
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,560
Great job!

305
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,240
Alright, now let's hurry to the palace!

306
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,080
Luffy, the head you just smashed was nothing but stone!

307
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,050
Huh?!

308
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,060
We're just running on a statue now.

309
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,800
Did he disappear again?

310
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,080
His real body is right ahead!

311
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,140
Huh? That's the stone-guy?

312
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,460
First time I've seen him looking like a human being.

313
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,440
He's got a huge sword!

314
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,510
Dodge!

315
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,190
If you can't dodge him, then stop!

316
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,820
We won't make it!

317
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,420
The bull is flying?!

318
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,500
That voice is so funny!

319
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,460
Straw Hat!

320
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,590
Here he comes again!

321
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,910
We're going ahead!

322
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,470
What?

323
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,060
Sure!  I got this!

324
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,560
Amazing!

325
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,940
Get out of my way!

326
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,690
That's God's crew for you!

327
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,570
Zoro, I'm counting on you!

328
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,500
I'll go send Doflamingo flying!

329
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,400
Roger that, Captain.

330
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,700
I have unfinished business with Straw Hat. Move!

331
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,420
My captain has no business with a pebble like you.

332
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,640
You'll have to settle for me, you oversized soprano.

333
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,600
Hey, the monster stopped moving. Is he dead?

334
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,540
No, I doubt it.

335
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,400
But if it means his bothersome punches have stopped, then this is our chance!

336
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,920
I will take down Doflamingo!

337
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
No, I will!

338
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Alright!  Keep going, Ucy!

339
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,960
Yeah, do your best, bull!

340
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,730
Bull!

341
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,820
How long are you gonna hang around?! Get off!

342
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,460
Oh, stop it, Straw Hat-san!

343
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,200
Hey, Straw Hatter.

344
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,320
Huh?

345
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,530
I understand that we have no choice but to fight.

346
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,020
I've made up my mind.

347
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,950
The plan I first suggested was an indirect way to crush Doflamingo.

348
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,050
But to be honest, I, too, wanted to take him down directly.

349
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,880
I lost earlier, but this time I'll get him!

350
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,340
Thirteen years ago, someone very dear to me...

351
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,010
was killed by Doflamingo.

352
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,410
His name was Corazón.

353
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,560
He was a top commander in the Donquixote Family.

354
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,430
Huh?! He was one of Mingo's men?!

355
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,930
That's right.  I owe my life to him.

356
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,440
He was also...

357
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,840
Doflamingo's little brother!
