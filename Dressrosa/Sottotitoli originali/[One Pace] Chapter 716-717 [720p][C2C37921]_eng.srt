00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll find One Piece...

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,100
and become the Pirate King!

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,430
Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

37
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,250
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,350

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

The contenders are getting blown away like sheets of paper!

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,710
It's Kelly Funk who is punching them!

Ra-Ra-Ra Rampage!

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,850
I saw it! I know I did! What was that all about?!

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,360
The two became one!

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,780
Hurry up and wear me, Bobby!

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,230
Jacket Two-in-a-Coat!

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,510
Bobby was born with such a strong body, but it was wasted on him with his weak personality.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,920
However, when he puts me on as his "skin,"

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,930
I take over his personality!

58
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,720
I show my fighting skills and brutality at full with his body! {Halee: The "if" condition is never stated, or the sentence is worded poorly in these 4 last lines}

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,610
I'm a jacket human who ate the Jacket Fruit!

60
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,650
Whether it's an animal or a monster,

61
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,150
once someone puts me on,
I get control over all of him!

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,410
It was over before I knew it!

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Oh, you're the older of the brothers from the Flower Country!

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,080
I beat your brother in a second!

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,030
We brothers are working together and killing people for a living!

66
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,580
You're so pathetic!

67
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,530
You can't even save your own brother!

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,500
He lost because he trained himself poorly.

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,410
That's cruel.

70
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,040
Ra-Ra-Ra Rampage!

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,590
Isn't the martial art of the
Flower Country supposed to be strong?!

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,790
Huh?!

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,200
From the moment I became a disciple in the way of the Eight-Impact Fist,

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,910
I renounced all emotional attachment to my brother!

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,880
But...

76
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,100
as the 13th leader of the Happou Navy,

77
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,340
I will avenge my subordinate!

78
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,030
S...

79
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,240
So strong!

80
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,750
The Eight-Impact Fist!

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,050
Sai shows what it truly means to lead!

82
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,690
Nobody could stop the monster, Kelly,
but he took him down with a single kick!

83
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,950
Anyways, just give me back my helmet!

84
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,710
Charitable Donation!

85
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,560
I made so much money during the last two years thanks to you!

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,330
Huh? Thanks to me?

87
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,540
I captured dozens of prisoners

88
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,270
who you set free from the great prison - Impel Down!

89
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,770
I'm looking to catch every single one of you escapees!

90
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,940
"Star Clown" Buggy!

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,250
"First Son of the Sea" Jinbe!

92
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,380
Sir Crocodile!

93
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,350
The Queen of the Queers - Ivankov!

94
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,890
Shiliew of the Rain!

95
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,590
I'll hunt you all down and make a name for myself!

96
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,090
I wonder how Jinbe and Iva-chan are doing.

97
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,930
Not just you guys!

98
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,170
Those that didn't get announced to the public,

99
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,550
the super evil escapees from level 6!

100
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,150
From level 6?

101
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,360
I know where they are now!

102
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,830
I didn't know there were other escapees.

103
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,630
Damn! Why can't I hit him?!

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,400
Oops...

105
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,300
Give it back.

106
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,900
You bastard!

107
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,500
That hurt.

108
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,640
R-Ring out!

109
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,430
Jean the Bandit has been eliminated!

110
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,280
Knocked out with a single blow!

111
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,360
The legendary pirate - Don Chinjao head-butted him! {Halee: Maybe a comma after "Don Chinjao"?}

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,950
He's still got it after all these years!

113
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,780
Meanwhile, there is a breathtaking fight going on between two equally matched contenders!

114
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,290
They're a great match for each other!

115
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,020
This life-and-death struggle seems as if they're trying to

116
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,270
figure out which one of them is the strongest in this event!

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,130
They're both overwhelmingly strong!

118
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,410
No one else can compete!

119
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,580
The battle of willpower vs willpower!

120
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,350
This is a battle royal!

121
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,380
Yeah!

122
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,100
Fight!

123
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,010
The excitement is reaching its peak!

124
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,640
Go!

125
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,710
This is great!

126
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,050
Ideo!

127
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,480
Sai!

128
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,720
The whole Colosseum is keeping an eye on the fight between those two!

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,070
You can't get away now!

130
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,740
Garp's grandson!

131
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,040
You will pay for what he did to me, Straw Hat Luffy!

132
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,980
The sin of your grandpa that took my fortune away!

133
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,590
He also took away my power and the sweet memories of my younger days!

134
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,760
Like I said before, I don't know what you're talking about! Talk to my grandpa!

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,360
Death is too good a punishment for Garp!

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,730
He must live on with the pain of losing what's dear to him!

137
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,120
I guess I have no choice.

138
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,570
Let's do it.

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,480
Regardless of your grudge,
I can't win unless I beat you.

140
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,720
Let's settle this right here!

141
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,930
You're in the way!

142
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,600
Move!

143
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,520
The disposition of a king.

144
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,720
A Clash of the Color of Conquerors.

145
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,000
C-C Block!

146
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,970
There are only...

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,570
two men left!

148
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,510
It seems like all these famous, tough warriors have been knocked out by {Halee: Removed the ellipsis at the end since the next line seems to begin immediately afterwards. If not, restore it.}

149
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,720
the impact from the epic clash of those two men and have been taken out of the fight!

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,910
But what did we actually see?!

151
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,640
I didn't know you could use the Color of the Conqueror!

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,230
What kind of king are you dreaming of becoming?!

153
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,930
The Pirate King!

154
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,500
How laughable!

155
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,700
There are so many in the New World who can use that power!

156
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,980
And only a battle between you all will determine the winner!

157
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,320
The strongest among a legion of "Conquerors"!

158
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,330
That's who the Pirate King is!

159
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,460
Who taught you how to use that Haki?

160
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,500
Rayleigh!

161
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,780
He's still kicking?!

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,240
How annoying!

163
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,780
I don't even want to think about what happened in the past!

164
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,230
What?

165
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,510
Whaaat?!

166
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,410
Answer me, Straw Hat.

167
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,050
I want to forget but it's always right there in front of me!

168
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,650
But it's out of my reach! My treasure!

169
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,170
Can you imagine anything more painful than that?!

170
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
What's going on?! The legendary pirate is...

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,910
crying!

172
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,920
Grandpa...

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,690
I thought the plan was to let big brother advance to the final! {Halee: Maybe "the big brother"?}

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,510
I'm still not strong enough.

175
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,480
Nobody can stop him once he's at it!

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,420
"Chinjao the Drill."

177
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,570
That's what they used to call me, but not anymore.

178
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,380
Answer me!

179
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,870
Do you know what Garp has done to me?!

180
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,340
I told you that I don't know!

181
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,490
Go Lucy! Now's the chance!

182
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,090
Luffy-dono!

183
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:27,020
Sanji-dono, I want to get to the Toy House to rescue Kanjurou already!

184
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,030
I wanna help you with that but you have to wait.

185
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,260
We have an urgent situation here.

186
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,540
Look how many Marines there are around the Colosseum.

187
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,440
Why are there so many?

188
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,350
It seems like pirates and criminals are freely entering this competition.

189
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,680
The Marines are here to catch them as they come out.

190
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,430
Well, criminals should be caught.

191
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,940
Don't forget that you were on our pirate ship!

192
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,630
We need to get word to Luffy about this,

193
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,210
but the entrance for the competitors is completely closed off.

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,170
What's going on here-dara?

195
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,750
Has no one come out from the Colosseum yet-dara?

196
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,740
No, sir. Not yet.

197
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,100
There must be hundreds of losers from A-Block and B-Block-dara!

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,560
Why hasn't even a single one of them come out-dara?

199
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,840
It's strange.

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,490
Vice Admiral Maynard went undercover as a competitor

201
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:37,500
Marine Headquarters Vice Admiral
Shark Cutter Bastille

202
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,040
but we haven't had any contact with him for a while.

203
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Why did he do that on his own?

204
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,500
That punk!

205
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,770
Is something going on...

206
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,560
in the Colosseum-dara?

207
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,480
Here in Dressrosa, there are two laws...

208
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,480
that people must obey strictly...

209
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,110
since Doflamingo ascended to the throne 10 years ago.

210
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,800
First, curfew is at midnight on the dot.

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,760
Citizens must not go out after that.

212
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,390
What?! Even adults?!

213
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,560
Humans have to go back to their homes

214
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
and toys have to go back to their toy houses.

215
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,800
No one's allowed to go out after midnight.

216
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,050
You can't even go for a drink!

217
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,970
Everything is closed anyway.

218
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,770
Second,

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
toys must not enter human's houses

220
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,010
and humans must not enter toy's houses!

221
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,850
What?!

222
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,460
It looks like they're friendly with each other

223
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,190
but that's prohibited?!

224
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,810
But if that's the sad boundary between artifacts and living things, it can't be helped.

225
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, come to think of it, I'm kind of getting used to it already but...

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,610
what kind of toys are you guys?

227
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,850
You have free will and you can talk.

228
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,870
Whoever made you all must be a genius like Vegapunk.

229
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,850
Who was it?

230
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,130
Somebody, call the police!

231
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,520
What's going on?!

232
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,690
Please! Let go of me!

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,160
Esta, it's me!

234
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,960
The toy's broken! It's got "human disorder"!

235
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,300
Listen to me! It's not that!

236
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,060
Don't you remember, Esta?!

237
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,870
It's me!

238
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,990
Get away from me! You're freaking me out!

239
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,850
What happened all of a sudden?!

240
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,730
You've been friendly with her until now!

241
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,560
Please! Try to remember!

242
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,830
Get away from her!

243
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,520
Come with us!

244
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,750
Damn!

245
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,350
Esta! I'm your boyfriend!

246
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860
Don't hook up with that bastard!

247
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,130
Please remember me!

248
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,800
Let go of me! Dammit!

249
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,770
Calm down!

250
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,640
Stop!

251
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,370
Stop! Stop!

252
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,990
No! Let go of me, you bastards!

253
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,460
I'm a human!

254
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,280
Let me ride you, Onepoko!

255
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,800
No-wan! You're too heavy now-wan!

256
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,290
Onepoko!

257
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm not heavy! Onepoko!

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,090
Let me go talk to him.

259
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,770
Don't worry. He's a toy, too.

260
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,610
Well, yeah, a half of me is.

261
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,900
Hm, Onepoko's got it!

262
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Who are you?

263
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm that boy's father. And that woman is my wife.

264
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,420
My name is Milo, not Onepoko.

265
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,960
Hey boy, don't you have a daddy?

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,700
Huh? No, I don't!

267
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,530
Do you have a husband?

268
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,330
No, I don't. I'm not married.

269
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,640
It's not so unusual, is it?

270
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,000
Bye bye!

271
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,350
Hey soldier, what do you want to show me? What's going on here?

272
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,950
What I wanted to show you is...

273
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,990
... this country is filled with both the forgotten

274
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,190
and those who have forgotten them!

275
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,660
All of us toys were once humans!

276
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,060
What?!

277
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,440
A Devil Fruit user who Doflamingo brought 10 years ago, {Halee: Maybe ellipsis instead of comma?}

278
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,210
turned us all into toys!

279
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,390
Hey! That means you were...

280
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,800
There!

281
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,220
I see the Flower Field! I'll tell you everything there!

282
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,300
Green Bit

283
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,640
You have no mercy!

284
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,100
I'm all thumbs so...

285
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,630
Why is she not picking up?! Nami-ya!

286
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,850
I'm calling the right number!

287
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,380
Underneath Green Bit
Tontatta Kingdom

288
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,380
{\an8}It's Usoland's Haki!

289
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,820
Without tension rods the shelf will fall over.

290
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,590
Leo, are you ready to go? Do you need lunch?

291
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,460
Grandma, I'm sure there will be something to eat at headquarters.

292
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,490
Yeah?

293
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,370
Grandma!

294
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,200
I know, I'm gonna sew up everything that might fall over!

295
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,080
Okay, now it's safe!

296
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,690
I can't believe how powerful the hero is!

297
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,090
He can shake up the whole kingdom with the thing called Haki!

298
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,110
That's right!

299
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,960
Because Usoland is the legendary hero!

300
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,870
By the way, Leo, I won't fall over even though I look weak.

301
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,170
Tontatta Kingdom, huh?

302
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,050
What kind of relationship do they have with the Warlord Doflamingo?

303
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,050
Whatever it is, they're serious about fighting him.

304
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh, Usoland and Robiland, have you eaten enough?

305
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,060
Yeah, I'm totally stuffed...

306
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,660
I mean, I had enough and I'm ready to go!

307
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,010
Look, my body is trembling with excitement and making the ground shake!

308
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,500
How awesome!

309
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,140
He's unbelievable!

310
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,480
By the way, Leo, you people keep saying "fight" but...

311
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,010
... why do you wanna fight Doflamingo?

312
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,900
What?

313
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,510
The hero's very funny!

314
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,570
We want to rescue our 500 friends who are being forced

315
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,800
to work at the dark factory, of course!

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,590
What?! A factory?!

317
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,130
Is that the one that Luffy and the others went to destroy?!

318
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,480
Is that the one that's manufacturing SMILEs?

319
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,900
I don't know what they are making there,

320
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,490
but they also have the Tontatta Tribe's...

321
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,930
... obnoxious, selfish, mean, moody, short-tempered Princess Mancherie, too.

322
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,120
So we have to get going!

323
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,750
Don't you think you would be better off not rescuing her?

324
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,490
Yes, but...

325
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,190
... she's one of us too!

326
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,960
Noland would save everybody who's in trouble, wouldn't he?

327
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,800
What?!

328
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,980
Y-Yeah, he would! That's what a true hero does!

329
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,810
Since I'm his descendant, I'd do the same, of course!

330
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,730
That's our legendary hero!

331
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,450
Leo!

332
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,780
Flapper!

333
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,390
Leo, I just heard the Donquixote Family at the palace is on the move!

334
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,060
They're probably heading to the basement of the Colosseum!

335
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,070
Kabu-san's Yellow Cub and Bian's Pink Bee

336
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,700
are ready to take off anytime!

337
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,740
Okay!

338
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,100
Let's go! Usoland! Robiland!

339
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,250
The battle will take place in Dressrosa!

340
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,780
Underneath the Colosseum!

341
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,440
At the dark factory!

342
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,310
Everybody, let's go!

343
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,220
Yeah!
