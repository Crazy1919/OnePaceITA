and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,960
Just what has happened to his majesty?

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,550
The entire country has fallen into a panic.

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,560
I felt that there was something strange about him when he ran out of the palace earlier.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,750
But for him to do something like this...

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,800
Since this is no longer a matter we can handle ourselves, I've contacted the Navy.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,610
Captain Vergo said that he would handle things. {Cecil: LOL REKT}

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,600
Father...

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,440
Snow?

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,880
Monet? What are you doing here? {MAI WAIFU!!}

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,220
Why is a maid like you opening the palace gates?

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,790
Princess Viola, if you were to use your Clairvoyance,

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,700
then you should be able to see what is truly going on in this country.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,220
I am now preparing to welcome the new royal family.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,210
The eastern tower is on fire!

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,050
Pirates have invaded the palace!

44
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,100
Viola-sama has been taken hostage!

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,070
This palace has a good view.

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,470
It's not bad.

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,630
Yeah, it's great -dasuyan.

48
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,730
It's a palace worthy of the young master -in! {Cecil: I really hate his speech quirk}

49
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,510
Stop right there!

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,110
Are you Doflamingo's subordinates?!

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,380
Monet, release Viola-sama!

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,070
Did you guys do something to his majesty?!

53
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,840
My, things are going to get busy.

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,940
We must clean out the royal palace.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,770
Why is the Riku Royal Army doing this?!

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,170
Please stop!

57
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,880
If I'm forced to hurt my citizens...

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,960
I'd rather just die!

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,340
Someone please, kill me!

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,860
Why are you doing this, King Riku?

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,360
Have we done something wrong?

62
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,910
You were always righteous.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,870
You were...

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,530
the king we were proud of.

65
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,090
Since you asked for our money...

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,320
We gave you everything we had.

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,090
You've always thought of us first and foremost.

68
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,200
We were proud of our king!

69
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,300
King Riku...

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,270
King Riku has trampled on our feelings!

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,860
He's trying to kill us and steal our money!

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,530
For his own greed, he's treating us like trash!

73
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,570
Curse you, King Riku!

74
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,390
I hate you!

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,650
You're...

76
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,100
You're the scum of humanity!

77
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,840
The Riku Royal Army is coming!

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,410
Hey, get out of there, run away!

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
S-Save-

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,010
Who are you people?

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,970
I've come to save this country.

82
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,340
My name is Donquixote Doflamingo.{we're backstreet boys, the ones who sing "I don't care who you're, where you're from, what you did as long as you save me" ^^}

83
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,470
H-He's a pirate.

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,450
But they beat the Riku Royal Army.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,730
That was a beautiful dance, King Riku.

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,310
TrÃ©bol, Pica, Diamante. Go clean up the trash.

87
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,680
He did it!

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,260
We're saved.

89
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,800
Doflamingo! Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,130
Fall into depravity, embrace violence.

91
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,220
In just one night, the country fell under Doflamingo's control.

92
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,160
What a story, it's like a nightmare.

93
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,010
He's a cunning man.

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,040
I-I-I'll never forgive you, Doflamingo!

95
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,460
At the time, we too believed that King Riku had gone crazy, and approached the new king, Doflamingo.

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,230
This was the result.

97
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,070
I am ashamed that we couldn't believe in King Riku.

98
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,330
I see, it's really too bad.

99
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,920
Everyone loved the king so much, yet he died while being cursed for a crime he never committed.

100
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,770
No, King Riku is still alive.

101
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,830
Doflamingo wanted the ability of the princess at the time, Viola-sama.

102
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,730
So she gave him a condition.

103
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,190
If you promise not to kill my father, then

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,210
I will serve under you!

105
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,020
She is alive right now as Doflamingo's subordinate.

106
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
She changed her name to Violet, and is now a commander in the Family.

107
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,280
C-Commander?

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,850
Then, thanks to the princess, King Riku is...

109
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:36,310
Yes, he is alive somewhere in this country.

110
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,670
But, the pain he has gone through these past ten years is unimaginable.

111
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,620
And how hard it must have been for Viola-sama.

112
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,660
Fear, anger, tears!

113
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,980
I wonder how she's spent the last ten years.

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,020
She was controlled just like King Riku was, and forced to hurt the citizens.

115
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,520
The anger of those soldiers must be just as large.

116
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,560
Weren't King Riku's soldiers killed on that night?

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,110
Some were killed and some bowed down to Doflamingo.

118
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,070
They now live as his guards.

119
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,200
They changed sides!

120
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,420
I believe they were forced to make a difficult decision.

121
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,310
Don't screw with us!

122
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,170
They were under orders from the crazed King Riku.

123
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,580
Allow me to make them my subordinates.

124
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,790
If that's the case then they make me want to cry!

125
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,250
Every last one of them!

126
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,450
The soldiers that were killed, and the ones that bowed down.

127
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,830
Even if we add them up, they're too few to make up the army of a country.

128
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,400
What are you talking about?

129
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,940
I mean that I have lost memories as well.

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,250
Fraland. I showed you in town, correct?

131
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,500
We remember everything from when we were human,

132
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,530
but everyone else, even our families, forgot everything about us.

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,750
Nobody knows they've forgotten about people important to them.

134
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,840
That is the greatest tragedy of Dressrosa,
and it goes for us toys as well.

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,910
So among all those toys walking around town, there may be some of your old comrades.

136
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,470
But you yourself have forgotten them so you don't know?

137
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,410
Exactly.

138
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,890
Also, everyone who was turned into a toy harbors hatred toward Doflamingo.

139
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,690
Doflamingo has buried anyone who opposed him.

140
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,200
Which means that in the country's darkness, there are countless people who oppose him.

141
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,400
That unknown number of tragedies{Yeah this phrasing might be a bit awkward, but I really feel we should keep this line in... Partially because the manga-chapter this episode was based off was literally NAMED "Number of tragedies". -Starfish} is the key to our plan.

142
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,140
I see, so that's it.

143
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,290
That's what you meant when you said you still have a chance.{Isis: I changed the line a bit to match what was said in ep 652, and I didn't like the previous phrasing anyway :P }

144
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,310
True, with just these numbers, taking on a Warlord and his crew would be near impossible.

145
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,210
But if every toy in the country were to join us,
then that would make for quite the fighting force.

146
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,710
Hey, wait up a bit!

147
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,370
Why are you trying to go after Doflamingo as well?!

148
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,160
Our only goal is the destruction of the factory.

149
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,550
When we've done that, we're getting out of this country.

150
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,790
Isn't that right, Robin?

151
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,560
I won't forgive Doflamingo.

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,270
Today is the day of our long awaited final battle!

153
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,910
The event of this morning was a challenge to us!

154
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,420
And the fact that Usoland appeared here today is no coincidence!

155
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,980
It is the heavens telling us to fight!

156
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,470
The event of this morning?

157
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,110
When Doflamingo temporarily abdicated his throne.

158
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh that, yeah, we were the-

159
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,000
Can you imagine our delight when we heard the news?

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,060
We thought a miracle had occurred.

161
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,050
And then the notice that it was misinformation.

162
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,330
To us, it was like being dropped from heaven into the depths of hell.

163
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,980
So it was only natural for us to make today the day we fight him.

164
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,430
Umm, I'm really sorry.

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,800
Beneath Dressrosa

166
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,720
{\an8}Even though you're retired, you brought a ship over here?

167
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,720
Scrap Yard

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,780
Well I don't have anyone to take over the Happou Navy.

169
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,360
If only I had a grandchild.

170
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,910
I see.

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,000
So things aren't going well, even for the villains.

172
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,060
Is it just my imagination?

173
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,470
I feel like there's a gap in my memory.

174
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,720
I had the same feeling ten years ago.

175
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,280
What the hell, where on earth am I going?!

176
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,610
Gramps, save me!

177
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,750
What did they do to me, the lone wolf, Abdullah?!

178
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,890
What did they do to me, the maverick warrior, Jeet?!

179
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,490
Help!

180
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,990
Corrida Colosseum

181
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,990
Zoro!

182
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,120
Damn that hen-comb guy.

183
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,320
He said he'd show me the way, then he just collapsed.

184
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Is Zoro really here?

185
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,510
Hey, Zoro, Kin'emon!

186
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,640
Luffy!

187
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,250
You're being too loud, you idiot!

188
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,020
I had my doubts, but it would appear that the odd-speaking fellow was able to carry out his mission.

189
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,420
Where is he?

190
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,900
He just collapsed on the way here.

191
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,120
I finally found you, Straw Hat!

192
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,010
Joker wants me to kill Straw Hat?{Copy-paste from 644}

193
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,970
Get it done before the tournament ends.

194
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,790
Do so, and you'll finally be a member of the Family. {End copy-paste from 644}

195
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,100
Sorry about this, Straw Hat.

196
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,650
Ah, there you are, Bellamy.

197
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,870
Are you done with the assassination yet?

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,990
Doesn't seem like it.

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,330
What do you want, Dellinger?!

200
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:27,390
Donquixote Family (â¦Diamante Army)
Combatant, Dellinger

201
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,720
Well, I figured...

202
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,400


203
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,540
you'd lose your nerve and be unable to kill him.

204
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,850
What?!

205
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,840
Well, I guess it was unavoidable, seeing who the target was.

206
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,430
Well, it doesn't really matter whether you succeed or not.

207
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,690
What's that supposed to mean?!

208
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,660
The assassination order was just one of his whims. {Xemnas: Nuance and all}

209
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,530
He said it was a pain having you cling to him all the time,

210
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,650
so I'm meant to kill you right here. {Cecil4: I put in "kill" cause "take you out" seems a bit weird in this context.. but if he said something that dosen't infer killing, beating up or w/e, feel free to change it back.}

211
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,990
Under the young master's orders.{If this sounded a bit weird, feel free to add "under" at the beginning .Isis}

212
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,620
What... the hell?!

213
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,790
Oops!

214
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,080
I wasn't supposed to mention that!

215
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,130
Sorry!

216
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,020
You've gotta be kidding me!

217
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,450
The steel bridge on the outskirts of Dressrosa

218
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,020
Mes!

219
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,800
Bullet Thread!

220
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,940
So what will you do, Law?

221
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,710
Dressrosa is right behind you.

222
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,410
Hey, Doffy.

223
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,040
Oh, sorry. Were you busy?

224
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,760
Not particularly. Go on.

225
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,790
Violet has betrayed us.

226
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,670
Black Leg just showed up earlier, so I wondered what had happened.

227
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,550
The plan was to have her expose Straw Hat's plan with her Glare Fruit powers,

228
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,890
but it seems we'll have to remain ignorant.

229
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,960
Oh, no problems there.

230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Diamante, station Lao G and the others around the entrances to the Smile factory.

231
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Diamante, station Lao G and the others around the entrances to the Smile factory.

232
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,250
Don't be ridiculous.

233
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,140
They're supposed to participate in the finale, to make things more exciting for the audience.

234
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,610
You'll be more than enough to entertain them.

235
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,010
Oh, you talk as if I'm some kind of prodigy. {Yet another Oda running gag, lol}

236
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,870
But you are. Only you can do it.

237
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,400
No really, stop acting like I'm-

238
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,700
You are a prodigy!

239
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,040
If you must insist, then very well!

240
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,630
Law. You were going to distract me,

241
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,650
and then the Straw Hats would use that chance to destroy the factory.

242
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,590
Once the factory was destroyed, then it wouldn't matter if you were alive or dead.

243
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,230
Having lost the Smiles, I would get killed by Kaidou. {His head is bobbing like a freaking pigeon O_O}

244
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,330
That was the plan, right?

245
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,600
But you were defeated much sooner than you anticipated, {Cecil: aka he didn't expect to have to face Fujitora ALONGSIDE Doflamingo}

246
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,170
and the Straw Hats will fall in turn.

247
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,700
You may say you were just using them,

248
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,370
but this plan required an immense amount of trust in the Straw Hats.

249
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,230
Why do you...

250
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,450
believe so strongly in him?

251
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,820
"D" will definitely...

252
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,200
cause another storm! {Cecil: Doffy's reaction to this isn't canon btw, so don't read into it like he knows the secret to the D and is mad about it. Talking to you, Isis!}{Wakarimashita Senpai  >.

253
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,500
So what did you want, Zoro?

254
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,940
Listen, if there was a tournament like this going on, why didn't you invite me?!

255
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,940
Sorry!

256
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,790
Dressrosa
In front of the Corrida Colosseum

257
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,070
{\an8}Here we are running all over town while you're just having fun!

258
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,490
That was not our message, sir!

259
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,710
Vice-Admiral Bastille!

260
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,010
Just as we thought, that man is the Pirate Hunter!

261
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,390
What's more, we believe the man inside the Colosseum is Straw Hat Luffy!

262
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,890
Vice-Admiral at Navy HQ
Shark-Slicer Bastille

263
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,890
You mean the winner of Block C, Lucy?

264
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,130
That explains his strength.

265
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,330
So he's in this country, just like Smoker reported.

266
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,280
Shall we capture him?

267
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,410
No, let him swim free for now.

268
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,570
That place is crawling with...

269
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:24,680
pirates, bounty-hunters and mercenaries renowned throughout the New World.

270
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,820
If we go in there and cause a ruckus trying to capture Straw Hat,

271
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,060
we'll be found out.

272
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,860
We'll capture all the villains who come out of the colosseum, without letting a single one go free.

273
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,030
If we're gonna do this, we might as well take them all down in one fell swoop.

274
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,220
The fighters who have been defeated are...

275
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,230
Block C's Don Chinjao, and...

276
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,810
I don't recognize any of these names.

277
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,480
Who are we even here to capture?

278
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,550
What?

279
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,930
Will this do?

280
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,520
What are you doing?

281
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,730
Sanji-dono told me to call him once we meet Luffy-dono.

282
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,330
Okay.

283
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,020
Oh right, Luffy.

284
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,070
The navy has surrounded the colosseum.{Isis: I'm not sure if it should be marines or the navy. I forgot, so shoot me}

285
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,630
So casual! That's what we came to say!{Cecil: Is he trying to say "That's why we came to see you?" cause if so I don't really think it shows}{Xemnas: Yeah, that's pretty much what he means.}

286
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,080
The seas surrounding Dressrosa

287
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,060
That's Kin'emon.

288
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,710
Oh, Sanji? It's me.

289
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,830
Luffy?

290
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,680
Right, Chopper. Use that one to contact Usopp.

291
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,760
Alright.

292
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,650
Usopp here!

293
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,350
So now we've got everyone except Law.

294
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,460
What's going on over there on your ends?

295
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,910
Franky here!

296
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,530
Usopp and Robin are here too.

297
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,450
What are you doing?!

298
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,090
Listen up, all of you.

299
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,600
We're here together with the rebels fighting Doflamingo, the Riku Royal Army.

300
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Army?

301
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,540
An army of dwarves.

302
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,530
Dwarves?

303
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,000
Usoland, what are you doing?

304
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,240
We're having a hero's meeting! Don't eavesdrop!

305
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,420
Very well.

306
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,910
Excuse us!{Xemnas: Dem tails}

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,940
Hey Luffy,

308
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,000
you remember that strange soldier we met in front of the colosseum?

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,980
Yeah. So what's this about dwarves?

310
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,690
It turns out he was the captain of this army.

311
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,990
And the gang gathered here are planning to fight Doflamingo, today.

312
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,880
Wait, soldier?

313
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,630
He intends to sacrifice his own life...{Copy-paste from 650}

314
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,660
to bring down this kingdom!{End copy-paste from 650}

315
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, right! About that toy-soldier...

316
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,460
He's the one Rebecca wanted to stop!

317
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,700
Franky, you've gotta stop that army!

318
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,610
Like hell!

319
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm trying to say the exact opposite of that!

320
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,790
Did you talk to that Rebecca-girl?

321
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,010
Yeah. She's really nice.

322
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,620
She's poor, and she still bought me three lunch-boxes!

323
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,880
But once she entered the fight, the audience started really pissing me off! {Cecil: Does he specify that they peppered her with insults? Cause I'd think that would be worth stating in this line}{Xemnas: No he doesn't}

324
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,430
I agree.

325
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,360
Luffy. I...

326
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,140
can't follow Traf's plan!

327
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,510
H-Hey, Franky, what are you saying?!

328
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,680
Traf's plan was like this, right?

329
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:12,130
We destroy the factory, and then let Doflamingo live so that we can use him to get to Kaidou.

330
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,720
But if we do that...

331
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,220
what becomes of the guys who are planning to fight Doflamingo today?

332
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,220
The dwarves won't back down.

333
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,980
This country may have seemed like fun,

334
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,600
but there's a deep, deep darkness here.

335
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:34,370
They're all about to put their lives on the line to destroy that darkness!

336
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,940
Considering their size, that's really inspiring.

337
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,680
This tiny, brave army is standing up to that filthy, gigantic foe.

338
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,250
I...

339
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,520
can't abandon them.

340
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,780
can't abandon them.

341
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,130
Do you think that we should still let Doflamingo win in spite of that?

342
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,120
Luffy. It doesn't matter what you say...

343
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,540
I won't back down! {Previously: I will do this! I edited this a bit liberally}

344
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,210
Franky...

345
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,180
Soldier-san's gonna die.{Copy-paste from 651.}

346
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Franky.

347
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,470
Do whatever you want!

348
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,910
We'll be right there!

349
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,490
Thanks!

350
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,700
Alright, let's turn around.

351
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
Whaaat?!

352
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,830
I knew it!

353
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,770
Shores of Dressrosa

354
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,780
What?

355
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,770
What's going on in the city?!

356
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,330
Issho-san, there's a huge fight taking place in the city!

357
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,680
Let's move.

358
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,370
What's that? I heard a loud noise from your end.

359
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,390
What could that be? The city is...

360
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,690
Whatever it is, it's getting closer!

361
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,590
What's going on?! I can't see!

362
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
What?!

363
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,600
Vice-Admiral Bastille, is that...

364
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,270
Doflamingo!

365
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,050
Traf!

366
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,180
You brat!

367
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,860
Hey, Traf!

368
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,780
Why are you with Doflaming-

369
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,690
You got too cocky for your own good.

370
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,730
Cora-san...

371
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,710
Traf!
