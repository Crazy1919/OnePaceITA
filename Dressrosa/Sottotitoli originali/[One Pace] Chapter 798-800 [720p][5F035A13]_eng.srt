1168

Father and Sons

1169
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,690
Hey!  What happened to the
eastern port reinforcements?!

1170
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Sir!

1171
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,650
Well, most of our units have been incapacitated...

1172
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,900
What do you mean?

1173
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,690
The bullets and gunpowder have vanished from their rifles!

1174
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,950
And all their other weapons - swords, pistols, axes, spears, and knives... {guy on the right demonstrates for us how not to check your weaponThese guys are worse than stormtroopers}

1175
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,270
...went missing, too!

1176
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,580
They must have been stolen.

1177
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,420
And at the port,

1178
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,670
the warships are stuck together
as if they were sewn to each other,

1179
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,050
so they can't set sail!

1180
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,930
How do you even sew iron together?!

1181
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Just cut the string!  Cut it!

1182
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,230
But we don't have any knives!

1183
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,440
Meanwhile, the soldiers who suddenly collapsed are still paralyzed...

1184
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,320
What are you doing, you incompetents?!

1185
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,730
I apologize, sir!

1186
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,110
So you're just gonna let the Straw Hats and the other criminals walk away?!

1187
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,450
Do something!

1188
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,030
W-We'll do our best, sir!

1189
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Is it really okay to take this much
healing power from them today, Mousey? {they say "healing properties", but that sounds really weird. I'm open to suggestions.-Jules}

1190
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,460
The donors will be paralyzed
if we take too much out of them.

1191
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,170
It's fine, we have permission!

1192
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,670
From Kyros-sama.

1193
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,050
Just do as I say, Princess!

1194
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,800
Okay!  Then I won't hesitate!

1195
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,180
There are still so many heavily-injured people!{Double check this hyphen}

1196
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,730
I know you're in the middle of taking donations,
but we have to go...

1197
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,900
We'll be all done soon!

1198
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,530
Oh, I'll just wait then!

1199
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,650
According to the locals,

1200
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,410
all these strange occurrences are the work of fairies.

1201
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,250
Cut the fairy crap, you imbecile!

1202
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,160
I-I-I-I'm sorry, sir!

1203
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,190
Entrance to the
Eastern Port

1204
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,090
B-Barrier!

1205
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,260
Can your barrier even hold him back?!

1206
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,390
If it were breakable, it wouldn't be called a barrier!

1207
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,970
Just hold him off until Luffy-senpai and Trafalgar get here!

1208
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
Yeah!

1209
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,320
Are they fighting?!

1210
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,360
Want some rice crackers?

1211
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,940
I don't want any.  Just get on with it.

1212
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,200
A boy with White Lead Disease?! {this seems new -- script search yielded no results for these lines. Please double check -Jules}

1213
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,530
So there was a survivor from White Town?!

1214
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,490
He hates everything about the world.

1215
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,850
Feels like I'm watching my
older brother when he was a kid.

1216
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,020
I feel sorry for him, but there's no way to cure White Lead Disease.

1217
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,380
Don't get too involved, or you'll give yourself away.

1218
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,010
Yes, sir.  Understood.

1219
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,970
I'm just here to stop my brother.

1220
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,900
Doflamingo is a savage man.

1221
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
I won't let him reach Dressrosa.

1222
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,340
On that day, a Marine died.

1223
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,680
{\an4}Near the
Eastern Port

1224
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,680
That Marine was someone special to me.

1225
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,080
I met him when he was a kid,
and I thought of him as my son.

1226
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,790
He was very honest, and he had a stronger sense of justice than anyone I know.

1227
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,090
He was a most trustworthy subordinate.

1228
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,400
But only once in his lifetime did he ever lie to me.

1229
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,990
Landing party, reporting in. {this bit's new}

1230
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,740
There is a commander of
the Donquixote Family among the dead.

1231
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,610
Code name: Corazón.

1232
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,300
Photo transmitted.  Please confirm.

1233
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,840
Rocinante!

1234
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,150
Why were you there on the island?!

1235
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,460
I was betrayed.

1236
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,230
However, there must have been a reason.

1237
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,070
Four things were lost during that incident:

1238
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,610
The Barrels Pirates.

1239
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,970
My subordinate.

1240
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,980
The Ope Ope Fruit.

1241
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,750
And who was residing with the
Donquixote Family at the time...

1242
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,390
a boy suffering from White Lead Disease!

1243
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,940
Yeah.

1244
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,400
It was me.

1245
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
As I thought.

1246
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,380
So you're the reason why Rocinante took a half-year break from his mission?

1247
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,370
Yeah, he took me to quite a few hospitals.

1248
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,400
And then he went after the Ope Ope Fruit,

1249
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,220
sacrificing himself to save you in the process?

1250
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,300
I just want to know what exactly it was he died for.

1251
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,240
Yeah, alright.

1252
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,320
Actually, we were gonna escape together.

1253
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,480
He gave me back my life and my humanity.

1254
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,180
I'm forever in his debt.

1255
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,150
And it's solely for that reason I've remained alive.
I wanted to kill Doflamingo on his behalf!

1256
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,420
But...

1257
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know if this is how he wanted me to live, as a bearer of the name "D".

1258
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,630
"D"?

1259
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,200
Just like Straw Hat, I also have that secret name.

1260
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,440
You're the former Fleet Admiral.

1261
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,010
You wouldn't happen to know something about the meaning behind "D", would you?

1262
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,220
Who knows?

1263
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,820
Hey, don't play dumb!

1264
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,820
At the very least,

1265
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,720
I know Rocinante had no idea.

1266
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,160
In other words, that wasn't the reason he saved you.

1267
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,700
Don't search for a reason...

1268
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,540
for somebody to love you!

1269
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,290
I love you!

1270
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,520
So he's another one of them.

1271
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,250
Those that bear the name "D"
always lead unfortunate lives.

1272
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,050
If I were still on active duty,

1273
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,690
I would've imprisoned you
to have more time to talk, but...

1274
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,400
Ironically, you're the only person who I can share
the memory of Rocinante with - a pirate, at that.

1275
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:48,210
If we really want to do something in his memory,
both you and I...

1276
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,880
should never forget him.

1277
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,880
That's good enough.
You live your life as you like.

1278
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
That's what...

1279
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,460
...he would say.

1280
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,530
What?!

1281
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,040
This must be...

1282
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,510
What the, what the?!

1283
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,510
Oh, the rubble...

1284
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,180
Get away from it!

1285
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,560
What in the world is going on?

1286
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
The broken buildings are rising up into the air!

1287
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,920
All the rubble in the country is flying toward the east port!

1288
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,820
What in the world is...

1289
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,560
going on here?!

1290
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,830
Is this the work of a god?
Or perhaps some mysterious birds?

1291
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,250
There's only one person who's capable of this
on the island now!

1292
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,470
This is the doing of the Navy Admiral, Fujitora!

1293
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,250
Well...

1294
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,030
I suppose nobody's using any of this.

1295
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,400
This is all that's left after those hideous pirates fought!

1296
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,690
Don't tell me he's gonna use that as a weapon!

1297
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,780
A barrier that only covers a limited area
won't stand a chance against this!

1298
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,110
Is he crazy?!

1299
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,610
That ain't fair!

1300
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,250
What is happening?!

1301
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,010
We don't have time to be surprised!

1302
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,560
We gotta go help the Usolanders!

1303
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,660
Is he planning on bringing down the pirates with that?

1304
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,570
No one will survive that!

1305
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,240
This is unbelievable!

1306
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
Does this mean their escape plan failed?!

1307
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,140
Lucy!

1308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,530
Vice Admiral Bastille.

1309
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,890
Bastille!

1310
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,990
Huh?  Oh, oh, Tsuru-san!

1311
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,250
My sincere apologies.

1312
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,390
I couldn't believe my eyes, so I...

1313
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,560
Still need... reinforcements?

1314
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,430
No, ma'am!

1315
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,570
All Navy units!

1316
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,890
Reinforcements are no longer required in the east!

1317
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,140
All units, fall back from the eastern port!

1318
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,590
Evacuate all personnel and lead civilians somewhere safe!

1319
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,680
Do not interfere with Isshou-san...
I mean, the Navy Admiral!

1320
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,550
Hey, guys!

1321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,890
We're in danger no matter where we are!
Head to the port on the double and set sail!

1322
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,400
Got it, Trafal...

1323
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Gah!

1324
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,580
Law!

1325
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,800
We've been waiting on you and Straw Hat!
Where the hell were you?!

1326
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,040
Everybody, head for the ship!
Prepare to cast off!

1327
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,440
Aye, aye!

1328
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Over there!  Here he comes!

1329
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,310
Luffy!

1330
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,320
Luffy-senpai!  Hurry up!

1331
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,330
Straw Hat!

1332
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,890
Everybody's here!  Run for the ship!

1333
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,330
Luffy-senpai!
Watch out for Fujitora, he's right there!

1334
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,100
Luffy-senpai, hurry up!
Just dodge him somehow!

1335
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,240
Dodge?

1336
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,870
Hey, old gambler guy!
Do you remember me?!

1337
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,780
I've been expecting you, Straw Hat!

1338
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,530
Gonna punch you!

1339
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,420
Gomu Gomu no...

1340
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,950
Elephant Gun!

1341
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,770
Luffy-senpai!

1342
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,310
He's a Navy Admiral!  Whaddya think yer doin'?!

1343
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,540
"We'll beat them someday" isn't good enough anymore!

1344
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,320
He may be a Navy Admiral, but why should I run?!

1345
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,450
I would've done that two years ago, but not now!

1346
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,720
Even if they're a Navy Admiral or an Emperor,

1347
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
I gotta beat 'em all!

1348
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,460
Or else...

1349
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,330
There's no way I'll be Pirate King!

1350
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,800
Gonna punch you!

1351
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,920
Gomu Gomu no...

1352
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,080
Hawk Bullet!

1353
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,200
Why's he gotta be so serious about fightin' at a time like this?

1354
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,900
Are you out of your mind, Straw Hat?!

1355
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,380
Should we help?

1356
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,020
Gonna stomp you!

1357
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,420
Gomu Gomu no...

1358
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,090
Hawk Axe!

1359
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,710
I'm totally on board with what Luffy said,

1360
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,600
but why's he fighting strangely?

1361
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,210
Gonna kick you!

1362
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,050
Oh, crap!  I meant "punch"!

1363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
Sorry, old man!

1364
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,490
No worries.

1365
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,300
Here I go, old man!

1366
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,540
Gonna punch you!

1367
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,810
Gonna kick and punch you!

1368
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,310
A whole buncha punches!

1369
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,980
Push you!

1370
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,750
Head!

1371
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,680
Stomp you!

1372
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,360
My body's getting lighter and heavier...
What's going on?!

1373
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,440
Straw Hat!

1374
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,170
That's why I told ya to run, Luffy-senpai!

1375
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,650
I'm not gonna...

1376
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,520
run anymore!

1377
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,430
Indeed.  You appear strong enough to back those words.

1378
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,330
I like your tenacity, however...

1379
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,530
Gonna punch you!

1380
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,110
What exactly have you been doing all this time?

1381
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,500
Announcing you're going to "kick" or "punch" me...

1382
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,500
Are you taking pity on me?!

1383
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,380
I'm a Navy Headquarters Admiral!
Everyone says I'm like a monster!

1384
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,650
I don't want anybody going easy on me
after all these years!

1385
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:19,320
Does it bother you that a blind man is on the battlefield?!

1386
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,490
If you wanted to anger me, you succeeded!

1387
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,700
I'll chop off your head before you know it!

1388
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,110
Shut up!

1389
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,900
I just can't hit a blind man
like you without saying something!

1390
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,110
Because I don't hate you, old man!

1391
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,900
What's so funny?!

1392
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,630
Gonna kick you!

1393
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,900
Your sympathy!

1394
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,640
What purpose does it serve?

1395
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,320
A whole buncha punches!

1396
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,170
How very disappointing!  You make no sense!

1397
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,430
Gonna punch you...

1398
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,150
...with everything I've got!

1399
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,180
When men fight,

1400
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,890
they should fight in a way befitting their position.

1401
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,030
You cannot...

1402
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,030
show pity, nor tell someone you like or hate them
in such a straightforward manner!

1403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,130
You're such a fool!

1404
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,270
I fight as befits my position,
even though I don't want to!

1405
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
Gravity Sword!

1406
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,110
Raging Tiger!

1407
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,410
There's Straw Hat, Hajrudin!

1408
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,010
Hey!  Leggo of me, giant!

1409
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,970
Take him to the ship!

1410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,450
Alright, Luffy!  It's my turn!

1411
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,070
Don't, don't!  Please stop, Zoro-senpai!

1412
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,070
We've already made arrangements!

1413
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,060
"Arrangements"?

1414
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,090
Hey, you said you had a ship for us at the port,
but there are probably too many-

1415
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,240
Look around you!  No one would want to moor their ship in such a dangerous port!

1416
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,060
Wha?!

1417
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,780
I-Is this...

1418
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,030
Th-These ships are all lined up!
There's so many!

1419
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,290
You've got that right!
The others' ships are in the fog, five kilometers ahead!

1420
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,460
Cross the sea by taking this connecting bridge,
courtesy of our Great Yonta Maria Fleet!

1421
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,220
Hey!  I'm still fighting!

1422
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,290
Let go!

1423
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,040
Stop it already!  I beg you!

1424
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,620
Hey, lemme go!  I wanna fight!

1425
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,610
Some other time.
We have things to do.

1426
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,960
It's much too late for you, Straw Hat.

1427
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,810
What do you think, Straw Hat?

1428
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,660
Though I cannot see it myself,
I know it is right before your eyes.

1429
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,820
The dark sky is telling you
that you have nowhere to run.

1430
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,240
As you set sail,
rubble shall rain upon you without end.

1431
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,900
Your entire armada will sink.

1432
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,000
Can you not see?

1433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,670
If by some chance you escape me,
the Four Emperors will take action.

1434
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,810
By taking down Joker,
you'll be targeted for execution.

1435
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,090
And your future will be nothing short of hell.

1436
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,540
You may have pitied me for my blindness, but...

1437
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,710
I asked for this.

1438
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:59,400
I blinded myself because there are
so many things I wish I had not seen.

1439
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,230
Well, then.

1440
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,480
At least permit me to guide you to hell!

1441
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,260
Give us back Rebecca, Lucy!

1442
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,210
Weren't you a hero, Lucy?!

1443
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,740
Is that...

1444
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,940
This country has done a lot of harm to her!

1445
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,720
Don't further her misery!

1446
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,730
Citizens, halt your advance!

1447
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,880
Past this point are only criminals!

1448
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,750
Come no further!  I shall put an end to-

1449
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,650
Move it, Navy!

1450
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,360
We don't need your help!

1451
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,330
We'll shake off the pirates ourselves!

1452
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,870
What is it?  It's pretty noisy back there!

1453
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,750
It's the people of Dress Rosa!
What do they want now?

1454
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,010
Prepare yourself, Lucy!

1455
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,600
Lucy!

1456
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,130
We'll catch you no matter what!

1457
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,050
Get ships under way!
Let's chase him out to sea!

1458
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,710
They're...

1459
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
Lucy!

1460
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,470
You won't get away, you jerk!

1461
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,680
There is not a single trace of resentment in their voices.

1462
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,300
Lucy, wait!  Give us back Rebecca-sama!

1463
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,540
Hey, everybody!

1464
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,190
I saw Rebecca-sama at the house on the top of the hill with Kyros-sama!

1465
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,860
That so?  But everyone already knew that.

1466
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,080
Huh?!

1467
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,220
If Kyros-sama gives in, they'll stay together...

1468
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,200
because they're actually father and daughter.

1469
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,950
We adults have known that for sixteen years.

1470
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,010
We knew about Scarlett-sama and her family of three,

1471
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,390
living happily on the top of the hill.

1472
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,360
We've known about the true identity of the fairies, too!
We've all been watching them.

1473
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,450
Really?

1474
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,690
Anyway, we gotta run faster!

1475
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,350
We need to help the saviors of our country escape!

1476
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,100
If we follow Lucy,
Fujitora won't be able to drop the rubble from the sky!

1477
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,540
Wait, Lucy!  Give us back, Rebecca-sama!

1478
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,170
Wait, you bastard!

1479
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,520
You are truly honest to a fault, Straw Hat Luffy.

1480
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,090
I suppose everyone here wants to help you.

1481
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,760
What kind of person are you, exactly?

1482
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,270
What color is your hair?
What shape are your eyes?

1483
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,520
What do you look like?

1484
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,310
I wish I hadn't closed these eyes.

1485
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,690
I'd have liked to see your face.

1486
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,150
I wager you have the face of someone kind.

1487
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,040
Now, what shall I do
with this weapon I've raised?

1488
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,180
How embarrassing of me.

1489
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,720
Straw Hat, that bastard!

1490
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,930
All our dealings with Doflamingo
came to nothing now!

1491
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,810
Don't let him get away from Dressrosa!

1492
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,910
If King Riku has returned to the throne,

1493
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,730
we want him to pay the price for that, too!

1494
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,870
After we wipe out
Straw Hat Luffy and all of his allies...

1495
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,940
We'll rampage all over Dressrosa!

1496
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,820
All right! From now on,

1497
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,200
let's form an allied fleet
built on our mutual hate of Straw Hat!

1498
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,760
Cut off his head at any cost!

1499
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,600
All soldiers have retreated!
However, citizens are running to the port!

1500
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,470
What's Isshou-san doing?

1501
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,810
How long does he plan to keep all that rubble in the sky?

1502
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,580
Well, wouldja look at that!

1503
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,680
Whoa, it's huge!

1504
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,240
Great Yonta Maria Fleet Flagship

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,400
{\an8}Ain't she a beauty?

1506
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,840
{\an8}She's not yours!

1507
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,420
{\an8}Right, make it quick and climb aboard!

1508
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,420
{\an8}This's a state of emergency!

1509
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,170
{\an8}I'll show you my ship later!
It'll knock yer socks off!

1510
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,280
Straw Hat!
I have four fellow mercenary giants!

1511
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,250
I eventually want to unify all the Giant tribes with them.

1512
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,750
Together, we'll revive the Giant Pirates
that once terrorized the world!

1513
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,910
The Giant Pirates! Those were the glory days of Masters Dorry and Brogy, Luffy!

1514
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,750
Oh yeah?  You'll be a tough enemy to fight!

1515
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,920
Well, I guess we'll see you again someday, somewhere!

1516
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,760
I wanna go to Elbaf!

1517
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,470
Our Great Yonta Maria Fleet numbers 56 ships!
I just know we'll be able to help you out!

1518
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,600
Help us?

1519
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,930
Luffyland, we got permission from Chief Tonta!

1520
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,220
We wanna join you, too!

1521
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,170
"Join"?

1522
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,920
We won't lose in a fair fight,

1523
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,640
but we can't call ourselves champions without fighting pirates!

1524
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,130
So, Ideo and I joined forces and decided to set out to sea!

1525
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,550
Hey, we're with you guys, too!
Don't forget about us, bros!

1526
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,580
This guy's allowing me to join his crew.

1527
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,370
I'm doing you a favor, so you'd better call me Captain!

1528
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,680
And as for you!
Don't forget that I'm more experienced than you!

1529
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,700
Even if I go along with you,
I'll be the most popular!

1530
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,140
What're you guys talking about?
You're free to do whatever you want!

1531
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,950
Well, the fact is we totally hit it off
while we were staying at the Palace for two days!

1532
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,410
Huh?

1533
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:52,120
I shall explain!
Just so you know, we decided the order by lot.

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,680
Former Bounty Hunters, Abdullah & Jeet

1551
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,660
XXX Gym Fighters' Alliance

1552
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,660

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,390
{\an8}Their leader is the warrior, Leo!

1558
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,590
{\an8}Only five members at the moment,

{\an8}the soon-to-be Giant Pirates!

1560
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,690
Giant Pirates

1561
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,690

1563
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,830
{\an8}And as for me...

1564
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,450
{\an8}Commodore of the Great Yonta Maria Fleet, 4,300 strong!

1565
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,740
Great Yonta Maria Fleet

1566
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,590
{\an8}Pioneer and adventurer, Orlumbus!

1567
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,910
H-Hey...

1568
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,110
That makes a large battalion of about 5,600 people in total!

1569
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,210
Luffy-senpai!

1570
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:35,650
Will you exchange cups of sake with us seven representatives, as father and sons?

1571
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,250
"Father and sons"?

1572
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,480
That's right!

1573
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,960
You be the boss, and we'll be your followers!

1574
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,060
Will you take us under the flag of the Straw Hat Pirates?

1575
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,310
{\an8}Big boss

1576
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,680
Alright, we'll exchange father-and-son vows

1577
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,110
to inaugurate Luffy-senpai as our boss

1578
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,780
and us seven as his followers...

1579
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,220
I'm not gonna drink this!

1580
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,020
What?!

1581
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,130
I thought so.

1582
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,460
I don't like this sake much.

1583
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,510
No, it's not about the taste!
It's about the vow!

1584
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:28,620
From now on, you'll be targeted by big names because of the incident on this island!

1585
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,160
When that happens,

1586
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,580
it doesn't matter how strong you all are,
it's gonna be a tough battle!

1587
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,810
But since you saved us,
we can help you at those times!

1588
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,680
Yes! Yes!

1589
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,650
But if I drink this,

1590
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll become the grand captain
of this grand fleet, right?

1591
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,430
That's right.

1592
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,100
With 5,600 followers in total,
you'll finally be counted among the greatest pirates!

1593
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,650
You are the man who will become
the Pirate King someday!

1594
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,230
If you wanna conquer the world,
this won't be enough though.

1595
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,410
You'd better stop!

1596
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,050
That line of reasoning won't work on him.

1597
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,770
Anyway, pour this into a beer mug.

1598
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,750
I'll drink it.

1599
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,890
Like I said we're not doing this to enjoy the taste!

1600
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,900
Why, Straw Hat?!

1601
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,860
Why aren't you happy to amass such a great military force?!

1602
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,080
Doesn't matter how strong your enemy is -

1603
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,810
he can't compete against the force of numbers!

1604
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm sure you'll need our help someday
like we needed you!

1605
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,410
I need my space!

1606
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,810
What?! He looks so annoyed!

1607
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,250
That aside, aren't they preparing for a banquet in the back?

1608
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,940
He's interested in eating at a time like this?!

1609
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,870
Screw you, Straw Hat!

1610
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,270
I'm a star and more experienced than you but I'm saying I'll fly under your flag!

1611
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,110
Let's force him to drink it!

1612
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,930
You don't know how strong we are,
you damn liberator!

1613
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,790
You can't talk to him like that
if you're his follower!

1614
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,570
And I'm tellin' you guys, I just wanna be Pirate King!

1615
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,070
That doesn't mean I wanna be important!

1616
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,840
Hey, what's he going on about?

1617
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,560
This is pretty good stuff.

1618
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,000
Use a cup! You have bad manners!

1619
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,790
Oh! Let me try! Give me some!

1620
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,900
Guys!

1621
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,140
When we think we're in danger,
we'll shout for you

1622
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,170
so come save us!

1623
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,550
I don't have to be the boss
or a great pirate, do I?

1624
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,800
When you guys are in trouble, call us!
We'll come help you no matter what!

1625
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,080
I'll never forget
that we fought together against Mingo!

1626
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,590
I think I'm startin' to understand what he's saying,

1627
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,490
and what it means to him to be the Pirate King!

1628
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,860
It ain't about being important...
but about bein' free!

1629
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,030
What's going on?!

1630
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,320
--Somebody's firing at us!
--Is it the Navy?!

1631
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,550
It can't be! We've sewn their warships together tightly!

1632
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,380
Let Columbus take command!
We're still busy here!

1633
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,920
--Whoever it is, get rid of them!
--Yes, sir!

1634
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,590
I know you have Monkey D. Luffy,

1635
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,570
a rookie who's worth over 100 million, on your ship!

1636
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,750
Hand him over to us without a fight!

1637
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,120
People of Dressrosa! Get back to the land!

1638
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,160
It's dangerous!

1639
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,370
But if we're not here, Fujitora will attack!

1640
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,620
Fire back!

1641
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,890
Shoot! Let them sink!

1642
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,360
The rubble's only falling where the enemy ships are!

1643
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,530
What's going on?!

1644
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,860
This is my farewell gift to you, Straw Hat.

1645
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:51,650
Freedom... Freedom...
That's what Luffy-senpai wants...

1646
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:57,430
In that case, I admire you even more, Luffy-senpai!

1647
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,160
So do I!

1648
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,410
Hey, Bartolomeo! Make the oath!

1649
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,890
He doesn't have to drink out of the parent's cup.

1650
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,020
He's right.

1651
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,230
You can do whatever you want - so can we.

1652
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,030
You can't take away our freedom, either!

1653
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,510
Oh yeah?

1654
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,050
Luffy-senpai!
Allow me to make a brief oath!

1655
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,020
An oath?

1656
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,270
Here it goes, Luffy-senpai.

1657
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,440
We now become
Straw Hat Luffy-senpai's followers,

1658
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,150
and we'll be his shield or pike in all weather!

1659
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,900
To repay him for what he did this time,
we seven will...

1660
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,300
...drink out of these Sons' Cups of our own volition,

1661
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,810
devoting our lives and souls!

1662
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,180
What are you guys doing?!

1663
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,580
This makes it official!

1664
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,220
Hurry up and prepare for the banquet!

1665
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,920
It's all ready!

1666
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,550
Celebrate the formation of the Straw Hat Fleet with over 5,600 crew in total!

1667
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,760
Yeah!

1668
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,450
They just do whatever they like!

1669
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,870
Sons' Cups?! What the hell is that?!

1670
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,750
Big Boss Straw Hat! Thank you in advance!

1671
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,270
What?!

1672
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,510
Hey! I didn't drink that, okay?!

1673
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,810
Although it's empty for some reason!

1674
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,910
Man, that was good!

1675
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,750
Yeah, that's okay!

1676
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,250
Nothing has changed for you.

1677
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,220
We just decided to go ahead
and swear our loyalty to you.

1678
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,610
And when something happens to you,
we'll be there risking our lives of our own will.

1679
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,030
You'll lose nothing by having us, right?

1680
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,690
Now, why don't you remember
our names and faces...

1681
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,050
Honey!

1682
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,670
Look.

1683
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,080
Luffy! The main dish is Fighting Fish Steak!

1684
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,320
Looks good!

1685
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,780
Hey, that's dirty! Don't climb on food!

1686
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,870
Hey, stop crying already.

1687
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:58,150
No, I can't bear to get up...
I'm so moved...

1688
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,170
Leo, we're gonna leave the port
and start the banquet.

1689
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,920
What are you guys gonna do?

1690
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,560
We're gonna attend the banquet!

1691
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,730
And we'll get home by Yellow Cubs afterwards.

1692
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,430
Don't worry about us!

1693
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,670
Are we sailing out?

1694
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,070
Okay! An order from the boss!
Hoist the sails!

1695
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,680
{\an8}Happo

1696
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,490
Vice Admiral Bastille! I have a report!

1697
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,180
The rubble's finally raining down, huh?

1698
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,260
Have Straw Hat and the others been wiped out?!

1699
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,880
No, it's all missing the target!

1700
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
What do you mean-dara?!

1701
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,420
Rubble, then sunny skies.

1702
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,450
Quite unusual weather was observed
off the coast of Dressrosa this day.

1703
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,060
I actually had no right to chase you all.

1704
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,130
I shouldn't say this out loud but...

1705
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:24,640
...thank you very much for
cleaning up the Government's mess!

1706
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,710
I heard you!

1707
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,150
Alright, guys!

1708
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,090
In the battle against the Mingo Family,

1709
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,730
we...

1710
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,100
...won!

1711
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,940
Yeah!

1712
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,840
We did it!

1713
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,810
Good job, guys!

1714
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,240
Fraland!

1715
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,850
--Zoroland, thank you!
--No problem!

1716
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,440
Crest Head!

1717
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,290
Luffy-senpai!

1718
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,860
Honey!

1719
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,930
--Let's make a toast!
--Okay!

1720
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,530
Cheers!

1721
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,480
Seems like they managed to set sail.

1722
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm glad. Lucy...

1723
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,280
Do you think we'll see them again?

1724
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,430
Isn't this warmer?

1725
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,670
Yes!

1726
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,670
It's much warmer!

1727
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,950
Oh? You're crying again!

1728
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,820
I-I'm not crying! Don't be ridiculous!

1729
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,830
Wait!

1730
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,160
Hey, come here!

1731
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,420
Stop it!

1732
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,980
Having enough?

1733
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,780
Oh, thanks!

1734
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,290
Dammit!

1735
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,290
Press and hold for more than three seconds.

1736
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,570
Cheers!

1737
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,040
Say, Robiland,
we can see you again, can't we?

1738
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,350
Of course! Along with everyone else!

1739
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,160
Yeah!

1740
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,260
--Good for you!
--Oh, when did you get in there?

1741
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,750
After the hard fight in Dressrosa,

1742
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,520
the very unconventional Sons' Cups
were exchanged in secrecy.

1743
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,420
By a quirk of fate or by chance,

1744
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,800
these seven extraordinary men gathered together

1745
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,180
and insisted on becoming Straw Hat Luffy's followers.

1746
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,130
They will develop themselves individually hereafter

1747
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,740
and will eventually cause a major incident
that will go down in history, but...

1748
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,710
...that's a story no one could have known at this time.
