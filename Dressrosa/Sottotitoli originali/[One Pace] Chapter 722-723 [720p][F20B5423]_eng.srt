The bond that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,180
We are the one! Go ahead!

You foul blooded wench!

45
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,080
Drop dead, Rebecca!

46
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,260
Today's the day you die!

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,690
You're the shame of Dressrosa!

48
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,810
Set her on fire!

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,330
That'll make up for her pyromaniac grandfather!

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,070
Who cares if she's his granddaughter?

51
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,370
She's got nothing to do with what her grandfather did.

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,980
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,560
Despite that cute face, people hate you
even more than Bartolomeo from Block B.

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,220
That's true.

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,090
That's enough!

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,970
Oh, who's entering the ring now?!

57
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,260
What an ill mannered crowd! {Best. animation. ever.}

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,500
I don't even want to look at you! { def: i messed around with the timing here }

59
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,560
Have you no shame?

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,430
{\an8}Captain of the Beautiful Pirates,
Cavendish the White Horse makes his entrance!

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,190
Cavendish-sama!

63
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,090
Ahh, what beauty!

64
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,630
Hey, get a hold of yourself! {FEELING A LITTLE INSECURE ALL THE SUDDEN, ARE WE?}

65
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,670
All the ladies in the audience are fainting! {So, why is HE blushing? SUSPICIOUS!!!!!!!}{ def: unconsious women excite him }

66
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,540
His stunning good looks
have not faded in the last three years!

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,510
Cavendish-sama, kill that girl!

68
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,110
Put Rebecca in her place!

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,310
Shut up, the lot of you!

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,650
I don't know what grudge you have against her...

71
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,020
but this young girl
is putting her life on the line by standing in this ring.

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,900
People who don't have the guts to risk their lives
have no right to judge her!

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,370
If you want to kill her so much,
then get a weapon and come into the ring!

74
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,500
The shouts of people with no resolve are nothing but background noise!

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,210
I entered this tournament for my own reasons,
but I hate these events!

76
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,550
The life of a warrior isn't something to gawk at!

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,410
Good work, Farul.

78
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,000
Why did he come here with a horse and a megaphone?

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,970
Yeah, you tell them, Cabbage!

80
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,290
Maybe you aren't all bad...

81
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,040
but I still don't like you.

82
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,940
Cavendish-sama!

83
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,280
What a beautiful person!

84
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,720
Who cares about Rebecca?!

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,450
We're rooting for you!

86
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,620
Cavendish!

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,760
What incredible charisma he has!

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,970
He turned a storm of booing into cheers!

89
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,700
Hey, I understand how you feel.

90
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,220
This probably isn't what you wanted, right?

91
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,400
It must piss you off
how easily they change their minds.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
The audience are a selfish bunch. Your speech won't really-

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm so popular!

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,900
It makes me so happy!

95
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,330
You're happy?!

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,590
It's been three years.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,830
Umm...

98
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,390
Thank you for standing up for me.

99
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,360
Don't mention it. I was genuinely disgusted by them.

100
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,310
You must have it hard.

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,140
You don't owe me anything, we are enemies now.

102
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,740
Yes.

103
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,510
That aside, there should be
a reporter or two around here somewhere.

104
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,900
I don't know what I would do
if that got into the newspaper.

105
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,140
Imagine what would happen
if they tried to interview me!

106
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,450
"Hello there, Mr. Superstar!"

107
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,490
I'd be like, "Who's Mr. Superstar?"

108
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,660
Just imagine!

109
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,100
{\an8}Now, while all that was happening,
all the participants have finished entering in the ring!

110
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,030

111
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,100

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,240
This is a battle royale between these warriors!

122
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,450
It is time for the starting gong!

123
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,330
Now then...

124
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,690
Cavendish-sama!

125
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,000
Decapitate someone, Suleiman!

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,300
Get 'em, Orlumbus!

127
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,600
Drop dead, Rebecca!

128
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,460
I hope you're seeing this, Soldier-san.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,120
Dressrosa's Flower Fields

130
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,760
Yellow Kabu and Pink Bee squads have arrived from Green Bit.

131
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,860
Good work, Leo.

132
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,330
The time has come, captain.

133
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,110
This battle is to restore the honor of King Riku, who was dethroned in shame ten years ago,{The second half of this line was originally in the line below. But since 1: this line is on screen for way longer, and 2: it matches the Japanese better this way, I moved it here. -Starfish}

134
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,440
and to regain our freedom!

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:27,650
I will never forget that man's tyranny
when he came here and stole everything!

136
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,350
We've spent a year preparing for this.

137
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,070
Even if we're up against a Warlord's crew,
we still have a chance!

138
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,200
I'll listen carefully to the plan,
and figure out the best time to run away.

139
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,380
Dressrosa "Acacia"

140
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,700
We have to turn left soon, Zoroland.

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,650
Left is the side that you don't have your swords on. {God this is awkward wording, fix please.}

142
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,150
Do you think I don't know left from right?!

143
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,810
Yes!

144
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,420
Your ship is being attacked by
a female commander of the Donquixote Family, Jora.

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,900
She uses art to incapacitate her opponents. She is quite a formidable foe.

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,670
You know a lot about her.

147
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,360
I know the names, faces and powers of all of the Family's commanders.

148
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:36,390
Especially the top three commanders who annihilated Dressrosa's army all on their own.

149
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:44,460
Trébol, Diamante and Pica.{I've noticed that there seems to be some inconsistency with whether the annoying slimey dude's name is spelled as Trebol or Trébol. For the record I believe the latter would be more accurate, unless Oda has actually specified that it's meant to be spelled the other way. (Trébol is Spanish for clover, as in the card. Likewise, Pica is Spanish for spade, so I changed that too to fit the pun.) -Starfish}
There's no way I could ever forget their faces.

150
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,070
Ten years ago?

151
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,140
Just how old are you?

152
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm 27 years old.

153
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,870
T-Twenty-seven?!

154
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,740
That's...

155
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,110
This way!

156
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,160
Zoro-dono! Zoro-dono! Over here!

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,100
Hey!

158
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,020
You're being too loud, you idiot!

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,150
Who's that? They're acting like they know us.

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,320
Swirly-Eyebrowland and Topknotland.

161
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,420
What?!

162
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,360
You're going to save Nami-san?

163
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,300
Then she really is in danger.

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,110
No wonder she wasn't picking up the Snail Phone.

165
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,020
Alright, I'm going too!

166
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,860
Wait, Sanji-dono.

167
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,880
We're here to inform Luffy-dono of the situation, remember?

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,010
Black Leg.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,980
My precious Violet-chan!

170
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,690
I hope you get passionately stabbed.

171
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,200
Your ship has been captured by Jora.

172
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
And now it's headed for Green Bit!

173
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,200
This is so much fun! { This is such a mood whiplash! -Starfish }

174
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,320
Such a beautiful marriage
between the music and art of the ocean! Yeah!

175
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,270
I like the way you talk!

176
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,940
Stop the ship!
You're not heading for Green Bit, are you?!

177
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,350
Law has quite a shock in store for him!

178
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,420
He's expecting you,
but I shall be the one who comes to fetch Caesar!

179
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,450
Brook's acting strange. How could he betray us?

180
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,300
And yet you call yourself a swordsman, Sir Bone?!

181
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,000
I have found myself!
I am an artist through and through.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,740
Creating beautiful art is what I live for!

183
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,050
...though I'm not alive.

184
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,270
Don't bother trying to explain!
These commoners will never understand, Soul King! { def: 'philistines' plays into her snooty speech, but it may be too much (originally 'commoners') }

185
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,090
Your true passion is for expressing yourself! They can never understand that.

186
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,610
Behold the Art of Life, Dying Art!

187
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,540
Simply exquisite, Jora-san!

188
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,150
Nooo!

189
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,620
Help!

190
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,720
This does not hurt!

191
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,640
You needn't say a thing! I know I have flawlessly portrayed the tragedy that occurred on Dressrosa.

192
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,560
These noisy children should merge completely with the art within ten minutes' time...

193
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,930
and then they shall be silent forever more! {Yeah, she basically just says they'll die (or literally "their breath will stop", but I tried to poetry-ify it some more because that only seems in character for her. -Starfish}

194
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,030
What?! {Is this necessary? It just sounds like a shocked noise... -Fadeout4}{Xemnas: I feel it's a bit too prominent to have nothing there.}

195
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,680
Brook!

196
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,240
Sir Bone!

197
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,790
Truly amazing! Please let me add some music!

198
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,280
If you would, Soul King.

199
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,930
Could you please restore
my violin and bow, Jora-san?

200
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,930
But of course. Now make me proud, Brother!

201
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,490
Wow! Wonderful!

202
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm starting to get sleepy.

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,360
I don't want to die!

204
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,620
Look at this, Jora-san.

205
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,900
You see,
the bow of my violin is in fact a sword in a cane.

206
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,400
I hope that it plays exquisite music.

207
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,580
Indeed. You have already been cut.

208
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,110
Hmm?  Cut?!

209
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,380
Painting Song: Bamboo Flute Joint Slice!

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,490
Painting Song

211
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,490
Bamboo Flute Joint Slice

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,590
Forgive me. I do not understand art after all.

213
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:02,280
Flute Joint

214
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,630
Because my eyes are like knotholes!{Stole this entire joke translation from FUNi because argh. -Starfish}{ def: ...just empty sockets. }

215
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,630
Knothole

216
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,370
Brook!

217
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,240
Sir Bone!

218
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,220
Green Bit

219
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,800
{\an8}Long ago...

220
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,180
{\an8}To be precise, 800 years ago, Law. {Literally "Right now it's been eight hundred years since then, Law." I omitted Law's name from the line because it's not strictly necessary and I feel it reads better without it. Though, feel free to put it back in  if you disagree, other ppls working on the script later. -Starfish} {I also hear a "Law" at the end of this... -Fadeout4}{ def: agreed, the name is obviously said.  it doesn't add anything to the line but people will notice if it isn't there }

221
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,180
Law vs.
Doflamingo and Admiral Fujitora

222
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,550
20 kings from 20 countries
assembled at the centre of the world...

223
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,690
and created a single organization.

224
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,340
That organization is now known as the World Government.

225
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:45,160
The founding kings brought their families to live in the Holy Land, Mariejoa.

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:52,140
Though the Nefertari family from Alabasta refused
so it was only 19 families...

227
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,380
but those 19 families still live there to this day
and reign over the world.

228
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,550
The descendants of those founding kings are known as the Celestial Dragons.

229
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,830
In other words, 800 years ago
those 19 countries lost their royal families.

230
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,930
Figured it out yet?

231
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,410
Naturally, those countries elected new rulers,
and new royal families were born.

232
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:27,380
Take Dressrosa for example.
The new royal family here was the Riku family.

233
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,870
Whereas the family who moved to
the Holy Land Mariejoa and founded the Government...

234
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,500
was the Donquixote family.

235
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,230
In front of Dressrosa's Corrida Colosseum

236
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,000
I was worried about Nami-san before you were!{Skimming the last episode's script, I don't THINK this dialogue was in there... But I could be wrong. -Starfish}

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,690
And she obviously would much rather I show up to help her than you!

238
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,450
That's why I'll go!

239
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,640
Fine, just go then.

240
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,550
Kin'emon. This is the map to the Toys' House,
where your friend is being held.

241
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,810
I am most grateful!

242
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,320
Once you find Luffy,
have him contact the others with this.

243
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,930
We have to know what they're doing.

244
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,240
I'm heading back to the Sunny.

245
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,060
So...

246
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,450
how are we gonna get in contact with Luffy?

247
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,850
I do not know,
and that is why we are standing here.

248
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,820
The entire building seems to be tightly sealed off...

249
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,430
I was nearly captured earlier,
so we must avoid drawing attention to ourselves.

250
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,440
I could always cut the entire wall into pieces.

251
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,360
That would definitely draw attention to us!

252
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,270
Then I'll just do it quietly and carefully.

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,880
How would that make a difference?

254
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,900
That's the Pirate Hunter Zoro-senpai!{Orgasm}{BartoRomeo-chan XD}

255
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,000
The three-sword-style user whose legend began
when he cut down a hundred men on Whiskey Peak...

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
and on Enies Lobby
they say he sliced the entire island in half!

257
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,010
And he's been supporting the crew as Luffy-senpai's right hand man!

258
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,920
He's the famous first mate of the Straw Hat Pirates!

259
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,250
He's so freaking cool!

260
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,800
Huh? My tears won't stop...

261
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,490
Dressrosa Royal Palace

262
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,490
{\an8}Gladius, you really should calm down.

263
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,900
Baby 5.

264
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,930
Do you have any idea how much
that woman's betrayal has messed up our plans?

265
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:34,340
That damn Violet was supposed to capture Black Leg Sanji and read his mind to learn the enemy's plan.

266
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,920
We were supposed to hinder their plans at every step, and take out every single one of the Straw Hats!

267
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,730
And now look what's happened!
She took out her own subordinates and ran away! {Xemnas: The word used here "Shitomete" generally implies that she killed them and as we're not sure whether she killed them or not, I used this wording which leaves it ambiguous either way as to whether she killed them or just knocked them out.}

268
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,090
Calm down!
You don't want to explode in here, do you?! {Xemnas: Isn't that ichigo's sword from bleach?}

269
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,130
There is nothing I hate more than
people who can't stay on schedule or follow a plan!

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,650
Donquixote Family (Pica Army)
Gladius

271
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,110
Anyone who betrays us...
or rather, betrays the young master, must die.

272
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,590
Violet has been acting strange ever since last night.

273
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:27,890
Just think about it. She could easily have found
the Straw Hats' ship yesterday using her Clairvoyance. { def: clairvoyance capitalized? }{Xemnas: I think it should be, since it's also the name of her ability.}

274
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,680
Northeast Dressrosa
Heading Towards Green Bit

275
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,180
Oh, Violet-chan!

276
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,960
You should have waited at the port, as we planned. {literally "the promised port" -Starfish}

277
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,790
That port is already crawling with marines.

278
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,280
You should change your rendezvous point.

279
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,390
I see, so the Navy's here.

280
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,180
They've got a total of four warships here.

281
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,330
So there are at least 3,000 marines
in this country right now.{She strictly speaking says there are at least "over three thousand", but to me the like "at least over X" sounds weird... Saying that there are at least three thousand indicates that there are probably more anyway. -Starfish}

282
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,890
How did you figure out so much on your own
in such a short amount of time?

283
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,600
Because I have the power of Clairvoyance.

284
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,510
I can send my line of sight flying like a bird
in any direction, up to 4,000 kilometers away.

285
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,060
I can see everything that happens in this country,
without lifting a finger.

286
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,600
So you don't have to worry about me.

287
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,090
I won't get captured.

288
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,620
Does that mean you're staying in the country?

289
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,790
No, don't worry.

290
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,730
I'm going to...

291
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,310
What's wrong?

292
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,310
How horrible! Your ship suddenly reappeared and was struck by lightning!

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,120
Lightning?!

294
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
Wait, that probably means...

295
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,390
Waters off Dressrosa

296
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,030
Now, what should we do with her?

297
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,700
Sir Bone, I hit her hard.

298
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,210
Indeed, your muscles are well-developed.

299
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,090
R-Really? I have strong muscles?

300
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,300
I don't really want to throw her in the ocean.

301
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,350
Since she's a Devil Fruit ability user.

302
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,220
And I have no desire to see her panties.

303
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,940
W-Who are you calling Miss Universe?

304
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,600
That's not what I said! No one said that!

305
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,540
Should I hit her once more?

306
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,130
Don't bother with her.

307
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,370
We've got to hurry to Traf.

308
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,740
But, what did he mean when he told us to pick up Caesar?

309
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,310
Listen up, you have to... {copy past from 648}

310
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,500
set sail for Green Bit right now!

311
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,970
I'm leaving Caesar in your care! {end copy paste} {Cecil: There was a mistake in that CP, which worries me XD}

312
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,020
Indeed, this is a strange situation.

313
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,870
Since Doflamingo agreed to our demands and threw away his position as a Warlord,

314
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,190
Caesar should be returned to him.

315
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,820
You guys really don't know anything.

316
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,160
There's no way the young master would take some kids' demands seriously.

317
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,130
The young master has not thrown away his position as a Warlord.

318
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,060
Wait, what do you mean by that?

319
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,840
What do you mean?

320
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,100
Ow! That hurts, you little brat!

321
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,340
Onami!

322
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,460
You've all fallen into his trap.

323
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,980
Surely by now, Violet will have exposed all your plans. You can be sure your crewmates have been caught! {Halee: How about rewording the 2d sentence as: "You can be sure your crewmates have been caught."}

324
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,180
Green Bit

325
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,130
Law vs.
Doflamingo and Admiral Fujitora

326
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
So you were a Celestial Dragon, Doflamingo?!

327
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,840
Yes, I was.

328
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,150
I'm not a Celestial Dragon anymore.

329
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,920
What do bloodlines and destiny mean anyway?

330
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,350
I don't think there is anyone else in the world who's led a life as checkered as mine.

331
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,240
I'd have loved to talk to you about my life before I met you, over a drink.

332
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,260
But I don't have the time for it.

333
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,630
I have to do something about the
Straw Hat Crew over in Dressrosa.

334
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:47,850
Many people have made the fatal mistake of underestimating them.

335
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,620
What is it, Fujitora?

336
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,200
Well...

337
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,140
I heard some lightning coming from the sea.

338
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,300
What does the sky look like? {Xemnas: He's asking if there are cumulonimbus clouds in the sky or not.} {Halee: Unless it's some speech quirk from Fujitora, it should read "What DOES the sky look like?"}

339
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,690
Lightning?

340
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,790
I may be blind, but I thought I could read the weather fairly well.

341
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,210
I guess I'm getting old.

342
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,730
If I remember, Namier could control the weather.

343
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,020
So the ship has come.

344
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,470
Hey Joker, if you've gotten it back, then hurry and give it to me!

345
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,390
My heart, my heart!

346
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,830
Hey, hurry!

347
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,540
I never said that was Caesar's heart.

348
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,070
What?!

349
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,990
That's what you used to threaten me!

350
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,840
Right now, my heart isn't inside my chest!

351
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,800
Hey, what's wrong, get a hold of yourself!

352
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,820
Hey!

353
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,770
A marine's?!

354
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,260
Then where's mine?!

355
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,400
That was my subordinate's scream.

356
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,610
What are you doing, Heavenly Demon?

357
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,710
Room!

358
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,280
You should've paid attention to your gravity, Fujitora.

359
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,410
I'm getting out of here.

360
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,440
Shambles!

361
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,330
Joker, save me!

362
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,400
I didn't think you had this much strength left, Law.

363
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,790
He doesn't know when to give up.

364
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,510
Dammit, let go of me, Law!

365
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,610
Where did you put my heart?!

366
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,600
Quit wasting my time, you brat.

367
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,920
You know there's no place to run.

368
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,760
Can you see Traf?

369
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,810
I can't see very well because of the fog.

370
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,150
Although I do see a strange forest.

371
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:29,580
If... if Traf's plan failed, and we take back Caesar, what happens?

372
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,400
Doflamingo will target us.

373
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,150
How scary!

374
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,760
What's this?!

375
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,630
What's happening?!

376
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,350
There's something in the ocean!

377
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,550
I-I-It's a school of Fighting Fish!

378
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,790
You came too close to the island!

379
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,760
What are they?

380
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,710
They're killer fish that can sink warships!

381
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,180
Onami!

382
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,230
Follow me, Doflamingo!

383
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,410
If he targets the ship, then we're out.

384
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,020
I'll draw him to the bridge, and then throw Caesar from there.

385
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:37,570
If I begin a fight with Doflamingo on top of the bridge, I can buy plenty of time for the ship to escape.

386
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,850
What's this?

387
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,990
Are you trying to cross the bridge?

388
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,130
I don't understand.

389
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,590
If you go to Dressrosa, then you're in my territory.

390
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,810
Dammit, those guys...

391
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,880
So that's what you were planning.

392
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,060
Wait, Doflamingo! They have nothing to do with this!

393
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,090
It's over, Law!

394
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,200
Doflamingo's flying toward us!

395
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Young master!

396
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,400
What is this nightmare?!

397
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,930
Are we gonna die?!

398
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,000
No!

399
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,860
Watch closely, Law.

400
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,840
Your allies are going to die a pathetic death right before your eyes!

401
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,000
Stop it!

402
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,680
Traf, hel-

403
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,020
Hey!

404
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,760
Don't come anywhere near my crying crewmates!

405
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,690
Sanji!

406
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,400
Well, here's a strong-looking one.
