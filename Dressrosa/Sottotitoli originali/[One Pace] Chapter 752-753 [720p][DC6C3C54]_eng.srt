1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,790
Fight, crash in, rise up

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are our Hard knock days

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Ordinary days won't quench our thirst

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,090
Here we go, always, don't run away

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,170
Let's go on living buffeted 
by the mighty winds

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,870
We're still far from our goal

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,690
We got to carry on Hard knock days

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,610
Let's do it again, yes, how many times, baby

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,110
do I have to get up to 
make my dream come true

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,720
Feels like the strength of my resolve is

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,420
put to the test everyday

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,690
Hey Let's go

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,460
I don't want to settle for 
small success, making excuses

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,960
Hey Let's go

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,660
The world I got out into is wild and lawless

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,180
Whiffing through the air, 
off-guard, reality countered me

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,470
Mercilessly, beat me, hit 
me, and even if I fall again

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,360
Oh

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,570
Only those who get back on 
their feet and look forward

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,820
will have the last laugh, only winner

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,120
(We gotta go, till we make 
it there, on the glory road)

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,540
Fight, shake it off, act strong

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,720
Those are our Hard knock days

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,800
A safe bet? There's no such thing

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,130
Here we go, always, be the best

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,180
and keep going without 
thinking of the consequences

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,810
Put all our wishes together

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,990
We got to carry on Hard knock days

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,630
Battle

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,220
Doflamingo!

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,370
You weaklings are working together...

32
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,880
Looks like you're gonna get those handcuffs off soon, aren't you, Law?

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,970
Why the hell are you here?!

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,420
I came to save you.

35
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,340
How could you fall into such a stupid trap? That crap about a shortcut!

36
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,720
Straw Hat!

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,220
Bullet String!

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,300
Moocy!

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,780
Give him up! Straw Hatter!

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,220
Moocy...

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,810
You have no sense of crisis...

42
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,540
Stay... with me... Moocy...

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,400
So cheesy!

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Anyone could kill you guys like this.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,980
There are some idiots who are saying they'll kill me, rampaging out there...

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,580
It's amazing how you found people who side with you under these circumstances.

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,790
I've been giving you due respect for that special quality of yours since the War of the Best.

48
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,500
But...

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,290
You're actually this dumb!

50
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,970
Why did you choose him, Law?

51
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,960
You used to be a more promising man.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,270
Even when you were a kid, you were more ruthless...

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,270
And more cunning!

54
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,250
Am I right?!

55
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,300
Who made you... into such a coward?

56
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,860
Shut up!

57
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm not willing to become like you!

58
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,880
I've been... saved!

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,470
By my brother Corazon, you mean?

60
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,080
If you haven't become a coward...

61
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,330
Why do you want to die in vain...

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,330
...alongside this dumbshit?

63
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,570
Stop! Don't hurt Straw Hat-san!

64
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,140
Get your hands off of him!

65
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,620
What the hell is this?!

66
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,310
What's wrong with his body?!

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,520
It's his clone as I thought.

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,560
Clone?

69
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,980
That's a string puppet.

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,170
You guys...

71
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,580
Straw Hat-san!

72
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,090
Glad that you're safe!

73
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,870
In any case, pull out Straw Hat-san!

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,080
You saved me... Thank you!

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,040
No, no, no, no...

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Now, is that his lower body?! What's going on with that?!

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,820
All in all, we brought down the big game, didn't we?!

78
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,150
Idiot! I told you before. That's a fake!

79
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,590
He took the trouble to send the string puppet to tease us?

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,940
Oh yeah! Actually, that Kelly Funk guy from earlier...

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,870
That bastard was fooling us!

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,200
What a simple-minded fool...
He fell into our trap completely.

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,750
We learned that and
when we tried to stop him...

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,300
We gotta do something! Abdullah, can you get up?

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,860
That infamous assassin Kelly got taken out in a split second...

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,520
If it's true, it's like we were really saved by that jerk!

87
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,790
He's mocking us!

88
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,600
What's going on out there?! How are Cabbage and the others?!

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,520
We're totally falling behind...

90
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,380
I bet everybody else reached the second level by now!

91
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,160
Damn! I thought we could take a shorter route to the Sunflower Field!

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,520
We gotta go back! Hurry up!

93
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,650
Royal Palace Plateau - Level 1

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,360
What the...?!

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,100
Rubber...

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,950
Royal Palace Plateau - Level 2

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,480
Ah! There's not a single dropout on the first level!

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,280
It's impossible!

99
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,650
Our subordinates can't match them-in!

100
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,520
Straw Hat and his group aren't here yet.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,550
Let's take them out one by one.

102
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,260
Elephant Gun!

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,200
What's that?!

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh no!

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,180
There'll be another one!

106
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,330
They don't even know what it is! How could they be freaked out by it!

107
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,600
Guys! Don't lose sight of the enemies!

108
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,150
In the Well
First Step

109
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,500
He really made a shortcut!

110
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,580
Guys! Take care of Moocy, okay?!

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,800
Yes!

112
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,060
I like this confusion!

113
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,380
Chinjao and the others are heading to the third level!

114
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,040
Stop them!

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
This big hole...

116
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,140
What the... hell is going on...

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
What's this?!

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,920
It's Straw Hat!

119
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,780
Straw Hat!

120
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,920
Trafalgar Law!

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,060
Let's get going! Straw Hatter!

122
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,240
Yeah!

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,820
Wait for me, Mingo!

124
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you serious?!

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,740
No...

126
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,570
I am serious!

127
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,450
You can't fly people with beetles!

128
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,500
Former Royal Plateau

129
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,720
Let's run through the town!

130
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
Yeah, yeah! I like her idea!

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,910
Now, let me give you instructions.

132
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,500
Aren't you even listening to us, small one?!

133
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,100
Tontatta Airlines
Yellow Cubs

134
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,510
This is Tontatta Airlines' Jumping Service!

135
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,360
Big Humans are too heavy so they can't bear you!

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,090
See, we told you!

137
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,160
We don't have that much time,

138
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
so just take off!

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,330
What?!

140
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,870
We told you we can't fly like this!

141
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,070
Leo, don't push them too far!

142
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,710
Hey, are you alright?!

143
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,160
Damn! Little People! I'll pay you back for this!

144
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,790
Am I... flying?!

145
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,530
They can't fly you but they can slow you down when you fall!

146
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm falling! I'm falling! I'm falling!

147
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,530
Relax!

148
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,960
How can I relax?! I'm gonna crash into something!

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,060
Head for a rooftop!

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,100
A rooftop?!

151
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,380
That's right! And land on it smoothly!

152
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Now! Kick off!

153
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm flying!

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,100
Kicking off rooftops helps you to rise!

155
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
I see!

156
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm getting the knack of it!

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,000
Good! You're doing great!

158
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,300
I feel like I'm a balloon!

159
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,860
Watch out for attacks from below.

160
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,190
Level 4
The Sunflower field

161
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,190
Head for the Sunflower Field on the fourth level, everybody!

162
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,200
Roger that!

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,360
Roger that!

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,600
Got it!

165
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,220
In front of the SMILE factory

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,210
Fraland!

167
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,460
We have an idea to unlock the door to the Factory!

168
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,340
What?! Really?!

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,360
Yes! So please keep Senor busy like that!

170
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,110
I got it!

171
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,900
Count on me!

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,050
On Top of Pica's Statue

173
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,450
You asshole! You just stepped on my sword!

174
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,580
So what?

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,560
In Town
 Sabo vs. Fujitora

176
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,220
What a fight!

177
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,750
The Palace

178
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,360
Hey hey, Doffy!

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,590
Did you send String-Joker off somewhere?

180
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,300
I wanted to deliver something but I guess he doesn't need it.

181
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,230
You guys...

182
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,240
Do you remember the day we met Law for the first time?

183
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,030
He was nuts!

184
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,180
Even his eyes were crazy...

185
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,940
Yeah, yeah!

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,520
He looked like me when I was a kid.

187
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,340
I sensed he would become my right-hand man in 10 years or so.

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,790
It's a shame that I will have to kill him with my own hands.

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,310
We have an intruder!

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,940
Don't touch him!
He has explosives strapped to his body!

191
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,240
Hey! Who the hell is this kid?!
Who let him in?!

192
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Let me join your pirate group.

193
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,810
I wanna destroy everything that I see!

194
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,240
Towns, houses, people...
I wanna destroy them all!

195
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,100
I...

196
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,100
...grew up in the White Town - Flevance.

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,700
It's not so long...

198
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,760
...before I die.

199
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,080
Mingo!

200
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,070
Dressrosa
Within the Birdcage

201
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,010
I'm feeling sentimental now...

202
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,330
The Royal Palace

203
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,620
What did you come here for?

204
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,330
Pirate Bellamy the Hyena
Bounty: 195 million Belly

205
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,320
Did you kill Straw Hat, Bellamy?

206
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:39,740
Why did you send Dellinger to kill me?!
Was it really your order?!

207
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,160
Oh boy... What rubbish...

208
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,310
Isn't there any...

209
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,580
...hope left for me?

210
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,460
Don't make me say it straight, Bellamy.

211
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,480
Your purpose was different from mine.
From long ago.

212
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,600
You always wanted to become a pirate.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,580
But not me.

214
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,490
Anything was fine with me.

215
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,220
Anything?

216
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,480
As long as I could...

217
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,940
...destroy this world!

218
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,910
Royal Palace Plateau - Level 2








Colosseum Army vs. the Donquixote Family

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,990
Get out of my way, kid!

220
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,130
I'm in a rush!

221
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,020
Hey, what do I look like?

222
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,580
Hey, tell me, Suleiman!

223
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,860
You used to be a war executioner, right?!

224
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,460
I love... executing people!

225
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
Kicks!

226
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,600
Oh no... That's too bad.
It's over already.

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,990
Here come the Executives of the Family!

228
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,720
Alright! I'm gonna get to the third level first!

229
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,860
What are these bulging stones?

230
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,710
That place is dangerous.

231
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,740
Mine... pop!

232
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,190
Grandpa! I'm coming!

233
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,370
Da-in!

234
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,570
Floaty, floaty...

235
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,800
Ten-Ton Vise!

236
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
You see it, idiots?!

237
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,760
That's how powerful our Family's Executives are!

238
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,200
He did it!

239
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
They can't go any farther!

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,030
I got you!

241
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,090
Armsmorphosis!

242
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,570
Revolver Leg!

243
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,390
The Town in the South - Sevio

244
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,190
I got him!

245
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,480
Bring the rope now!

246
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,780
And treat him! He's been shot!

247
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,000
The rest of you, put out the fire!

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,280
Okay!

249
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,310
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Thank you!

250
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,020
I almost killed my family!

251
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,460
It was me who set the town on fire! I'm sorry!

252
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,190
I sliced up my own friend!

253
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,570
Me, too! Dammit!

254
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,710
It's not your fault.

255
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,550
Everything happened because of Doflamingo's meddling!

256
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,560
We gotta bring an end to this game somehow...

257
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,380
Hey!

258
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,940
We found out where King Riku is!

259
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,160
He's with the Five-star God Usopp!

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,040
Alright... Let's do it!

261
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,500
But we only capture them!

262
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay?

263
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,990
Yeah, if we don't do it, this game will last until we die!

264
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,970
First, take King Riku and God Usopp as hostages.

265
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,220
And lure other criminals using those hostages!

266
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,020
Tell the people all over the country!

267
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,750
Head for Old King's Plateau!

268
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,510
Yeah!

269
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,150
Yeah!

270
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,760
SMILE Factory

271
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,230
Interior

272
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,920
Did you knock over this SAD tank?!

273
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,390
Pick it up!

274
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,580
Are you okay?!

275
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,460
Please stop! There was a sudden earthquake

276
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,310
and the tank got knocked over!

277
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,440
He's right!

278
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,540
What caused that earthquake?!

279
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,400
Shut up! You guys don't need to worry about it!

280
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,200
But!

281
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,860
Don't you guys wanna cure Princess Mancherie's illness?!

282
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,920
I bet you do!

283
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,160
Of course, we wanna cure it!
How is she doing?!

284
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,120
Huh?

285
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,150
Um...

286
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm afraid the princess isn't getting better at all!

287
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,060
At all!

288
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,400
What?!

289
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
Please! Let us see the princess!

290
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,580
Oh, damn! What a pain!

291
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,900
Shut up and work!

292
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,700
Is that...

293
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,320
You fools, just stop grumbling and keep making SMILEs!

294
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,290
{\an8}From inside, Unlock...

295
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,720
What are you guys doing?!
I said work, idiots!

296
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,420
{\an8}From inside, Unlock...

297
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,120
Quit zoning out! Can't you hear me?!

298
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,970
{\an8}...The door!

299
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,240
Those words...

300
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,590
{\an8}...The door!

301
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,520
It's the Pink Bees!

302
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Bian!

303
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,100
Inhel! Wicca!

304
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,530
They noticed us! Bian!

305
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,980
Roger that!
Pink Bees, the next message!

306
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,610
{\an8}We got fooled!!!

307
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,410
What? "We got fooled"?

308
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,880
What do they mean?

309
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,910
Hey, you guys! Can't you hear us?!

310
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,800
We got fooled?
Is it about the princess' illness?

311
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,540
Doflamingo has been fooling us?

312
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,170
{\an8}Fight!!!

313
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,540
I guess you need another beating to understand things.

314
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,520
I don't know what's going on
but one thing I know is...

315
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,380
Friends don't lie!

316
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,680
Shut up!

317
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,250
Sanshita!

318
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,330
Royal Palace Plateau- Level 2

319
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,960
Straw Hat!

320
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,790
Cabbage!
Do you wanna get in my way, again?!

321
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,460
No...

322
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Get on.

323
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,590
What?

324
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,540
I mean I'll give you a ride because I have no other choice!

325
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,830
You sure?!

326
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,420
You wanna get to Doflamingo ASAP, don't you?

327
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,860
Alright!

328
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,700
I'm ready! Go!

329
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,180
Have you ever once in your life been humble?!

330
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,320
Whatever, just go!

331
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,150
Don't tell me what to do!

332
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,860
Let's go, Farul!

333
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,120
Listen, if we get caught by the Executives, we get stuck here.

334
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm gonna cut the wall and make a path so you kick the other enemies' asses!

335
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,240
Got it!

336
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,990
And we're gonna go straight to the third level...

337
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,840
Hey! That's one too many!
Who are you?!

338
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Oh, Soldier!

339
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,980
When did you get on?!

340
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,840
Just now!

341
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,750
I followed the path that Luffyland made!

342
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,340
You followed too far!

343
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,480
Great! I was looking for you!

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,420
Even if you're his friend, we're overloaded! Get off!

345
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,000
We're gonna meet up with Rebecca!

346
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,740
Rebecca is in this enemy territory?!
Why didn't you stop her?!

347
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,260
Listen to me!

348
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,440
We'll rendezvous at the Sunflower Field on the fourth level.

349
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,140
She's on the criminal list, too!

350
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,880
Don't worry! She's with my friends!

351
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,530
Listen! My dear horse Farul can only run beautifully with two people or less!

352
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,030
The bull's back had more space...

353
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,570
By the way, pops,
why did you take off before I knew it?

354
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,700
Whatever the situation is...
What I have to do is...

355
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,440
...bring down Doflamingo
and take back the country!

356
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,780
But there's one more thing!

357
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,300
There's one man in the Family's Top Executives that I wanna kill with my own bare hands at any cost!

358
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,030
Old dude, you're not willing to die, are you?

359
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,140
No way! I won't be defeated with this human body!

360
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,280
Alright, then!

361
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,860
Nothing's alright! Get off!

362
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,240
Huh?! You get off!

363
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,620
That's nonsense! You're the worst!

364
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,540
You really are part of the Worst Generation!

365
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,290
Watch out, fool!
Look where you're going! Hey!

366
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,680
Like I said, don't tell me what to do!

367
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,620
What?!

368
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,200
Is that...

369
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,370
Go ahead, Straw Hat!

370
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,550
We're gonna keep them busy!

371
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,650
What-in?! They're suddenly...

372
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,720
They were disorganised before, fighting each other!

373
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,190
What?! Why are you doing this, guys?!

374
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,150
I am Dagama, the military technician!
This is war!

375
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,320
Even if we all run wild blindly, no one can reach the top!

376
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,330
I don't trust Dagama but I agreed to his plan to keep the Executives here and let Straw Hat go ahead!

377
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,770
Leave this mess here to us and go!

378
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,740
Make sure to take him there, Cavendish!

379
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,730
Hey, hey! I'm not public transportation!

380
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,960
We gotta win this war!

381
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,010
Way to go!

382
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,480
Looks like that guy is taking command.

383
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,190
He's annoying!

384
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,560
Daruma!

385
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,920
What the... Hey, let go off me!
You jerk!

386
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,940
Get to the top! Straw Hat!

387
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,700
Shoot, shoot!

388
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,240
Keep them off at any price!

389
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,460
Blade of Beauty! Saint-Exupéry!

390
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,460
{\an8}Blade of Beauty: Stardust Prince

391
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,200
Rubber Jet Gatling!
