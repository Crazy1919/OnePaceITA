Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,670
Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

Was that a devil fruit ability?

46
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,530
Probably, but what type of ability was it?

47
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm very sorry for the trouble.

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,460
You can send the request for compensation to this address.

49
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,050
Uh, I see...

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,750
What?!

51
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,600
Sir, are you...?!

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,310
Excuse me.

53
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,910
You're really strong, old guy!  Who are you?

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,720
It would seem...
that it'd be better for the both of us if I didn't tell you.

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,090
Hey!  Why don't you watch where you're going?!

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,360
I-I'm very sorry.  Are you hurt?

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,440
Better for the both of us?
Is he like, some really infamous guy?

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,340
Whoever he is, he's definitely trouble.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,160
My bag's gone!

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,580
And my watch!

61
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,450
Where'd my wallet go?!

62
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,380
Damn it!  My jacket's been stolen!

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,280
Even though it's midday,
they still managed to sneak in through the dust!

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,090
Did the old guy pickpocket everyone, or something?

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,460
One of them is missing!

66
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,920
What do you mean?

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,230
One of my swords is gone!

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,450
Shuusui was right here!

69
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,030
What?!  The treasure of the Wano Country?!

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
It seems everyone's been had.

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,420
The fairies stole them.

72
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,210
What's that supposed to mean?!
Is it some sort of criminal organization?

73
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,310
Fairies are fairies.
You just have to laugh and accept what they do.

74
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,140
The fairies cannot be seen, but they have been the guardians of Dressrosa for generations.

75
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,320
We must turn a blind eye to whatever they do.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,560
Guess there's nothing for it.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,540
You gotta be kidding me!

78
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,760
Indeed!
That is a national treasure of the Wano Country!

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,750
What?!  It's my sword!

80
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,490
It does not belong to you!

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,150
Sooner or later I will fight you for the blade and return it to its rightful home!

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,980
Suits me fine!  I'll just take you down!

83
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,110
Your greed was your downfall, fairies!

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,600
You're not getting away from me!

85
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,480
Hey Zoro, Where are you going!?

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,900
Hold it!

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,540
We don't have time to let you wander off on your own!

88
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,220
Looks like fun.

89
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,160
Not so fast, Luffy.

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,980
Have you found the culprit?!

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,650
I will not let you run off
with one of the Wano Country's treasures!

92
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,290
Let go of me!  I want to go too!

93
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,920
I've got a great idea. { edit: I just realized something. }

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,500
Idea?

95
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:42,000
I've come to realize that, in this group,
I have to take the lead or nothing will get done.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Just leave it to me, the bro-meister.

97
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,470
You're one of Doflamingo's men, aren't you?

98
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,120
Is that supposed to scare us?

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,000
We asked you a question, mister.  Better spill the beans.

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,200
I-I already told you!

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah, I remember chasing the samurai, but I have no idea how he was captured or where he is now.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,540
And I've never heard of this Smile-thing before.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,660
Not even the letter S in Smile?

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,680
Nothing at all!
And that goes for this factory of yours too!

105
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,760
What are you talking about?!

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,410
Well, this ain't good.
Even his own men don't know, huh?

107
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,560
Then tell us where we can find someone who gives you orders!

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,410
This guy might just be too low in their ranks.

109
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,240
I have no idea where anybody is today.
Everyone's too busy.

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,750
Even I've been called to the colosseum.

111
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,000
Look.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,150
People from all over the country
are heading to the colosseum today.

113
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,330
The Corrida Colosseum.
If you wanna find the higher-ups, go there.

114
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,000
Today's a special event.

115
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,800
The Family's commanders are probably gonna be there.

116
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,070
I dunno the details,
but the young master's prepared a spectacular prize.

117
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,650
I couldn't believe it when I found out.

118
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,880
It's something anyone would want.

119
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,170
You don't mean...

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,050
that ultra-delicious meat
that Mingo was talking about?!

121
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,570
He only said that it was something you'd want.

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,100
{\an8}Ow!

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,160
Dressrosa's Corrida Colosseum

124
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,160
{\an8}It's him!  The Thunder Soldier!

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,260
Ladies, gentlemen and toys...

126
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,640
That hurts!

127
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,330
We wanna see too!

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,300
Let us in!

129
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,960
Children are not allowed to watch people fight to the death!

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,020
Go home!

131
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,500
The event today...

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,110
will be a truly special occasion!

133
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,840
For this day, the King has granted us...

134
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,850
a priceless gem!

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,190
Two years ago, at the Great War at Marineford...

136
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,790
a man lost his life.

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,450
He was second commander of the legendary Whitebeard Pirates, and the son of the Pirate King.

138
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,300
Ace!

139
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,010
They say his fists of flame could pierce warships...

140
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,190
or burn cities to the ground
and turn them into a living hell!

141
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,170
This formidable power has returned to the world.
Reborn in the form of a new Devil Fruit!

142
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,920
R-Reborn?

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
Seriously?!

144
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,420
Behold!

145
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,430
This forbidden fruit
will be given to the victor of today's battle!

146
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,270
One of the Logia Devil Fruits,
the strongest of the three varieties!

147
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,600
The Flame Fruit!

148
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,200
Is that true?

149
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,800
The young master
would never lie about something like this!

150
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,120
Ace's...

151
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,050
Flame Fruit?

152
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,170
Today our colosseum will be host to...

153
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,240
great men from all parts of the New World
who have been summoned by our King.

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,910
However!  This gem will not be handed over easily.

155
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,480
If anyone thinks they can steal it,
I'd like to see them try!

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,850
It is being guarded by people far more powerful
than our usual combatants.

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,350
Namely...

158
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,680
members of the esteemed Donquixote Family!

159
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,480
Senor Pink!

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,670
Dellinger!

161
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,310
Lao G!

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,570
Machvise!

163
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,990
Vise!

164
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,350
And last but not least, the hero of our colosseum...

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,830
Mr. Diamante!

166
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,230
Diamante-sama!

167
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,520
Diamante!

168
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,510
Let's get this thing started!

169
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,500
Let's see some blood!

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,990
What... is Ace's Flame Fruit doing here?

171
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,930
Each devil fruit is unique
and no two have the same power.

172
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,190
But when a devil fruit user dies,

173
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,110
the fruit that holds that power will reappear again somewhere in the world.

174
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,330
And whoever eats the new fruit
will become the next holder of its power.

175
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,350
After Fire Fist Ace died,
the Flame Fruit reappeared somewhere unnoticed.

176
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,050
Until the young master managed to find it!

177
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,920
He's giving away a Logia devil fruit as a prize for his business.

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,870
The young master is much more generous than he needs to be.

179
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm sure my life would be changed if I could gain that amazing power.

180
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,330
Like hell I'd let you eat it!

181
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,540
Oh yeah, Ace was your...

182
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,370
I want that Flame Fruit!

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,510
Oh, I know!  Why don't you eat it, Franky?

184
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,110
I'd rather not become an anchor. { def: dude, you're like 60% metal already.  how much swimming are you doing? }

185
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,890
I've already eaten the Rubber Fruit,
so I can't eat another one...

186
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,690
but I don't want some random stranger to run off with Ace's power!

187
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,300
So it's like a memento for you?

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,600
Thinking of what Doflamingo said,
this is probably a trap.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,380
All I'll say is...

190
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,750
Don't let this chance slip away!

191
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,040
You'd just end up regretting it.

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,830
Besides, we've got business at the colosseum anyway.

193
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,620
So let's go.

194
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,420
You fools.

195
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,810
If wanting it was all it took,
nobody would lose their lives there.

196
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,730
You underestimate the danger of the colosseum.

197
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,290
Mysterious Fairy Pursuit

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,830
Fairy, my ass!  He's just some thief!

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,200
I keep telling you to wait!

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,860
Surely you can lose a sword.  Or two!

201
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,850
Like hell I can, you damned idiot!

202
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,850
Dammit! Where did he go?

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,130
What's that?

204
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,480
Did you find the fairy?

205
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,390
Dancer
Violet

206
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,370
Such sweetness!

207
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,610
Such passion!

208
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,850
No one in the world can match your dancing! {Xemnas: No one in the world can match the laziness of that animation.}

209
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,050
What?

210
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,110
Sh-

211
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,630
She's so beautiful!

212
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,660
Have you forgotten
that women in this country stab men to death?

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,330
You're just gonna wind up dead.

214
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,110
I'd gladly let her stab me!

215
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,310
Shit!  I lost sight of him!

216
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,480
That Moss-Head got himself lost!

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,290
Right, this is an excellent opportunity.

218
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,510
Let's just leave him here.
He's nothing but trouble anyway.

219
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,370
I did everything I could.

220
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,700
Looks like this place is filled with couples.
I'm really jealous.

221
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,290
I wonder if this place would make
Nami-san and Robin-chan hopelessly fall for me?

222
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,720
Hello, you there!

223
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,320
You're the one who was looking at me earlier, right?

224
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,640
Please...

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,410
hold me in your arms!

226
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,330
Whaaat?!

227
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,250
Where did she run off to?

228
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,700
She must have snuck out the back door into Lovers' Avenue.  She can't be far!{Good thing they aren't just doing a full 360 around on their immediate surroundings. I think they would probably have spotted her. -Starfish}

229
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,240
Don't let her get out of the city!

230
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,280
Yes sir! { def: does this count as translating?  cause if it does i think i could be a translator } {Xemnas: lol}

231
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,940
Thank you.  It looks like they're gone.

232
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,590
Umm...

233
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,690
you can let go now.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,060
Oh, you are very welcome.

235
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm so sorry!  Did you hit your head?

236
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,310
No, the only thing that has hit me is the impact of our meeting.

237
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,410
But there's so much blood!{Dear anime-creators everywhere. THAT IS NOT WHERE THE BLOOD GOES WHEN ONE IS TURNED ON. SRSLY. WHERE DID THAT STEREOTYPE EVEN COME FROM. -Starfish} {Xemnas: That's Japan for you. If you ever come across something weird, 99% of the time it originated in Japan.}

238
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,480
No... it's nothing.

239
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,680
Poor you.

240
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,280
It's no use!  I cannot resist this passion!

241
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,640
No, you mustn't look at me like that!

242
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,860
I have forsaken love.

243
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,920
Every man I've gotten involved with-

244
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,730
I know!

245
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,570
They were all in paradise!

246
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,370
You were being chased, right?  Who were those people?

247
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,810
If there's anything I can do to help, just tell me!

248
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,080
That was the police.

249
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,690
I... stabbed a man to death...

250
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,290
because our love had turned sour.

251
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,050
What?!

252
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,010
You mean it's true?!  Women in this country really are passionate enough to kill?!

253
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,950
Okay!

254
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,740
You're okay with that?!

255
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,150
What's wrong?

256
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,110
No, you can't just forgive a demonic woman like me!

257
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,080
Or I might...

258
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,720
fall in love with you.

259
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,480
My name is Violet.

260
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,950
Would you be so kind
as to escort me to the next town?

261
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,020
And once there...

262
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,630
will you kill a man for me?

263
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,100
Corrida Colosseum

264
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,100
{\an8}The colosseum is enormous!

265
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,240
Just listen to those cheers!
Suddenly, I wanna participate too.

266
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,990
They're really getting fired up.

267
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,110
You've caused so much trouble!

268
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,000
Just give up already!

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,780
Criminal toy soldier!

270
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,440
No good!  You can't hit me!

271
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,470
Jet Walk!

272
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,800
Look, my dear slugs!

273
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,900
{\an8}I have entered the colosseum!

274
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,170
One-legged soldier
 Alternate Name: The Mad Thunder Soldier

275
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,410
{\an8}You know the law, don't you?

276
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,910
Cops and marines
are forbidden to enter the colosseum!

277
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,680
Even if you see criminals within the colosseum, you have no authority here!

278
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,110
The only law that applies in here
is the law of the Donquixote Family!

279
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,420
Pull those triggers, and you will be the criminals!

280
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,730
Now get out of my sight!

281
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,670
Dammit.

282
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,600
Oh, pardon me old man!
Shall I carry your luggage for you?

283
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
What's this?  He sure got real polite all of a sudden.

284
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,320
What a funny soldier!

285
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,210
You find me funny?

286
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,620
How about this?  How about this?

287
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,320
Could you step aside, pops?

288
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,060
Oh, am I in your way?  How terribly rude of me!

289
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,940
You're blushing like crazy!

290
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,300
You're really serious, huh?

291
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,860
N-Not at all!

292
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,580
Making people smile is a toy's duty!

293
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,570
As if there could ever be such a thing as a serious toy!

294
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,710
He's taking it personally!{...I will admit, I am not sure I fully understand this conversation =/ -Starfish}

295
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,180
The open sign-up for today's battle
is about to close.

296
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,280
Not that any commoners
would want to participate, anyway.

297
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,090
They're too scared.

298
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,300
Hey, Luffy.  Looks like that's your entrance over there.

299
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,730
Oh, I see.

300
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,330
Alright, I'm participating!  Sign me up!

301
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,550
I'll fight!

302
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,820
Huh? Does that old man want to enter?

303
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,230
Is he nuts?

304
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,510
Does he have any idea what he's doing?!

305
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,900
Hey Luffy, listen. Promise me just one thing.

306
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,440
You can go all out if you want but don't ever let them know who you are.

307
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,620
Okay!

308
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,980
Sign your name.

309
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,320
Luf...

310
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,260
You idiot!

311
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,950
Fighter Number 556 - Lucy

312
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,060
This is the dressing room for the competitors.

313
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,890
You're free until we call you.

314
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,180
Wow! It's so exciting!

315
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,660
The Flame Fruit is mine!

316
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,540
No, it's mine, idiot!

317
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,120
Hey, who's the little guy?

318
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,730
I see.

319
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,020
Can we use any weapons we like?

320
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,780
Hey, who is he?

321
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,650
Oh, he's the last participant to sign up.

322
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,260
What's this shrimp doing here?

323
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,840
{\an8}This is the worst kind of joke!

324
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,230
Spartan
Corrida Colosseum Gladiator (51 Time Winner of the Monthly Tournament)

325
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,540
Hey, fake-bearded brat! This is a fighting arena!

326
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,110
Don't, Spartan!

327
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,080
It's no fun seeing a weakling get pummeled!

328
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,820
The spectators only get excited when the strong go head-to-head!

329
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,860
This is not a place for you! Go home!

330
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,900
Go home now!

331
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
Nice to meet ya'!
