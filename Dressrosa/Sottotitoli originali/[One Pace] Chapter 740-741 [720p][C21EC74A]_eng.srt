00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,930
Let's go! Shining! Running! Forever!

00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,700
Keep pushing forward!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
The bond that joins us will never break

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,670
and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,340
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,300
We are the one! Go ahead!

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070
Freedom is our only compass we need. -We are best friends-

Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,920
A chain of excitements!

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,490
That's right! Shining! Running! Forever!

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,230
Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,700
and head for your goal, that's what adventure is all about!

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Let's go shining! Running! Forever!

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Spread open the chart of your dreams!

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,170
There's power hidden in the bond between us,

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,290
it'll help us grasp the end of our dreams.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,960
Never! Never! Never! Never stop it!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,160
We are the one! Go ahead!

29
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,470
The Royal Palace Floor B-1
(Outer Wall Tower)

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,780
Usoland the Liar

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,660
There are dead ends all over the place.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,230
I told you, Pica has complete control over this stone castle.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,140
Straw Hat, will he really be okay?

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,220
Huh? Zoro?

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,070
You don't need to worry about him.

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,580
Zoro'll be fine no matter what happens.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,780
On the same floor –
Zoro vs. Pica

38
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,720
He's still undamaged.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,440
This guy just won't quit!

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,160
How do I even attack him?

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,660
The Royal Palace
First Floor –
The Soldier and
the Dwarves

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,100
Captain! It's another officer!

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,370
That's Gladius from the Pica Army!

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,770
You don't stand a chance as you are now.

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,840
Ranpo and I will distract him.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,210
Keep moving while he's occupied!

47
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,880
Stop! Do you plan to sacrifice yourselves?

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Ranpo!

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,520
Let's attack from both sides, Kabu-san!

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,500
Yes!

51
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,450
Wait!

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,760
Why do I have to fight these mice?

53
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,270
Kabu!

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,530
Ranpo!

55
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,490
I know toys aren't that fast.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm a rupture man who ate the Pamu Pamu Fruit.{rupture? puncture? I'M SO CONFUSED! -Kae}

57
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,580
I can make my own body burst...

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,050
as well as...

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,480
any non-organic material I touch.

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,060
I can easily blow a tin toy like you to smithereens!

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Let go of me!

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,390
I have to...

63
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,800
fulfill my mission!

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,070
Rebecca!

65
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,510
Rupture and die!

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,680
Jet Stamp!

67
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,550
Who's there?!

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,460
Soldier, where are Franky and the others?

69
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,890
You're...

70
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,990
What, they're not with you?

71
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,060
Straw Hat, we don't have time to chat!

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,300
Straw Hat Luffy?

73
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,300
Violet?!

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,880
How dare you...

75
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,510
How dare you betray the young master!

76
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,940
Bring it on!

77
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,240
No, run!

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,010
What?

79
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,050
There's no time. Besides, he's exceedingly dangerous.

80
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,350
We have to hurry to the Suit Chamber on the second floor!

81
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,690
Viola-sama, why are you here?

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,390
You know me?

83
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,760
Yes, though you don't remember me.

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,830
I've been watching you with my Clairvoyance the whole time.

85
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,930
Both you and Rebecca.

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,070
It must have been hard for you. Thank you.

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,410
Violet!

88
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,040
You, traitorous woman...{I did some very liberal editing to make up for the discrepancy between the length of the text and the length of the audio. I hope it is acceptable. -Kae}{Xemnas: Translation wise I don't see any problem with this, it still conveys the same meaning.}

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,180
must die! {Literally "I will never forgive traitors," but that sounds kinda weak in English. -Starfish}

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,850
I haven't betrayed anyone!

91
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,250
These past ten years, I've never once been on your side!

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,020
Still, you've disgraced the young master!

93
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,490
Helmet Puncture!

94
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,800
Viola-sama!

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,500
Oh no!

96
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,070
Hey, you're gonna be okay, aren't you?

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,510
Sorry, I should have protected you.

98
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,680
I just have to keep going, right?

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,580
Wait!

100
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,280
The stairs aren't this way!

101
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,350
What?!

102
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,450
Where are you going?!

103
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,820
Up there, right?

104
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,160
Where did they go?

105
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,030
Young master? What are you doing here?

106
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,740
Kin'emon In Disguise
Donquixote Doflaemon

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,640
"Young master"?

108
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,740
I am Donqui-

109
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,180
They call Doflamingo "young master"!

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,080
I am the young master.

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,710
There are intruders in the palace.

112
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,420
Please wait upstairs until we dispose of them.

113
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,190
No, that I cannot do.

114
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,560
You take care of things here.

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,760
I must go check on Kanjuurou below.

116
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,890
The samurai who vanished from the scrap yard?

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,100
What?

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,330
He vanished?!

119
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,100
A-Amazing! We're right in front of our goal!

120
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,100
Royal Palace Second Floor
The Suit Chamber

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,340
Why are we hiding?

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,540
Mingo's right there!

123
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,440
Be quiet.

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,280
You'll ruin their entire operation.

125
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,380
Operation?

126
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,220
I thought you were only after the Smile factory.

127
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,820
Isn't that right?

128
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,460
So why are Straw Hats and the dwarves from Green Bit working together?

129
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,700
That's not an alliance you could have just formed on a whim one day.

130
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,930
Dwarves?

131
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,500
How did they get underground?

132
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,280
Why are they after Sugar?

133
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,250
What is the meaning of their actions?

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,650
All these inconveniences are piling up on top of each other.

135
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,390
Unless this is a coincidence, then they...

136
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,630
must know the dark roots of this kingdom.

137
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,910
Answer! The young master asked you a question, Law!

138
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,050
Don't hit him if it makes you cry -dasuyan.

139
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,880
You never change.

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
But...

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,050
Didn't I tell you?

142
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,460
They have nothing to do with me anymore.
Our alliance is broken.

143
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,960
I don't even understand most of what you're talking about.

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,910
If only Violet were with me for this interrogation. She could get the truth out of you immediately.

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
Or...

146
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,320
This can't be your doing, can it, King Riku?

147
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,190
The Tontattans used to serve you too.

148
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,840
Father, what are you doing in the palace?

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,960
Traf is still alive.

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,300
King Riku! It's so good to see you safe after all these years!

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,210
Your name is Kyros? Come with me.

152
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,980
I swear I'll save you!

153
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,780
Aren't Leo and the others done yet?

154
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,720
Once I and the other toys in Dressrosa return to human form...

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,360
that will be my only chance to kill Doflamingo!

156
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,940
I will kill him!

157
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,700
I can't let Kabu and Ranpo's sacrifice be in vain!

158
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,170
I'm counting on you, Leo and Usoland!

159
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,610
Toys' House

160
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,340
Give it up, Franky!

161
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,140
Stop resisting and turn yourself in!

162
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,250
Shut up.

163
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,750
Shut the hell up!

164
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,730
I've decided to go on a pointless rampage, so prepare yourselves.

165
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,270
If I went underground with these guys after me, I'd get in the dwarves' way.

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll leave Operation SOP to you guys.

167
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,110
Bring it on!

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,220
I'll take on these guys.

169
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,980
I'm counting on you, Usoland. {Halee: Infobox at 10:37.}

170
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,890
Underground Trading Port –
Remains of the Officers' Tower

171
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,220
What on earth is going on over there?

172
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,850
Apparently there's an intruder.

173
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,820
But we've got Trebol-sama on our side.

174
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,060
I feel bad for them, but they don't stand a chance against him.

175
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,470
They just keep getting back up. {Xemnas: I wanted to go with "These guys just don't know when to quit." but I thought that kind of phrasing might be out of character for him, what do you guys think?}{I agree. He seems kind of slow. I don't see him rolling off witty lines. -Kae}

176
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,510
I let my guard down and was made into a toy.

177
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,650
That means that everyone must have forgotten about me.

178
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,550
Usopp...

179
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,960
Where's Usopp?

180
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You can do it, Usopp.

181
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,330
You're the only one left.

182
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,560
Turn me back into a human.

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,170
They were trying so hard to make me eat this.

184
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,900
It's probably poison.

185
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,340
It stinks.

186
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,810
W-We can't do anything anymore.

187
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Don't worry! If anything goes wrong, I'll save you! {copy past from 671}

188
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,180
Usoland.

189
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,450
Move it!

190
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,190
Where are you going, buddy?

191
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,820
Alright, I've successfully escaped!

192
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,030
Forgive me, Tontattans.

193
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,430
Usopp, where are you? {Xemnas: She says "where... where are you?" but I felt the first "where" is unnecessary since it's not a pause but the whole Japanese repeat a word for a stronger effect thing.}

194
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,620
Okay, I'll write of your bravery in a
 picture book for future generations.

195
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,740
"The Trusting Tontattans." That's a good title.

196
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,570
I must live on. {Xemnas: He sounds like a total ass here. Very disappointing Usopp.}{yup.}{ Yet another reason he's my least favorite crewmember. }

197
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,180
Besides, this is all Franky's fault.

198
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,840
Why won't he come help?

199
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,180
Like hell I'm dying for the sake of pretending to be a hero!

200
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,560
Now that I've escaped, how do I get out of here?

201
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,690
I can't use the hole we came in from on my own.

202
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,460
Wait, they said there's a port.

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,030
Hey, everyone outside!

204
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,000
Hey, hey, are you guys working?

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,570
This isn't some show, you bastards!

206
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,600
Oh crap!

207
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,310
Get back to work!

208
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,150
Keep moving those crates!

209
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,180
Don't just stand there!

210
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,980
Hurry the hell up!

211
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,120
Is someone standing up to the Donquixote Family?

212
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,860
It's been eight years since I became a toy, and this is a first.

213
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,030
I don't care who, but please destroy this place!

214
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,670
A show?! I've seen enough of it!

215
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,500
What are we gonna do about them?

216
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,540
Hey, hey, are these guys saying something?

217
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,150
Uso...

218
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,040
... la...

219
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,320
... nd.

220
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,690
... land.

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,590
Usoland.

222
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,760
Usola...

223
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,430
Usoland.

224
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,360
Dammit, where's the lift?!

225
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,270
Usoland.

226
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,700
Usoland.

227
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,240
Usoland.

228
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,980
Usoland?

229
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,780
That's the name he said before.

230
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,790
Usoland... Usoland... Usoland... {Just leave this line up until they finish.}

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,320
Uso...

232
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,950
Usoland!

233
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,060
Usoland?

234
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,300
Dammit, don't call my name!

235
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,600
Usoland? Hey, who's that?

236
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,810
Like I said, it's the name the dwarves said earlier.

237
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,740
You're an idiot. Just die.

238
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,040
As if I'd die, you damn brat.

239
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,550
Usoland is our hero.

240
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,390
H-H-Hero?

241
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,890
Then he's gonna come save you all?

242
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,880
That's right.

243
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,100
And not just us.

244
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,070
Usoland said he'd save us all.

245
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,780
The toys who are forced to work everyday down here.

246
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,280
Is he talking about us?

247
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Our comrades who are slaving away in the factory.

248
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:13,790
The toys who look cheerful walking through town as they cry inside.

249
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,100
The poor big folk who don't realize they've lost someone dear to them.

250
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,970
Usoland's gonna save us all.

251
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,310
He's a legendary hero!

252
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,950
Like hell I'm gonna pretend to be a hero!

253
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,650
Poor you.

254
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,820
He was lying all along.

255
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,490
Were you guys deceived again?

256
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,190
Are you telling the truth?

257
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:53,100
You're all about to die, and he still hasn't shown up. That's all the proof you need.

258
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,700
Where's the hero?

259
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,600
Well? Where?

260
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,210
But he said he'd save us.

261
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,910
He's probably somewhere laughing at how stupid you all are.

262
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,780
You guys are way too trusting.

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,850
And if this isn't some dream you made up,

264
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,720
and he really did say he'd save everyone, then he's the kind of guy who
 runs away in the face of danger.

265
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,730
Just throw away all hope!

266
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,530
I hate to say it, but he's mostly right.

267
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,200
You guys run away too. Good luck.

268
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Th-That can't be...

269
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,240
Shut up!

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,450
Usoland would never tell a lie!

271
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,490
Usoland is...

272
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,240
I'm Noland's descendant! {Xemnas: I searched through the scipts and script search and couldn't find this line, so I'm gonna assume it's a new flashback.}

273
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,870
Amazing!

274
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,540
No matter what, Usoland will definitely save us.

275
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,240
That's what he told us!

276
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,250
That's right.

277
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,480
That's right.

278
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,710
That's right.

279
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,920
That's right.

280
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,820
That's right.

281
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,720
That's right! That's right! That's right!

282
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,830
He promised us.

283
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,400
A hero would never deceive us!

284
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,170
If you keep besmirching Usoland's name,
you'll regret it.

285
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,580
You should prepare yourselves.

286
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,950
When Usoland comes, you won't-

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,920
What a funny scream.

288
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,590
The Tontattans have such a funny death cry.

289
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,230
Leo!

290
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,560
That's right. It's as Leo says.

291
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,000
Usoland will complete Operation SOP!

292
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,940
That's right.

293
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,580
You should feel sorry for yourselves, not us!

294
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,480
Then hurry up and call him, your hero.

295
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,690
How cruel is he?!

296
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,760
Stop it, just stop!

297
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,030
Just give it a rest already!

298
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Usoland!

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,410
Usoland!

300
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,970
Usopp!

301
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm so glad.

302
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,480
Just how long are you gonna believe in me, you idiotic dwarves?!

303
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,390
It's just as he said, it was all a lie.

304
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm not a legendary hero, and Usoland isn't my name.

305
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,370
I'm the sniper from the Straw Hat Pirates!

306
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,470
My name is Usopp!

307
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,170
I'm a pirate!

308
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,520
Th-The Straw Hat Pirates?

309
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
Why are they down here?

310
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,020
Why...

311
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,330
Why would you say that?

312
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,200
You may be a pirate, but you're still a hero, right?

313
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,370
I told you, no!

314
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,340
A pirate is a pirate!

315
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,440
Don't make me keep repeating myself!

316
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,650
I was lying to you all!

317
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,120
And you just kept believing me!

318
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,830
So you came all the way here just to say it was a lie?

319
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,470
If I didn't, these guys would keep waiting until they died.

320
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,910
If that happened, I could never live with myself.

321
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,080
Since they insist on believing in me so much,

322
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,620
I'll have to do the cool thing and risk my life to save them!

323
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,240
My name is Usopp!

324
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,890
Remember it well, Tontattans!

325
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:54,100
If I die, then build me a statue beside Noland's!

326
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm about to become your legendary hero!

327
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,080
Usopp!

328
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,310
Usopp, from the Straw Hat Pirates.

329
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,320
Is he gonna be the one to save us?

330
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,490
How desperate.

331
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,220
It's all or nothing!

332
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,160
Sure-Kill Green Star: Platanus...

333
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,230
...Shuriken!

334
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,810
How's that, you monster?!

335
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm the legendary hero, the Straw Hat Pirates' sniper, Captain Usopp!

336
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,720
Usoland!

337
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,290
It's Usopp!

338
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,260
Usoland!

339
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,630
I said it's Usopp!

340
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,100
The legendary hero, Usoland!

341
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,540
{\an8}It's been reported that you were on the first floor, young master.

342
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,010
Royal Palace, Second Floor
The Suit Chamber

343
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,850
What's that supposed to mean?

344
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,480
King Riku...

345
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,420
This is a fine sword.

346
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,820
If I become human again, I'll use this.

347
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,730
My father fought in the Colosseum today.

348
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,730
What? Really?

349
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,800
When he learned that the news of 
Doflamingo's abdication was incorrect,

350
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,470
he couldn't take it anymore, just like the rest of us.

351
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,440
King Riku was at the Colosseum?!

352
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,680
A young boy has committed murder!

353
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,920
Two people were killed in a scuffle in the slums!

354
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,470
Boy from the slums
Kyros (15 years old)

355
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,940
Your Majesty!

356
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,470
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

357
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,470
It's too dangerous!

358
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,110
He may be a child, but his bad reputation has spread throughout the country!

359
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,680
His Majesty is in danger! Shoot the boy!

360
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,650
No, don't shoot!

361
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,750
Lower your weapons!

362
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,220
B-But, Sir...

363
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,180
I understand you fought alone against dozens of opponents.

364
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,270
Over half of them were injured, and two of them...

365
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,770
They killed my best friend.

366
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,140
I was just paying them back!

367
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Are you a beast?

368
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,020
Call me whatever you like!
You royals don't understand anything!

369
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,550
He was the only one in this world I could trust!

370
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,990
He was like a brother to me.

371
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,930
Your name is Kyros, right?

372
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,600
Come with me.

373
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,500
A fifteen-year-old killer, Kyros!

374
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:25,310
Corrida Colosseum

375
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,720
His opponent is a veteran gladiator!

376
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,330
This is a sacred Colosseum!

377
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,390
What talent! If that blade had been sharp, his opponent would've died instantly!

378
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,190
Outside they call it "brutality", but in here it's "talent", huh?

379
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,300
He effortlessly beat his cell mates half to death.

380
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,100
He's gone six days without eating,
continuously shouting for us to call you.

381
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,600
What do you want with me, King Riku?!

382
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,040
King Riku is saying that if you can win a hundred battles,

383
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,540
he will grant you a parole.
It doesn't matter how many years it takes.

384
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,880
Four months later

385
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,590
At last, Kyros stands at a hundred battles and a hundred victories!

386
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,230
He's put even our biggest stars to shame!

387
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,300
Don't go back out, murderer!

388
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,170
You won't leave?

389
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,000
I won't go where I'm not wanted.

390
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,840
When did you start caring about being wanted?

391
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,110
Shut it!

392
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,150
Beasts...

393
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,020
can only be appreciated...

394
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,390
inside their cages!

395
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,290
Two hundred victories!

396
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,320
Somebody, defeat Kyros!

397
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,030
Take him down!

398
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,300
Three hundred victories!

399
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,310
None can stop Kyros!
The heroes keep falling before him!

400
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,660
At last... At last...

401
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,380
The fourth year 
in the Colosseum

402
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,410
he is the first man to ever...

403
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,820
win a thousand battles straight!{ The last guy won a 1000 battles gay. }

404
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,420
Kyros-sama!

405
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,320
You go, Kyros!

406
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,330
You've come here again?

407
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,500
Stay back!

408
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,040
How could you understand?

409
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,910
No matter what I do,
I'll always be a murderer and a beast!

410
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,930
Is there...

411
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,280
no way...

412
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,390
they could forget me?
