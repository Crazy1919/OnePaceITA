The bonds that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,180
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,070

Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,670
Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,350
and head for your goal, that's what adventure is all about!

Hey, what's with that shrimp?!

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,540
Spartan got beat!

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,310
No way!

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,450
He's one of the star gladiators of this Colosseum!

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,620
Maybe, he just tripped over himself.

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,790
That wouldn't lodge someone in the ground!

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,860
Now, where should I sit?

51
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,780
Did you just start that fight?!

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,030
That isn't allowed! You're disqualified!

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,200
What?!

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,770
We don't need hooligans like you
causing scuffles before a match...

{\an8}He's unconscious though.

Oh! It's Sai and Boo from Flower Country!

64
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,900
Even Don Chinjao is here!

65
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,590
He's a legend!

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,050
You saved me! Thank you!

67
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,680
Nah, don't mention it.

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,860
Honestly, you don't have to mention it...

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,340
You don't have to say "Thank you"...

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,900
Don't say the words "Thank you."

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,520
Take back your "Thank you," you bastard!

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,780
You don't have to refuse
his thanks that much, brother!

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,560
Don't ever say those words to me, idiot!

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,930
Sorry. He's really excitable.

75
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,580
There are all kinds of people in the world.

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,460
You... Stop ganging up with other powerhouses from your block, Dagama!

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey hey, look at them.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,330
Yeah, there are a whole bunch of big names from each and every country!

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,300
Assassins from a neighboring country
Funk Brothers

80
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,300
{\an8}It's an international war for the devil fruit!

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,200
{\an8}Ganging up and paying people off?

82
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,010
Older Brother
 Kelly Funk

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,010
{\an8}You make me sick!

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,660
{\an8}It's a one-on-one fight.

85
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:28,040
Younger Brother
Bobby Funk

86
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,980
{\an8}Even if you cheat like that, only one contestant per block can go to the next round.

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,580
{\an8}Cut the crap!

88
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,100
Prodense Kingdom - Military Tactician
Dagama

89
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,850
{\an8}I know you two are here on your country's orders, too!

90
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,290
{\an8}Any country that has the Flame Fruit,

91
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,680
{\an8}which is more powerful than any weapon,

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,300
King of the Prodense Kingdom Â· The Fighting King
Elizabello II

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,300
{\an8}would give any country an advantage in diplomatic relations.

94
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,150
Look around you. See those faces?

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,590
There! He is a Class-A war criminal who was involved in the Sea Battle of Dias - Suleiman the Beheader!

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,880
They're the former bounty hunters who bombed a government institution - Abdullah and Jeet.

97
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,780
A fake adventurer - "The Surmounter" Orlumbus.

98
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,900
Sponsored by the Donquixote Family...

99
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,990
a sadistic pirate who's worth over 100 million - Bellamy the Hyena.

100
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,400
And the "Pirate Noble" Cavendish is here...

101
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,210
...as well as the crazy rookie Bartolomeo who became infamous a year ago.

102
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,570
Now, do you really think that none of these ill-famed people are plotting anything?!

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,030
It's crazy to think they don't have a plan!

104
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm sure you guys have something! Don't you?

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,620
The first round is a battle royale!

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,420
Only one winner per block 
will go to the next round.

107
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,860
Yeah!

108
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,840
Block A's match will start soon!

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,030
Followed by blocks B, C, and D.

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,880
There are over 550 competitors here.

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,740
And only four of us will win the first round!

112
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,870
It won't be so easy.

113
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,470
So I guess...

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,380
...you brothers are in the same block because of paying somebody off, am I right?

115
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,910
It's just a coincidence.

116
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,120
It's a coincidence.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,340
Which block am I in?

118
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,870
I'm sure the receptionist told you already.

119
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,760
Your number is 556 so you're in Block C.

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,720
I know everybody has different goals...

121
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,200
but the world could fall into chaos depending on who gets the Flame Fruit.

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Let's cut the crap and 
do our best, everybody!

123
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,390
Armor! Helmets!

124
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,160
{\an8}This is awesome! Can we use anything here?!

125
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,160
The Colosseum Armory

126
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,790
You can use anything
except projectile weapons.

127
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,280
A half-naked statue of an old warrior man!

128
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,730
Cool!

129
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,070
I want it!

130
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,020
I will wear this armor!

131
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,610
And a helmet that's cooler 
than that old man's!

132
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,140
So cool!

133
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,930
I want to show this to Usopp and the others!

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,250
Hey, what's wrong?!

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,360
Th-The nobleman is so...

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Nobleman?!

137
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,320
All of the women are fainting.

138
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,760
What?!

139
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,640
No, its too much!

140
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,700
Look, that's Cavendish!

141
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,530
The Pirate Noble?! He's alive?!

142
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,480
I can't believe how beautiful he is!

143
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,910
This is the dressing room, huh?

144
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,320
Hey you, right there.

145
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,220
That won't do.

146
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,410
{\an8}There is a weight limit for gear.

147
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,410
Gladiator
Lucy

148
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,990
Well, whatever you do,
you have no chance.

149
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,480
I will win the Flame Fruit.

150
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,870
Captain of the Beautiful Pirates
"White Horse Cavendish"
 Bounty: 280,000,000 Belly

151
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,590
Yes! With that beautiful power that belongs only to me.

152
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
You're overweight.

153
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,470
What?!

154
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,050
I told you earlier! Come here!

155
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,250
Tsk! But I look so cool in this!

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,990
That explains why everybody's half-naked.

157
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,120
Gladiators are just part of a show for them.

158
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,990
People get excited seeing a loser's blood.

159
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,620
At the Colosseum, people 
 show their true colors.

160
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,150
How is watching a match between two heavily-armored competitors any fun?

161
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,240
For them, this battle is just a show.

162
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,280
I wonder if I have to take off this cape too?

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
It looks so cool!

164
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,980
Hey you.

165
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,360
I watched you take down that big guy earlier.

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,690
Who are you?

167
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,860
I'm Luffy!

168
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,740
What?!

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,160
Lu...

170
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm gonna become the Pirate King!

171
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,950
Lu...

172
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,740
You mean Lucy!

173
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,300
Oh yeah, I'm Lucy.

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,870
Don't confuse us!

175
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,200
Oh, you're Lucy!

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,820
I thought Straw Hat Luffy was here!

177
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,140
There's no way!

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,280
I heard the real one is 
a eight-meter-tall giant!

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,780
This is nice!

180
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,060
If you were really...

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,360
Straw Hat Luffy, I would have...

182
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,830
killed you here and now.

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,830
What?

184
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,800
I came to the New World three years ago.

185
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,890
The whole world was talking about this beautiful rookie who was worth over 200 million.

186
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,380
I was in the newspapers everyday.

187
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,860
Girls went nuts over my wanted posters.

188
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,460
They would steal all of the posters in town.

189
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,780
Everybody was going crazy over me.

190
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,270
"Hey, big star!"

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,740
"Who? Me?"

192
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,730
"Of course!"

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,430
But...

194
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,550
...one year later,

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,750
Whitebeard's War drew their attention away from me!

196
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,600
The whole world's attention was on Straw Hat Luffy and Whitebeard!

197
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,490
On top of that,

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,580
new rookies kept coming up one after another, became known as the Worst Generation,

199
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,360
and wreaked havoc like crazy!

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,990
Reporters won't pay attention to me anymore!

201
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,860
That's why I'm gonna kill them!
 Every one of those annoying newcomers!

202
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,390
All of them!

203
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,900
What you're saying is absurd.

204
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,400
Say whatever you like!

205
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,660
To recapture world attention again,

206
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,420
I would kill as many newcomers as it takes!

207
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,030
To do so, I'm gonna win the Flame Fruit today!

208
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,930
Your good to go.

209
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,680
You're taking the same attitude as them!

210
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,900
Are you a competitor?

211
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,220
You look weak but you're a cutie!

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Hm... Interesting.

213
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,000
I ended up looking like this old man.

214
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,580
Are you interested in him?

215
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,970
Who are you?

216
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,780
{\an8}Rebecca. I'm a gladiator.

217
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,980
Corrida Colosseum Gladiator
Rebecca

218
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,540
{\an8}Thank you for what you did earlier.

219
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,980
{\an8}I didn't like Spartan.

220
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,480
This statue is cast after a legendary man.

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,850
He was the strongest gladiator in the history of Corrida Colosseum, Kyros.

222
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,220
He won 3000 out of 3000 matches.

223
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,620
The only wound he ever 
received was a single slash.

224
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,300
Wow! He was that strong?!

225
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,960
He used to fight here up until 20 years ago.

226
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,770
But no one in this country knows about him.

227
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,560
Huh?

228
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,340
None of elders or gladiators in this country
have ever seen him.

229
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,780
It's the most mysterious statue in Dressrosa.

230
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,460
We don't know if Kyros the Gladiator actually existed...

231
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,260
or if somebody made up the story and put a statue here.

232
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,870
All we know is
what's written on this plaque.

233
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,170
Although nobody knows about him,

234
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,670
nobody wants to remove it.

235
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,770
That's also strange.

236
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,820
Hm... I don't get it at all but...

237
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,580
I like this statue! It's so manly!

238
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
I like it, too.

239
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,750
Hey, Great Warrior Rebecca-chan!

240
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,720
The undefeated girl!
We know you'll do it today, too!

241
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm sure you were relieved earlier...

242
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,560
That Spartan guy who bullied you for 
a long time got his ass kicked.

243
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,970
Stop it, idiot! Let's go!

244
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,320
What's with them?

245
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,340
Ignore them.

246
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,010
I...

247
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,660
I'm gonna fight for the last time today.

248
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,850
I'm gonna win the Flame Fruit and...

249
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm gonna kill Doflamingo!

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,220
What?! Mingo?!

251
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,310
What block are you in?

252
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,160
C.

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,430
Good. I'm in D.

254
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,600
I hope we both survive the first round.

255
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,490
Lucy.

256
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,690
The winner of Block A is the masked man!

257
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,590
Mr. Store!

258
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,460
That was so fast!

259
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,630
Oh? Is he going to take his mask off?! For real?!

260
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,300
He took it off!

261
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,570
What?!

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,610
I can't believe this! We all know him!

263
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,680
What an interesting start!
And an unexpected competitor!

264
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,700
The winner of the Block A battle royale is...

265
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,620
Oh, he's...

266
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,440
the captain of the first ship of
the fearful Emperor Blackbeard's pirate crew.

267
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,060
it's Jesus Burgess!

268
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,550
He's...

269
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,140
That champion from way back then!

270
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,380
Burgess! Burgess! Burgess! Burgess!

271
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,700
{\an8}Burgess! Burgess! Burgess! Burgess!

272
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,780
Scene 1
"Corrida Colosseum"

273
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,780
{\an8}The Blackbeard Pirates, huh?

274
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,320
I was expecting
Luffy to win this thing pretty easily but...

275
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,760
it looks like it might be a bit harder to do.

276
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,390
I hope no one finds out who he is.

277
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,760
Now, I've got work to do.

278
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,230
Hey! Wait a minute!

279
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,700
I'll come with you!

280
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,700
What?! You're in the way!

281
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,970
I don't need a guy who doesn't 
know where the factory is!

282
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,540
I'm gonna beat the hell out of some high-ranking guy in the Doflamingo Family...

283
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,580
Whoa-whoa! Wait! Be quiet!

284
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,580
and make him cough up where it is.

285
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,540
What is it now?!

286
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,960
Let's go someplace else to talk!

287
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,350
Such radical speech here is taboo!

288
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,590
Who the hell are you?

289
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,120
Same location
"Audience Seating"

290
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,120
{\an8}"Pirate Mercenary" Hajrudin...

291
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,540
Cavendish!?

292
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,520
Even "The Missionary" Gambia?!

293
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
Let's go!

294
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,830
Hey hey, you don't have to rush like that.

295
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,530
Yeah, there are a bunch of bad guys.

296
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,580
I was surprised about Burgess, too.

297
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,400
I'll talk to Issho-san right away.

298
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay.

299
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,670
Hey hey!

300
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,280
Sonny, are you talking to yourself?!

301
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,700
{\an8}Or were you talking with someone on the outside?

302
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,570
Staff officer of the "Barto Club" pirate crew
Bounty: 67,000,000 Belly

303
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,390
{\an8}You're strange!

304
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,720
"The Missionary" Gambia

305
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,700
Am I right? Am I right?

306
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,600
What's that note?!

307
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,630
You were whispering those cool guys' names!

308
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,970
Don't tell me...

309
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,040
are you a...

310
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,500
Are you all right, sir? Please respond.

311
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,140
Everything's fine.

312
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,680
I'll call you back in ten minutes.

313
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,960
The Colosseum is still excited
from the battle of Block A!

314
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,080
I wonder how it's going to go for Block B!

315
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,590
Shall we go out?

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,460
There are so many familiar
names, aren't there?

317
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,100
So what should we do now?

318
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,530
Oh, your coat.

319
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,900
We need, maybe, three warships.

320
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,660
{\an8}And in the meantime, let's head for... uh...

321
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,870
Navy Headquarters Admiral

322
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,620
{\an8}What was the name?

323
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,120
{\an8}It's Green Bit.

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,490
Fujitora
(Issho)

325
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,260
{\an8}Yes, let's go there.

326
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,490
{\an8}And um...

327
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,260
We'll need as many medics as we can get.

328
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,830
We can't have any casualties.

329
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,460
I also want to know how many spectators
there are in the Colosseum...

330
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,020
and the population of this town.

331
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,460
Okay... Instead of the enemy numbers?

332
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,130
Is it necessary?

333
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,850
What we have to consider first is
not the number of enemies...

334
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,320
...but the number of people we have to protect, don't you think?

335
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,860
Yes, sir!

336
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,820
This is Maynard.

337
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,940
Excuse me for hanging up earlier.

338
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,370
Everything is okay here.

339
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,070
Toilets / Garbage dump

340
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,070
{\an8}Oh, and earlier, I mentioned a name; "The Missionary" Gambia...

341
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,500
{\an8}who works under Bartolomeo.

342
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,380
Fighter 0429
Capman

343
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,380
{\an8}You can cross that out.

344
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,650
It wasn't him that I saw after all.

345
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,840
D-Damn! That Marine.

346
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,490
Navy Headquarters Vice Admiral
Maynard the Pursuer

347
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,490
{\an8}I'll continue with the plan we have for here, also.

348
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,920
At a cafÃ© in the northeast

349
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,520
Scene 2
Caesar exchange team

350
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,510
{\an8}Green Bit?

351
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,410
It wouldn't be wise to go there.

352
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,310
Are you people some kind of researchers or explorers?

353
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,200
You better not go unless you have a purpose that's worth risking your life for.

354
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,360
That bridge looks very strong...

355
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,960
Yes, it's made of iron.

356
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,100
But look at the entrance.
Nobody is crossing it nowadays.

357
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,040
A school of Fighting Fish inhabit the area around Green Bit.

358
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,860
Before they came, people used to come and go freely,

359
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,350
but that was 200 years ago.

360
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,480
Mister, what's a Fighting Fish?

361
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
It's a savage fish with horns.

362
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,520
If you approach them by ship, they'll capsize you.

363
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,430
That's why they reinforced the bridge with iron, but it doesn't help.

364
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,800
No use?! What do you mean?!

365
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,970
Are you saying they can take down an iron bridge?!

366
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, I don't know the current condition of the bridge.

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,500
Only people who crossed it know, but I don't know anyone who's came back.

368
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,340
What?!

369
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, Tra-guy!

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
You have to change the hand-over spot now!

371
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,260
He's right!

372
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,200
Think what it's like to be handed over at such a place, fool!

373
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
You fool!

374
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,700
We'll stick with the plan.

375
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,280
We're already here, so stop making a fuss.

376
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,740
More importantly,

377
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,330
I'm worried about the situation of this country.

378
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,660
Their king suddenly abdicated.

379
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,540
How come they are so calm?

380
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,220
There's something strange going on here.

381
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,770
That's what worries me!

382
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,920
W-What are you doing, Robi-

383
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,020
What's going on?

384
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,920
CP-0.

385
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,450
What?! "CP"?

386
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,040
{\an8}The strongest intelligence organization in the world.

387
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,230
{\an8}Cipher Pol Aigis 0!

388
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,370
D-Don't tell me they're related to CP-9!

389
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,940
They're the strongest of all of those organizations!

390
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,440
When they're on the move, bad things follow.

391
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,100
Indeed.

392
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,470
Scene 3
The fairy and Zoro

393
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
Gotcha!

394
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,340
I'll be taking my sword!

395
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,910
Oh no!

396
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,220
Ow, ow, ow... This is no good!

397
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm so dumb! This human will see me!

398
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,700
I have to run! Otherwise, the human will...

399
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,040
Scene 4
Kin'emon, alone and astray

400
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,000
Who are you people?

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,130
I'm just an old man out for a walk!

402
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,160
Don't lie! Isn't that a topknot under your hat?

403
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,610
You're the samurai, Foxfire Kin'emon, aren't you?!

404
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,440
We saw you in the video from Punk Hazard.

405
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,990
And we figured you would come back here,

406
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,960
samurai.

407
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,130
Am I right?

408
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,460
Now now, just come along quietly!

409
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,300
If you care about the life of that Kanjuro you're after!

410
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,470
Scene 5
Sanji, in love

411
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,510
Target confirmed.

412
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,780
Violet-chan!

413
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,000
Dear Nami-san and Robin-chan.

414
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,970
How is the weather there?

415
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,010
I can't believe it! You're so strong!

416
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,700
It was nothing! Anybody can detect a sniper sitting 16 meters above the ground!

417
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,710
It was nothing!

418
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,400
How reliable!

419
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,220
I'm in the middle of a hurricane called love!

420
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm...

421
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,160
...in love!

422
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,930
I'm here for you!

423
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,320
Scene 6
Sunny safety and security team

424
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,870
{\an8}All wrong! You shouldn't drink it all up!

425
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,480
Listen! The taster's role is to try just a little of the shogun's food to check for poison!

426
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,500
Understood?!

427
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,820
Yes, sir!

428
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,600
Try again!

429
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,750
Get me a cup of tea, Choppa'emon.

430
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,300
{\an8}Yes, sir!

431
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,920
{\an8}I'll bring it to you right away, sir!

432
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,920
Retainer: Choppa'emon

433
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,800
Maid: O-Nami

434
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,340
How are you feeling now, sir?

435
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,600
Ah, this is so comfortable.

436
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm feeling great.

437
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,060
Yeah? That's good.

438
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,020
I'm feeling great, too!

439
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,300
Th-That hurt, Nami-san!

440
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,900
I thought it was a sleeping-in-your-lap party!

441
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,460
What kind of party is that?!

442
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,700
He's playing shogun.

443
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,760
Playing shogun?

444
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,300
Whenever we leave Momo alone, he gets very serious and depressed.

445
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,380
He's not gonna share it with us, but...

446
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,240
maybe he has had some kind of trauma at a young age.

447
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,280
What?!

448
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,010
I see. It was something like that.

449
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,940
Hey, Bone-kichi!

450
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,320
Yes?

451
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,250
Do something to warm the place up.

452
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,520
No. Luffy-san is the only one I take orders fro-

453
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,470
Just do it!

454
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:24,030
Don't like it I don't like it!

455
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,310
Doesn't matter how many times we bury him...

456
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,440
He's gonna come back!

457
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,580
Yeah!

458
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,550
The Vitality Corpse!

459
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,500
Come on!

460
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,240
Thank you, everybody!

461
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,460
Huh?

462
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I don't like it...

463
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,820
What?!

464
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,940
I thought it was just the four of us on the ship.

465
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,760
So did I... I wonder what's making that noise.

466
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,710
Creepy!

467
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,180
I'm scared!

468
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,450
O-Nami!

469
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't like it... Honestly...

470
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,320
I-I-It's from the men's dormitory.

471
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,360
Oh, I don't like it!

472
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,960
There is somebody in there!

473
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,300
Who is it?

474
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,430
Corrida Colosseum

475
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,200
Competitors of Block B! Is Capman here?!

476
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,190
And Bartolomeo?!

477
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,820
You're Bartolomeo, aren't you?

478
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,580
Block B's match will start soon!

479
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,240
And did you see a competitor named Capman?

480
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,480
Well...
