The bond that joins us will never break

and its light will shine on the end of our dreams.

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,270
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,180
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll find One Piece...

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,100
and become the Pirate King!

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,430
Every trial we overcome brings a chance for thrills. (I can't stay)

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,670
Tomorrow and each day after will be heated, intense.

Trust your curiosity, follow your heart

That's right.

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,920
There is an underground passage between Green Bit and Dressrosa.

Oh, Usoland, watch your step!

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Sorry!

We're going to fly at high speed!

69
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,640
I'll be counting on you two!

70
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,730
Leave it to us!

71
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,900
Our squad members have been training so hard for this day!

72
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,690
I've never seen this kind.

73
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,110
I want to show it to Luffy!

74
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,400
Usoland! Robiland!

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,250
You two are big so take the 20 passenger bus.

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,150
Come on, Linear Foxes!

77
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,610
20-Passenger Bus: Linear Fox
(Yelp Express)

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,460
This is nice! It's like a couch for a king!

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,900
They're fast when they run.

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,670
What gorgeous hair!

81
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,090
Alright, everybody! Let's get going!

82
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,250
With our hero Usoland!

83
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,520
To take back the 500 friends who are held captive!

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah!

85
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,740
I think I have to tell you two...

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,280
why we want to do this.

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,470
Where're you coming out from, old man?!

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,620
Gancho-san!

89
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,700
I'm the Tonta-chief, Gancho!

90
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,640
Thank you for this trip!

91
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,410
Alright!

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
Since you're going to fight and risk your lives,

93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,220
you should know about this.

94
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,320
Well, I'm not willing to go that far...

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,430
Donquixote Doflamingo has been causing us, the Tontatta Tribe, a lot of pain recently.

96
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,300
But our connection with him goes way back
before the events of the last decade, actually.

97
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,620
It goes back about 900 years.

98
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,410
What?!

99
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,680
Here in Dressrosa, there is a vast sunflower field.

100
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,440
Somewhere in that field of blooming sunflowers, at a place no one knows,

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,430
there is a secret entrance.

102
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,400
Descend the stairs there,

103
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,050
and you will hear courageous voices.

104
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,170
Let me introduce you!

105
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,210
Commander!

106
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,680
We've been waiting for you, Commander!

107
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,730
Thanks, everyone!

108
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,350
Anti-Doflamingo Organization
"Riku Royal Army" Rebellion HQ

109
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,260
He looks like a strong toy-man!

110
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,460
What kind of Big Human was he?!

111
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,200
It's good to have him on the day of the battle!

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,230
We're going to fight with them!

113
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,630
They're Dwarves from the Tontatta Kingdom!

114
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,940
Dwarves?

115
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,500
They're as strong as you are.

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,460
They move faster than people can see them.

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,770
So they call them "fairies" in the town.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,890
So the one who stole Zoro's sword was...

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,430
Quick!

120
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,170
Weren't you supposed to go back to your ship!?

121
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,380
Hey, don't let him attack you, Luffy!

122
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,160
Big Brother-san, I can't see!

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Zoro!

124
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,020
Damn, that bastard!

125
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,890
Why didn't he tell me something like this was happening?!

126
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,780
I want to fight with my swords!

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,930
Oh, Commander!

128
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,770
Oh, Franky!

129
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,300
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,610
Commander, we have sorted out the intelligence from the scouting unit!

131
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,030
We know what the enemies and Sugar are doing.

132
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,550
And, no big surprise, with the battle close at hand...

133
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,670
That's right!

134
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,460
Some legendary heroes have appeared at Tontatta!

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,860
Their names are Usoland and Robiland!

136
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,060
They say they're on their way here!

137
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,870
On top of that, they have some friends with them.

138
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,130
Their names are:

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,830
Luffyland, Zoroland, Namiland, Sanland...

140
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,220
Chopperland, Fraland, and Boneland!

141
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,810
Must be Usopp!

142
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,140
Why did he tell such a lie?

143
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,050
Um, looks like I'm Zoroland.

144
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,830
I'm Fraland! Nice to meet you!

145
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,050
What?! That's awesome!

146
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,620
Oh, I don't have time for this!

147
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,670
I gotta get back to the Sunny!
Nami and the others are in danger!

148
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,060
What do you think I've been telling you?!

149
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
Coastal waters off Dressrosa

150
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,760
{\an8}It's no use!

151
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,700
Art is unstoppable!

152
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,840
Blow Kung-Fu...

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,430
Art!

154
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,440
This is just smoke!

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,330
Here I go! Weather Egg!

156
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,860
Come on out, Snow Clouds!

157
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,680
Ew! Disgusting!

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,740
You turned my Clima Tact into a toy!

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,240
What an insult!

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,370
Who did you call a super model?!

161
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,250
I didn't say that!

162
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,880
"Turned it into a toy"? Don't confuse it with a toy!

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,100
You have no taste!

164
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,590
A devil fruit user that turns people into toys is within our family, but...

165
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,230
I'm an art-human who ate the Art Fruit!

166
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,980
You people have been turned into art!

167
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,850
Damn! Nami got defeated, too!

168
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,900
My antlers and hooves are useless!

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,260
Hey, Bone-kichi, she's trying to kidnap me!

170
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,340
I know! I'm not going to let her do it!

171
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,770
But look at this.

172
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,970
My Soul Solid looks like this!

173
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,120
Why are you whining like you're a victim?!

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,280
You should be happy that I made you artistic!

175
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,260
More importantly, look what you did to my submarine!

176
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,390
And to my men!

177
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,090
To avenge them,

178
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,850
what kind of artistic death should I bring to you?!

179
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,700
Hello? It's me! Who is this?!

180
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,910
We're in big trouble right now! Help us!

181
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,000
Who said you could pick that up?!

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Is this Tony-ya?!

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,080
I don't care what's going on over there!
Listen carefully!

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
What?! Is this Tra-guy?!

185
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,380
Is that Law?

186
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,600
What are you doing, Tra-guy?! Come to the ship right now!

187
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,360
We got turned into art! Help us!

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,390
I-I'm just fine!

189
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,700
Listen, I need you to...

190
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,060
sail the ship to Green Bit now!

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,530
I want to leave Caesar with you guys!

192
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,620
Whaat?! He asked us the impossible and hung up!

193
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,130
I thought he already handed Caesar-san over!

194
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,350
What's wrong with him?!

195
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,480
He just talked without hearing what we had to say!

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
Is he Luffy?!

197
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,220
Green Bit

198
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,300
It's no use, Law!

199
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
Who did you call just now?

200
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,110
Give me back Caesar's heart already.

201
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,370
It's so meaningless for you to keep hanging on here.

202
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,420
Your partner, Straw Hat, has already walked into the trap that I set up.

203
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,500
He's now fighting in the gladiatorial contest at the Colosseum.

204
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,660
Tough contenders from all over the world
come to fight in that outlaws-only, deadly competition.

205
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,060
When someone loses, it's a one-way ticket to hell.

206
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,950
He'll never make it out of the Colosseum alive.

207
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,760
Your alliance is over.

208
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,490
Law...

209
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,070
give up!

210
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,580
Dressrosa
Sanji and Kin'emon

211
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,070
Go! Luffy-dono!

212
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,050
Why're you cheering with the others?!{How can he be talking here... lol. Fix needed}

213
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,010
But, Sanji-dono, when a man fights, he has to win!

214
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,890
Burgess!

215
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,060
I heard that it's getting interesting!

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,690
Who's the shrimp?

217
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,440
Rubber...

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,380
Hawk Rifle!

219
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,540
Lucy's going for it!

220
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
You're quite a fighter.

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,940
I can't get beaten by you here!

222
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,080
That's a joke! You have no chance!

223
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,440
They lionized you squirts by calling you all "The Worst Generation", and it looks like it emboldened you.

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,220
But you guys aren't strong enough to go across the sea that we fought on.

225
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,660
Without Whitebeard, we can't expect too much from the next generation.

226
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,000
The only guy who looks good is Blackbeard Teach!

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,300
Blackbeard?

228
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,830
If I had to pick one, it's him. But anyway,

229
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,530
if you're only good enough to compete against me in my present condition, your hopeless!

230
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,850
Just give up being a pirate!

231
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:03,160
You're not half bad, but if Rayleigh chose a brat
of this level as the flag-bearer for the new generation,

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,610
he's not as bright as he used to be!

233
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,590
The Marines showed some good insight when they squelched the most evil of the lot,

234
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,330
I mean Ace, of course, in the war two years ago.

235
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,420
That fool had the demon's blood in his veins!

236
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,730
You think you can beat the Marine admirals and the Four Emperors, and surpass Roger?!

237
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,360
That's absolutely impossible!

238
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,530
Rubber...

239
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,850
Rocket!

240
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,350
Lucy is flying?!

241
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,790
That's an incredibly high jump!

242
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,030
Come on! I'm going to teach you a lesson!

243
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:49,420
With 30 years worth of focused anger, I'm going all out, Straw Hat Luffy!

244
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,810
What the hell is with this ice?!

245
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,670
We can't break it with fire or an axe!

246
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,560
But under the ice you can see all this pirate treasure!

247
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,100
This continent is made of what they call "Crystal Ice Sheet", and to break it,

248
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,870
you have to put tremendous amount of pressure on one spot!

249
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,210
Drilling Dragon Auger Spike!

250
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,980
Open, Chinjao!

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,600
Did you fellows like that?

252
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,510
Hey, tie those treasure thieves up and dump them into the sea!

253
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,810
Okay, Boss!

254
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
True happiness!

255
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:16,820
Happo Pirate Navy's 12th Leader
Chinajo the Auger (30 Years Ago)

256
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,960
This room of ice contains everything of my life.

257
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,560
Joys and sorrows from the past.

258
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,390
Hopes for the future.

259
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,150
Several decades worth of my family's treasures!

260
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,150
My drill head is the only key to the room.

261
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,130
Nobody can invade this place! Not even the Marines!

262
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,200
Hey, Chinjao! I'm going to break that head of yours today.

263
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,850
As preparation, I put aside the punching bag and trained by reducing eight mountains to dust.

264
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,050
No matter what you do, it's no use!

265
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,710
There is not a thing in the world harder than my head!

266
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,330
Prepare yourself, Chinjao!

267
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,300
I'm going to break that fist you're so proud of, Garp!

268
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,110
Boss!

269
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,780
He did it!

270
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
Retreat!

271
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,000
All ships, set sail!

272
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,130
Boss!

273
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,080
Boss! I'm glad that you're okay!

274
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,950
Open Chinjao!

275
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,420
Drilling Dragon Auger Spike!

276
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,080
Boss!

277
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,820
Please stop, Boss!

278
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,000
You're going to die!

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,560
Open!

280
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,750
It won't open.

281
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,570
What should I do?! Those are my treasures!

282
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,940
I can see them right there! There's everything of my life!

283
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,650
My fortune!

284
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,210
Damn you, Garp! I'll never forgive you!

285
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,520
I will carry this grudge towards your children and your children's children, Garp!

286
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,490
I am...

287
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,340
cursing you and will hold it forever!

288
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,250
A short time later, I retired from pirating.

289
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,660
I lost my power and my heart was broken.

290
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,310
What's that?!

291
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,180
Am I hallucinating!? It seems like...

292
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,310
Lucy's arm has become gigantic!

293
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,450
Watch what I'm going to do, Garp!

294
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,590
I'm going to kill your precious grandson!

295
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,170
Pay for it!

296
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,860
Your old man's punch took everything away from me!

297
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,740
Stop whining over one punch!

298
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,600
I can't count how many times he punched me!

299
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm going to smash all of your bones to pieces!

300
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,250
Eight Impact Fist Secret Technique...

301
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,180
Rubber...

302
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,060
Thor...

303
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,720
Drill-less Dragon's...

304
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,930
Elephant Gun!

305
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,500
Drill-less Bit!

306
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,770
Whaat?!

307
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,880
Whaat?!

308
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,100
Old man!

309
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,050
Grandpa!

310
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,790
Oh, ring out!

311
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,660
Chinjao was eliminated by being thrown out of the ring!

312
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,740
What a man!

313
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,080
The one who beat a legend and won the fierce fight of Block C is...

314
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,980
Lucy the Gladiator!

315
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,600
Yeah!

316
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,680
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

317
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,760
I didn't expect him to go this far, that Lucy!

318
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,960
It's really a surprising ending!

319
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,450
Cut the "Lucy" crap!

320
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,180
Those cheers are irritating!

321
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,930
He's that popular even while using a fake name!

322
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,430
Just come back here already!

323
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm not going to let you get away this time, Straw Hat!

324
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,410
Didn't you hear what I said before?

325
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,030
I'm not going to let you kill him.

326
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,630
Cavendish!

327
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,320
If you get in my way, I'm going to kill you, too, Bartolomeo!

328
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,890
Fine by me!

329
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm going to kill Straw Hat!

330
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,720
Straw Hat?

331
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,100
How interesting!

332
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,130
So that's how it is!
