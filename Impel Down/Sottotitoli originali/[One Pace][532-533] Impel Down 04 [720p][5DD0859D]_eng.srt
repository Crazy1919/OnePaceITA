00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,410
The prisoners we suspect are aiding Straw Hat Luffy are as follows...

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,040
Prisoner number E 8200,

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,010
the pirate, Buggy the Clown...

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,610
Prisoner number D 0464,

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,480
former Baroque Works agent,

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,800
Galdino, alias Mr. 3.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,990
Prisoner number C 9915,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,470
another former agent of Baroque Works,

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,770
Bentham, alias Mr. 2 Bon Kurei.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,340
Right now, Straw Hat Luffy and Mr. 2 Bon Kurei are causing an uproar in the N-sector of Level 3.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,530
The Blugori can't restrain them!

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,630
It seems the two of them are headed for the stairs to Level 4.

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,610
However, we've yet to locate the pirate, Buggy the Clown and Galdino, Mr. 3.

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,760
A riot in Level 2,

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,920
and intruders running wild throughout the prison...

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,800
Things've gotten pretty interesting around here.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,270
Great way to kill some time.

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,230
It'll all be over for'em anyway, once they get caught.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,050
What happened to Saldeath?

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,520
The Blugori couldn't stop Straw Hat Luffy and Mr. 2, so...

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,940
...he's gone to suppress the uproar in Level 2.

25
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,770
Why did nobody report the situation to me before it got this bad?!

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,880
You were so focused on Hancock-dono that you ignored the reports, remember?

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
I ignored the reports, you say?!

28
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,030
Did the guests leave, Warden?

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,740
Oh, Sadi-chan.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,490
Salute the Jailer!

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,010
We've finished preparing for the hunt...

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,080
So, what should we do?

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,570
Perfect timing. Is anyone on Level 3?

34
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,620
The Minotaurus...

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,230
went there.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,880
I see. But there's a way out of Level 3.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,390
I suppose he won't be able to pursue them.

38
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,390
I'll leave the fracas on Level 2 to Saldeath...

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,770
Send all remaining Impel Down staff here to Level 4!

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,270
Understood, Sir!

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,600
If they manage to escape from the Minotaurus and fall down here...

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,370
I'll finish them off personally in Inferno Hell!

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,750
They've underestimated this Great Prison, Impel Down!

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,900
W-What's with this thing? It sure is fast!

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,050
It's the Minotaurus!

46
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,870
The Minotaurus?

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,900
A cold-blooded Demon Guard!

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,060
A monster that tosses people like trash!

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,070
That's what it is!

50
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,090
Jailer Beast

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,090
Minotaurus

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,090
{\an8}A monster? A Devil Fruit user?

53
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,830
Bon-chan!

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,000
That hurt!

55
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,540
That thing's fast!

56
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,540
Straw-chan, watch out!

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,320
Tamer's Whip!

58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,090
I'm... dying...

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,280
Gear Second...

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,320
Rubber...

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,440
Jet...

62
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,960
Bazooka!

63
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,360
You alright, Bon-chan?

64
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,580
I-I thought I was dying...

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,840
I saw a field of Okama before my eyes...

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,790
You really are strong...

67
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm sure that monster is still alive, but he must be hurt.

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,400
Huh? What?!

69
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,860
I'm so angry!  This is just awful!

70
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,950
My makeup is ruined!

71
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,330
Cosmetics, cosmetics! I need cosmetics!

72
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,720
That, and my toe-shoes, clothes, weapons, and...

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,710
booze, tears, and Okama Way!

74
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,610
I wanna get down from here now.  I'm thirsty and hungry!

75
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,310
There's no cause for concern, Straw-chan!

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,150
Getting from Level 3 to
Level 4 is as easy as throwing up!

77
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,810
Seriously?!

78
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,410
Yep! Too, too easy! So easy! Way too easy!

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,460
There it is, Straw-chan.

80
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,510
Just climb the great, big wall over there.

81
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,430
The wall? You mean up there?

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,610
That's right.

83
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,990
But don't get so excited that you leap over it.

84
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,290
Right!

85
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,550
Hot hot hot hot HOT!

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,890
What's with that wall?

87
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,660
It's as hot as a frying pan!

88
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,320
A frying pan, huh? That's exactly right, Straw-chan!

89
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,370
So, you alright?

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,950
Ready, and...

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,020
Hot!

92
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,410
See this, Straw-chan? Look down there.

93
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,330
What's with this place?

94
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,320
There's so much hot air and smoke!

95
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,350
It's too hot to stand up!

96
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,490
Right?

97
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,110
However, the place below us is, indeed, where you wanted to go: Level 4, the Inferno Hell!

98
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,610
The Inferno.  That's below here?

99
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,830
Indeed.  As you said,

100
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,620
Level 4 is a massive frying pan.

101
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,630
A sea of boiling blood and fire wait for you down there.

102
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,820
You can try jumping down there, if you like,

103
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,660
but if you don't take care in landing, you won't escape with just a burn.

104
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,140
Beyond this point, every move forward is risking your life.

105
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,660
Bon-chan,

106
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,690
you said there was someone you wanted to see, right?

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,800
I'd like to know who this guy is you're risking your life to see.

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,800
People call him a "Miracle Man".

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,920
Locked away for a crime he didn't commit, he is known as Iva-san!

110
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,300
The Queen of Kamabakka Queendom on Momoiro Island in the Grand Line!

111
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,390
The great Okama Queen, admired by all Okama in the world!

112
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,140
Okama Queen?

113
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,940
Okama have queens? Awesome!

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,640
That's right!

115
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,860
I want to meet him!

116
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,360
And if I can, I'd like to save him!

117
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,590
Hey wait!  We were in such a nice mood here, and you go and bring THAT thing back here?!

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,570
I thought you were trying to escape!

119
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,350
STRAW HAT!

120
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,570
So you wanna come along after all?

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,690
As if anyone'd wanna go to Hell!

122
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,440
We were just hiding, and this thing just came flying at us!

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,790
I dunno why, though...

124
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,160
Oh, I sent him flying at you.

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,070
Oh, so it was you then?  WAIT JUST A MINUTE?!

126
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,570
I've had enough of this...

127
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,580
I'd rather just get caught...

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,310
Minotaurus, you... damn monster...

129
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,970
My life's at stake here...

130
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,070
I've got no choice but to reveal my trump card!

131
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,230
Hey, Straw Hat!

132
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,410
You remember my super-powerful weapon,

133
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,130
that I used to strike fear into your heart, my Special Buggy-ball?

134
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,820
Nah.

135
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,550
Well...What? Uh...

136
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,700
I had this really powerful cannonball called the Buggy-ball, you see...

137
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,180
It was like, my favorite weapon and stuff...

138
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,120
The Buggy-ball...

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,450
If you gave it your own name,

140
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,330
that must mean that you have a lot of faith in this Buggy-ball of yours, right?

141
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,760
Exactly!

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,850
And I've made a new weapon that lets me store a mini-version with the same power in my own body!

143
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,010
The "Muggy-Ball"!

144
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,720
You changed the name?!

145
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,130
Take this!

146
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,670
Special Muggy-Ball!

147
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,510
Awesome!

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,900
It worked!

149
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,020
Well, that's how it works.

150
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,170
How's that? Remembered it yet, Straw Hat?

151
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,130
Crap! It's still conscious?!

152
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,920
Let's do it, Straw-chan!

153
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,430
Hey, Three! You really can't use your Candle powers here?

154
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,250
It'll melt in just three seconds!

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,030
Then I'll have to do it in three seconds.

156
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,440
Flying, I'm flying! My flying Okama Kenpo!

157
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,030
Memoir of that Winter-Sky!

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,620
Here I go, Straw Hat!

159
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,290
Candle Lock!

160
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,870
Right!

161
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,740
Rubber...

162
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,500
Hammer Rifle!

163
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,840
We did it!

164
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,130
We beat a monster from hell!

165
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,880
Right! Now let's get going down to Level 4!

166
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,850
This is Level 4.

167
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,900
All our forces have assembled here except Warden Magellan.

168
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,850
Stay away,

169
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,800
Luffy...!

170
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,340
How much time is left before his execution?

171
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,430
29 hours.

172
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,820
Tomorrow at 15:00, this will all be over.

173
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,240
Of course, that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,410
We'll transfer Portgas D. Ace tomorrow morning.

175
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,200
Luffy...

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,790
As long as you are alright, I...

177
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,710
Vice-Admiral Momonga!

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,070
What is it?

179
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,880
Red Hair has apparently gotten involved in a fight in the New World!

180
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,590
Red Hair?

181
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,100
Are you sure about that?

182
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,660
Why now?

183
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,120
Against who?

184
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,370
Well... the Yonkou Kaidou!

185
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,310
Kaidou?!

186
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,080
According to HQ, Kaidou said he was gonna take down Whitebeard, and Red Hair stopped him.

187
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,270
However, it wasn't a very large battle...

188
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,460
That sort of thing was bound to happen!

189
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,330
My, how uneasy this sea has become.

190
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,530
With all that's going on now, we can't deal with fights between the Yonkou!

191
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:26,090
It's possible there's no way to avoid a fight with Whitebeard.

192
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,410
No matter who wins, this battle will be engraved in history.

193
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,100
Hurry, and set sail for Marineford!

194
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,580
Yes, Sir!

195
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,600
Impel Down

196
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,600
Inside the well-hole tower

197
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,770
How many times do I have to explain it, you freaking dumbass?!

198
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,100
Can't you see that pillar of steam?!

199
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,600
Spinning, spinning, spinning-ing-ing!

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,970
That's the Inferno Hell down there!

201
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,600
We're not going!

202
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,290
Not to a place like Level 4!

203
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,260
Why?

204
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,140
Whaddaya mean "Why"?!

205
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,850
We're trying to break out!

206
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,490
Break. Out. {I don't think I understand the reason for the tlc here. It makes sense as is.}

207
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,160
We wanna go up!

208
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,790
Up, fool!

209
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,150
Man, what a huge blood booger...

210
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,080
Hey, you listening?!

211
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,560
Just give it up, Straw-chan.

212
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,390
We don't need those spineless wimps.

213
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,450
WHO YOU CALLIN' A BIG-NOSED WIMP?!

214
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,470
What the hell?! How could you possibly mistake what I said for THAT?!

215
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,520
I've decided! I'm going 'round and 'round!

216
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,140
This ain't no joke!

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,550
Hey, the ceiling just keeps getting higher and higher...

218
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,820
You're right...

219
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,920
I was just wondering what kind of trick they were using to cause that cracking-sound...

220
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,560
We're the ones falling down!

221
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,750
Dammit! My Muggy-Ball was too powerful, and it caused the floor to crumble!

222
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,260
No, no, it was because my kicks were too fierce!

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,470
You're wrong, it was because my punch was too strong!

224
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,570
Oh, no, no... It was because my wax-powers were-

225
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,270
Oh, right, never mind.

226
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,510
It wasn't you, okay?!

227
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,930
We're gonna fall into the fire!

228
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,100
Help us!

229
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,880
“Pool of Blood“

230
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,410
Hey, cut it out!

231
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,990
We'll die!

232
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,440
You're just getting what's coming to you.

233
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,360
How many people have you killed up 'til now?

234
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,170
Do it.

235
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,020
We've had plenty of time to reflect over what we did!

236
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,660
That's right! We're sorry!

237
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,120
Stop it!

238
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,460
IT'S HOT! IT'S SO HOT!

239
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,520
SAVE US!

240
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,170
Carry the logs over there!

241
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,280
No slacking off!

242
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,050
So hot... It feels like my organs are boiling!

243
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,940
This floor is more painful than dying!

244
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,580
I've had enough!

245
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,900
Make way! Move it!

246
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,540
A prisoner is trying to escape!

247
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,220
Hey, move it!

248
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,350
You wanna get thrown into the sea of fire?!

249
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,930
You scum! Prisoners aren't allowed to harm other prisoners!

250
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,530
You wanna get executed right now?!

251
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,570
Former Baroque Works
Assassin, Daz Bones

252
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,570
Code name

253
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,610
What's going on?

254
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,300
Magellan, Hannyabal and all the
Demon Guards are gathered here!

255
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,980
What's gonna happen here on this floor?

256
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,750
Passage connecting level 3 and level 4

257
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,740
{\an8}It sure is hot down here!

258
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,880
Get your protective clothes on!

259
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,630
If Straw Hat Luffy and the others make it down here, it'll be through this door.

260
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,300
Still no reports?

261
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,940
Perhaps the Minotaurus killed them?

262
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,170
Warden, what're you doing, hiding in there like that?

263
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,780
Hurry up, and come out.

264
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,680
Don't just open it all of a sudden!

265
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
It's too bright!

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,950
Warden, about that Warden's seat...

267
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,000
When I take over your job, please change it to a less confined one.

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,830
Silence. This is the Warden's special seat.

269
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,420
I want to remain in a closed-up area.

270
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,700
I'd rather close my heart to you, too.

271
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,590
If we were gonna wait for this long, it'd have been better to just head...

272
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,690
straight to Level 3.

273
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,270
Now, don't be so impatient, Sadi-chan.

274
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,030
It's not me, I mean these kids.

275
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,100
They can't hold back their bloodthirstiness...

276
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,820
for very long.

277
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,300
Jailer Beast

278
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,300
Minokoala (Feasty)

279
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,420
Jailer Beast

280
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,420
Minorhinoceros (Quiet)

281
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,320
Jailer Beast

282
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,320
Minozebra (Shy)

283
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,650
Reporting in!

284
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,490
It appears that Straw Hat Luffy has entered the Vent Column in Level 3,

285
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,410
though we haven't been able to contact the surveillance.

286
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,250
If so, then he'll save us a lot of trouble if he falls down here.

287
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,640
That's the Pool of Blood beneath him.

288
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,060
Those guys all have Devil Fruit powers,

289
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,840
so if they fall in, they're dead.

290
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,110
Warden Magellan! I have something to report!

291
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,610
The intruder, Straw Hat Luffy, has already reached this floor!

292
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,250
What?!

293
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,330
What do you mean?!

294
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,340
Seems he fell down from the Vent Column.

295
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,830
But the Pool of Blood was right below the hole!

296
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,680
How'd he survive?!

297
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm just guessing, but he might have been able to leap to safety from the giant rock that fell down with them.

298
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,600
They got lucky.

299
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,900
Also...

300
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,550
What?

301
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,340
Warden, you stink!

302
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,810
Oh, I messed up.

303
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,320
I mean, this is such a pain!

304
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,530
The Demon Guard, the Minotaurus, seems to have been immobilized and has fallen down with them.

305
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,960
No way?! Did they defeat him?!

306
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,140
Probably.

307
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,020
That can't be! I refuse to believe it!

308
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,840
Calm down!

309
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,670
If they intend to escape from Level 4,

310
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,170
there are only two stairs they can use without security approval.

311
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,540
We will split the forces here into three squads.

312
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,810
Hannyabal, I'll leave the protection of this staircase leading to Level 3 to you.

313
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:53,000
Sadi-chan, you take the Demon Guards and guard the stairs leading to Level 5.

314
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,140
You're kidding! I don't want to stand guard...

315
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,000
I want to attack them!

316
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,180
There's no meaning to my life if I can't attack them, Warden!

317
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,900
If they come here, I'll just let them escape and push the blame on the Warden...

318
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,020
You got any complaints?

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,410
Oh, please stop...

320
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,040
sighing!

321
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,310
Why're you breathing on me too?

322
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,780
My instincts told me that you had evil intentions.

323
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,580
You can do whatever you want once you've captured them.

324
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,670
That's great! I can't wait!

325
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,370
All remaining Jailers, chase after them!

326
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,010
You have permission to kill them!

327
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,220
Yes, Sir!

328
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,930
But please, don't kill them completely!

329
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't underestimate me,
Straw Hat Luffy and your gang!

330
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,970
I won't let you have your way any longer!

331
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,270
I will settle this here, in Inferno Hell!

332
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,290
Hot!

333
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,540
What's up with this corridor, it's flashily hot!

334
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,990
Near the "Pool of Blood"

335
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,030
{\an8}The air is so hot, even my lungs feel hot!

336
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,490
{\an8}Hurry up! We've gotta hurry and get out of here!

337
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,180
{\an8}Which way should we go?

338
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,710
You guys are just helpless!

339
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,380
If you clear your mind, the fire is just another Okama.

340
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,850
Not that I don't understand how you feel, though.

341
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,470
This floor is even hotter than the one above us.

342
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,090
It IS kinda hot...

343
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,810
I DO kinda feel like I'm getting roasted here...

344
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
HOT!!!

345
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,040
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAN'T STAND THE HEAT!

346
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,440
Over there! Let's go!

347
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,140
Where're you going?!

348
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,640
HOT!!!

349
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,940
Be quiet!

350
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,360
HOT!!!

351
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,950
Wait... The place Straw-chan is running towards...

352
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420
Pool of Blood

353
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420
Current location

354
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420
Lift

355
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420
Inferno hell

356
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,420

Prisoner's Area

365
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,070
The kitchen is over there!

366
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,910
I'm starving too! Straw-chan, wait for me!

367
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,550
Fantastic! If they've got some booze there, it'll be perfect!

368
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,580
Wait, Buggy!

369
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,520
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!!!

370
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,360
Smells nice...

371
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,650
Hot, hot! Smells nice...

372
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,650
We've found him!

373
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,260
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

374
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,390
Sure are a lot of 'em!

375
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,180
This floor is way hotter than the one above, but when I get something to eat, I'll feel 100 times better!

376
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,520
Stop him!

377
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,130
Rubber...

378
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,420
Fireworks!

379
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
What's the big deal, partner?!

380
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,210
Take a good look.

381
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,710
The enemy are dropping like flies.

382
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,210
Also, Level 4 is known for its screams and torture,

383
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,430
but there's not a single Jailer guarding the fiery torture pits.

384
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,480
Up there! They're up there!

385
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,590
We've got to find out where the exit is while we have the chance!

386
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,740
We might get ambushed and trapped here on this floor!

387
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,260
Ambushed in Level 4?!

388
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,400
But they're after Straw Hat, right?!

389
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,630
It was just an accident that got us here!

390
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,000
Regardless, we've tried to escape, so both our names and faces have been revealed.

391
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,470
I'm afraid that...

392
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,720
there's a high chance that they've gathered

393
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,680
the All-Stars of Impel Down here on this floor, to take care off the riot.

394
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,310
The remaining three Demon Guards are a given...

395
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,600
but if Warden Magellan also shows up, we're done for!

396
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,870
Get out of my way!

397
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,610
Damn... I thought that was a spear or something...

398
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,910
What is that?

399
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,840
Jelly? Poop?

400
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
Straw-chan, look up there!

401
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,300
You've been running about freely for far too long!

402
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,970
Who're you?!

403
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,060
M-Magellan!

404
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,310
This is the end for you, persistent vermin!
