1
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,810
Scattered Evasion!

2
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,980
Now fall and prepare to have your brain splattered!

3
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,330
Mid-Air Spinning Big-Top!

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,520
How did ya' like that, ya' big sea gorilla!

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,390
Wha-?! It didn't work?!

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,430
That's dangerous!

7
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,300
S-Stop punching me!

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,310
S-Seems like you're a little stronger now...

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,640
Man, these guys're tough!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,810
What're these animals?

11
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,090
They're the Wrestlers of the Sea, the Blue Gorillas!

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,720
Or just Blugori.

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,260
Don't let your guard down! There's still four more of 'em...

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,730
You have already beaten them up!

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,670
But we don't have time to fight all these guys...

16
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,300
He's amazing! He beat the Blugori!

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,140
Hey, what are you?!

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,010
Please, open the lock for us!

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,370
What is it?

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,670
Wasn't there just one prisoner on the loose?

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,090
I'm pretty sure it was just one...

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,670
Maybe I'm seeing things, but I could've sworn I saw two shadows...

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,520
Anyway, five Blugori are down in front of Shared Cell 10.

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,250
Five? There's no way!

25
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,480
There aren't any Level One prisoners who can beat the Blugori!

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,270
What?!?!?!?!

27
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,980
You wanna save Ace?!

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,730
Yup.

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,490
Quiet!

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,040
You're the one who were shouting...

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,940
Hey, C'mon! Get the key to the cage...

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,170
That's enough out of you!

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,540
Shut up!

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,690
You know Ace?

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,090
Sure.

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,790
Unlike you, that brother of yours was a gentleman.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,830
After that, we had a blast, and wound up drinking buddies...

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,900
It's a shame what's happened to him.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,220
The nerve to lay a hand on Whitebeard's crew... The Navy sure is stupid.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,420
I wanna go to that Level Five place.

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,880
That's where Ace is, right?

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,340
Think I care?! If you wanna go, then go by yourself.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,310
Think we're friends or something?!

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,480
No way I'm going somewhere that dangerous.

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,980
See ya.

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,890
If you ain't leaving, I'll just escape on my own.

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,670
Even with over a dozen warships out there?

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,990
You really think you can get out?

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,360
A d-dozen?

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
I get it.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,100
They're preparing for Whitebeard's attacks...

52
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,650
Perhaps this is a bad time to leave.

53
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,040
Guess I could kill some time down here, then.

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,770
Oh well. I'll just ask someone else.

55
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,260
Please give us the key!

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,410
No, there's no way!

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,030
It just can't be!

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Could it be...?!

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,260
See ya. Good luck escaping.

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,270
There's no mistaking it.

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,010
Hey, wait, Straw Hat!

62
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,650
What the hell?!

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,130
There they are! Up there!

64
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,360
They found us!

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Why'd you have to shout?!

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,770
That bracelet of yours sure is nice!

67
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,910
Give it to me!

68
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,240
What're you talking about?

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,620
I got this from Nami!

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,990
I'll tell ya how to get to where Ace is!

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,850
Seriously?

72
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,170
Sure. Will you give me that bracelet?

73
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah, if you'll help. Okay.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,700
All right!

75
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,400
Then first, let's lose these guys!

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Carry my feet with you!

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,720
Feet?

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
Run, Straw Hat!

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,950
Explanation of Buggy The Clown's Bara Bara Fruit Power.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,460
He's able to split up his body and control each part separately.

81
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,400
However, his control is limited to a small field,

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,850
and his feet must remain on the ground while he's using his power.

83
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,100
What a stroke of luck this is!

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,070
Captain! Captain!

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,410
What?

86
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,500
Are you sure this is the spot?

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,590
The legendary cave Captain John dug out in order to hide his great treasure,

88
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,550
that he cruelly protected in the past?

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,250
Yeah, this is the place. Keep moving.

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,510
Right.

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
Listen up!

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,990
The treasures are guarded,

93
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,510
so if you let your guard down, you might not live that long!

94
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,610
Will we encounter monsters that would attack us,

95
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,110
or traps that you would see in Hell?

96
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,190
Right, let's do our best digging today, too!

97
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,280
Yes, Chief!

98
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,620
Oh? Are you the new guys?

99
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,860
Man, working up a sweat sure is great!

100
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,030
Indeed! And our sweat will eventually create a tunnel and become the people's smiles!

101
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,190
Yeah, yeah! After hard work, sake tastes a little better too!

102
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,460
What are you making me do here?!

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,380
Afterward, we went to and from on the Grand Line, searching for the treasure,

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,200
but we never found a single bit.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,430
I was arrested here after I messed up flashily and broke into a Navy base...

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,160
Then I was thrown into this prison.

107
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,330
But it seems my luck hasn't run out just yet!

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,670
Keep running as fast as you can, Straw Hat!

109
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll take you to Level Two!

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,840
Level Two? That's not it!

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,610
I wanna go to Level Five!

112
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,350
That's why I'm taking you there!
You can't just go straight to Level Five!

113
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,010
Listen up. The first undersea floor of Impel Down, where we are, is Level One.

114
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,680
As you descend into Level Two, Level Three, and below,

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,110
the prisoners will become more and more vicious.

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,720
I was sent all the way to Level Four and exposed to the Inferno,

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,500
but I don't know anything about the floors beneath that.

118
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,870
If I remember it right, Level Five is where the nastiest criminals with bounties above 100 million are kept.

119
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,580
But some of the prisoners say there's another level below that one, too!

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,990
They say it holds the villains so evil that they had to be erased from history itself!

121
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,730
It's just a rumor, but Ace might be down there.

122
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,850
Anyway, I can't take you any deeper than Level Four.

123
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,900
Really? You're a nice guy now?

124
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:47,340
Of course! I mean, you're giving me the Treasure Mark that'll lead me to Captain John's treasure!

125
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,850
I...I told him!

126
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,030
You're in here 'cause you're weak, right?

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,780
Don't be nosy! Leave me alone!

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,980
H-He didn't notice!

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,520
Good thing this guy's slow.

130
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,700
I see. So this bracelet is some sort of treasure-map-thingy, huh?

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,020
I had no idea!

132
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,350
You were paying attention then, dammit!

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,600
Well, now I have no choice!

134
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,200
Then I'll just let you have it right now.

135
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,020
You're... giving it to me knowing how valuable it is?

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,980
Sure. Saving Ace is more important to me anyway.

137
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,950
B-But if you give it to me now, I might just fly off and leave you here!

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,790
You could, but you said you'd show me the way, didn't you?

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,840
Don't look at me with honest eyes like that!

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,250
I'm just a cheap, worthless scumbag, ya know!

141
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,440
You can't just take my word!

142
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,600
The map to the treasure of my dreams...

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,530
Captain John's Treasure Mark.

144
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,010
I accept your offering!

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,850
I owe you one, Straw Hat!

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,340
Now, how do I get away from this guy?

147
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,820
Hm? So we'll get there faster if we break that wall?

148
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,990
Right! I'll handle it!

149
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,430
That's not...!

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,540
Who are these guys?!

151
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,460
That's Buggy the Clown, who escaped from his cell, and...

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,510
Who's that?! There are two of them!

153
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,490
This is the surveillance room!

154
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,180
Which means, breaking out of here would be a really bad idea!

155
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,680
Stop! Straw Ha-ugh...

156
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,760
What the hell is this place?!

157
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,570
A forest inside the prison?

158
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,700
A red forest?

159
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,410
There's lots of people down there, too!

160
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,310
Those're the prisoners!

161
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,950
This ain't no ordinary forest!

162
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,240
The blades on the trees are razor sharp.

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,830
They're the Sabertrees!

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,910
And the grass sticking up from the floor...

165
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,950
is the Needlegrass, which pierces your body like spikes!

166
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,000
Chased by poisonous spiders and jailers,

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,770
the prisoners run around getting cut by the leaves and the grass,

168
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,400
staining them with their blood!

169
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,860
Their punishment is being sliced up and covered in blood...

170
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,740
That is Level One, Crimson Hell!

171
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,150
This is what Impel Down is like!

172
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,920
Impel Down, the Underwater Prison  -  Level 1
Crimson Hell

173
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,750
Save me!

174
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,870
It hurts!

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,370
This really IS Hell!

176
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,410
Did Ace have to go through this too?

177
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,070
I Got it! We can just keep falling like this!

178
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,630
Why?! We'll get cut up!

179
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,340
I won't get cut!

180
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,250
Just shut up and hold on!

181
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,240
Straw Hat! My feet!

182
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,500
Throw my feet down there!

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,080
Feet?

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Right!

185
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,940
W-What is that?

186
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,020
That was close!

187
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,080
As long as I've got my feet on the ground, we'll be fine!

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,780
We don't need a staircase from this floor to the next!

189
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,580
We won't need an access key, either!

190
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,810
I just remembered, there's an escape route readied for anyone who wants to escape from the pain!

191
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,960
There's an escape route in Hell?

192
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,560
Take a look! This is it!

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,890
A hole?

194
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,160
It's pitch-black!

195
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,500
This is an escape route, but there's nobody who tries to escape through here.

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,580
You wanna know why, Straw Hat?

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,290
Because this escape route leads to Level Two!

198
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,800
It's connected to an even more terrifying Hell than this one!

199
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,670
There might be some who try to run from Hell and back up to the surface,

200
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,360
but there's nobody who'd be dumb enough to jump from the surface and into Hell!

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,820
I get it! This makes things a lot easier!

202
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
We've just gotta jump in, right?

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,940
Yes, but once we reach the bottom, we'll be in...

204
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,530
HEY! HEY!

205
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,990
This hole sure is deep! What's down there?

206
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,710
He has no self-control at all.

207
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,630
Ain't he afraid of anything?

208
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,700
Ah well...

209
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
If I run now, he won't follow me, after all!

210
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,460
I got away from 'im!

211
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,950
I finally got the marker for the treasure of my dreams!

212
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,010
Who'd want to lead the way in here?

213
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,990
See ya, Straw Hat!

214
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,870
Just go to Level Three or Level Four or whatever by yourself, and die!

215
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,790
You dumbass Blugori!

216
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm a scatter man. I won't get sliced up even if you cut me!

217
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,590
My feet...?

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,470
You're kidding!

219
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,320
This is the surveillance room!

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,890
There really was another one!

221
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,940
The two of them are falling toward Level Two!

222
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,180
Please confirm!

223
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,130
Understood!

224
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,770
Impel Down, the Underwater Prison  -  Level 2
Demonic Beast Floor

225
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,180
W-What? The monsters are agitated for some reason.

226
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,460
T-Think they're hungry?

227
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,300
I don't have the energy to be scared anymore...

228
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Sooner or later, we all become their fodder...

229
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,850
HUGE! IT'S AN ACCURSED BEAST!!

230
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,480
This man, he's...

231
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,780
Dammit! The rumors were true after all!

232
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,120
We're gonna die!

233
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
I never even wanted to come to Level Two!

234
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,100
I was plannin' to leave you behind and make a break for it!

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,830
Did you say something, Buggy?

236
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,950
Hey, what the hell is that?!

237
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,660
I think it's the rarest of mutants!

238
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,960
A snake hatched from a chicken's egg: a Basilisk!

239
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,960
Guard
Beast

240
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,370
Those things come from chickens?!

241
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,890
YOU KIDDIN' ME? THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A MONSTER!

242
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,680
Up on the surface, it'd just attack and eat people, so they had it brought down here as a guard.

243
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,500
What're you doing?!

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,280
I don't have time for this!

245
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,220
Right, just bring it on!

246
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,240
It is quite hot.

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,090
Yes, like the Assistant Warden told you earlier,

248
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,140
the Warden resides in Level Four, the Inferno.

249
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,630
There's an enormous fire surrounding this room.

250
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,790
We've arrived.

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,410
Where's the Warden?

252
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,540
Warden Magellan has diarrhea and spends about ten hours a day in the bathroom calming his stomach.

253
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,970
He spends another eight hours sleeping,

254
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,820
and taking his lunch and breaks into account,

255
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,090
he works about four hours a day.

256
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,600
And he still manages to keep his position as Warden?

257
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
He's quite reliable when it counts.

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,580
Sorry to have kept you waiting. Here he comes.

259
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,200
I forgot to mention, the Warden ate the Doku Doku Fruit.

260
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,200
{\an8}Doku = Poison

261
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,160
He's a poison man.

262
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,550
A poison man?

263
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,520
Please be careful.

264
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,700
Thank you for your hard work!

265
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,220
Welcome back from your noble task, Warden!!

266
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,310
As always, that was one hell of a battle.

267
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,790
You must be visitors.

268
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,490
I am the Warden, Magellan.

269
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,610
Impel Down Warden, Magellan

270
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,610
(Poison human who ate the Doku Doku Fruit)

271
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,940
Ah, so bright! Such a bright room!

272
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,490
I'd like to be in a darker, more confined room!

273
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,650
If I could, I'd keep my heart confined too!

274
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,360
Don't be ridiculous!

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,450
Warden, Vice Admiral Momonga and the Warlord Boa Hancock-dono are here to see you.

276
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,590
We're in a hurry, Warden Magellan.

277
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,730
Oh, I apologize.

278
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,350
Bit of a problem with runny stool.

279
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,980
I suppose the poison-soup I had for lunch did not agree with me.

280
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,950
Well, whaddya expect? It was poison!

281
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm a poison-man, so poisons are my favorite!

282
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,910
Besides, don't they say "poison quells poison"?

283
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,650
It's quelling it so well you've got diarrhea, then?

284
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,710
My, you're as poison-tongued as ever, Hannyabal.

285
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,310
Retire already, so I can take your post, plea-

286
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,500
Oh, whoops! I meant hurry and take them to Fire Fist Ace, please!

287
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,470
Too cruel! Your mistake was just too cruel!

288
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,330
I have such a heartless subordinate!

289
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,740
Take these.

290
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,480
H-Hey! B-Be careful when you exhale!

291
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,920
Your breath is poisonous, ya know...

292
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,480
Why are you laughing?!

293
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,920
Serves you right, foolish subordinate.

294
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,150
Your breath and your attitude are both poisonous!

295
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,230
What, exactly, were you attempting to have me inhale?!

296
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,050
Such insolence!

297
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,930
Ow! Such a beauty! I'm in love!

298
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,490
I'm so jealous...

299
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,390
Assistant Warden.

300
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,200
That's the Warden's seat.

301
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,990
It'll be mine eventually.

302
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,100
We're in a hurry!

303
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,650
Yes, this is the Warden speaking.

304
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,920
Why are YOU answering?!

305
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,610
Woe is me! I'm dying! God dammit!

306
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,580
I always wanted to be Warden...!

307
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,060
Prepare the antidote for the Assistant Warden.

308
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,210
Yes!

309
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,930
What?!

310
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,200
Intruders in MY Impel Down?!

311
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
Impossible!

312
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,430
Someone broke into Impel Down, which has never been breached since its founding?!

313
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,180
This is a horrible crisis!

314
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,910
The Warden's responsibility!

315
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,180
Could he have been spotted?!

316
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,100
Transfer all live camera feeds to me now!

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,520
Warden...

318
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,020
I would like to go see the prisoner as soon as possible.

319
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,570
Right, let's go! Going right now!

320
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,860
W-Warden! This is a major incident, you know!

321
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,430
That's odd...

322
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,910
I've lost contact with Warden Magellan.

323
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,080
In any case, hurry up and report this to all floors and Navy HQ!

324
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,800
I don't know how he got here or what he wants,

325
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,820
but the guy who's been running around Level Two with Buggy the Clown...

326
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,720
is without a doubt the pirate, Straw Hat Luffy!

327
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,170
We can't get in touch with the monitoring room on Level Two!

328
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,340
What?!

329
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,450
Level Two monitoring room! Did something happen?

330
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,750
Respond, monitoring room!

331
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,110
Right!

332
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,460
His hand just became huge!

333
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,560
What was that you did just now?!

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,110
It's Gear Third...

335
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,280
Seems we beat it somehow...

336
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,030
Right, I'm back to normal!

337
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,590
Let's hurry to Level Three!

338
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,860
The Gods have come to free us from Hell!

339
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,720
Amazing, they beat that monster!

340
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,060
They defeated the Basilisk!

341
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
You did it!

342
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,450
You guys're awesome!

343
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,860
What's more, you knocked it into the monitoring room!

344
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,540
Unbelievable! You guys're GODS!

345
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,810
I dunno who you are, but thanks!

346
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,010
Mind getting the keys for us?

347
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,160
The keys for the cages and handcuffs!

348
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,130
They've landed over there!

349
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,870
Is that...?

350
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,160
Let's keep going!

351
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,910
Don't be impatient.

352
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,210
I'm in a hurry!

353
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,340
Straw Hat Luffy!

354
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,070
Why is he here?!

355
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,180
No, I suppose him being out of his cage means that he MUST be trying to buy back his freedom!

356
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,450
I can take advantage of this, and use it as a chance to win back my freedom!

357
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,350
It would appear the God of Good Fortune has not yet abandoned me!

358
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,150
Want this, you guys?!

359
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,150
YEAH!

360
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,700
Of course we want it!

361
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,530
Hurry up and give it to us!

362
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,700
Is that the attitude you should have when asking someone a favor?

363
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,130
We're sorry!

364
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,660
Alright, I'll give them to you!

365
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,210
You should be grateful to me, the great Captain Buggy-sama!

366
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,100
Alright! It's open!

367
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,520
Be grateful, you fools!

368
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,450
Now, say the name of the man who freed you!

369
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,950
Captain Buggy!

370
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,900
We'll never forget what you did for us!

371
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,650
You're our savior, Captain Buggy!

372
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,420
That's it! Carve that name into your hearts!

373
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,970
Now unlock all the cages!

374
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,240
It was an accident that I fell down here,

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,510
but if I cause a riot, it'll be easier for me to escape!

376
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,560
Are you satisfied now?

377
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,580
Let go of me!

378
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,320
Now you've gotta help me out!

379
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,550
Hey, Straw Hat!

380
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
Hurry up and show me the way!

381
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,410
Is there a hole to take us down like before?

382
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,070
I don't know how to get to Level Three!

383
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,080
There's no way I'd remember all the
passageways in this maze of a prison!

384
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,870
Thanks, Captain Buggy!

385
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,210
Now we're free too!

386
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,680
Cut it out, Straw Hat!

387
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,740
What're you saying?!

388
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,900
You told me you'd guide me to Level Four!

389
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
That was a lie! A lie!

390
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,580
I just lied to get the treasure!

391
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,350
Now all the prisoners are gonna mess this floor up good!

392
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,490
You lied to me?!

393
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,230
What's up with you guys?!

394
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,710
Wasn't this your big chance to escape?!

395
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,130
Uh, looks like we got a little ahead of ourselves...

396
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,660
We don't have a chance here.

397
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,900
Not as long as the boss of this floor is here...

398
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,680
Yeah, we're better off inside the cells.

399
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,770
Right, Straw Hat! I'll tell you how to get to Level Three.

400
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,540
HEY! DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY YOU DIDN'T KNOW, YOU BIG NOSE?!

401
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,960
WHO'RE YOU CALLING A BIG NOSE?!

402
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,110
If you are having problems finding your way on this floor, how about I lend you a hand?

403
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,950
Who's that?

404
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,820
It has been a preciously long time, Straw Hat Luffy.

405
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,260
It seems that, thanks to you, I have become a free man.

406
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,140
I am a man who always repays his debts.

407
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,310
Who're you?

408
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,420
Oh, that "3" means...

409
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,640
You're the guy who was on the giants' island!

410
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,460
Three!

411
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,730
It's MISTER Three!

412
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,380
Prisoner Number D-0464
Origin: Baroque Works Agent
Mr. 3

413
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,380
Nobody's...

414
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,150
getting away!

415
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,450
I can't even scratch myself...

416
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,000
You got beaten up pretty badly, huh, boss?

417
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,120
It ain't my body that's in pain...

418
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,440
Ace-san...

419
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,670
the pain...

420
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,870
It lies in my heart, for being unable to do what's right!

421
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,360
Pirate of the Royal Seven Oceanic Warlords
First Son of the Sea, Jinbe
(Whale Shark Fishman,
Bounty: 250 million belly)

422
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,220
Jinbei...

423
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,480
As things are, I cannot accept death!

424
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,340
So what if they take my position as a Warlord of the Sea away?

425
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,190
I don't need it!

426
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,740
If only I could prevent this battle,

427
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,570
I would gladly give my life.
