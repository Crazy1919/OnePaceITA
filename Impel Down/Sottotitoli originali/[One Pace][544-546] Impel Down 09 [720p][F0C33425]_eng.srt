1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:23,640
From what I heard, you're the one who took down that former Shichibukai Crocodile over there, huh?

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,660
Straw Hat Luffy!

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,800
Back then, when I was still trying to become a Shichibukai,

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,170
I thought the best idea was to kill you and use that to prove my strength to the World Government.

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,050
Whitebeard's reign is over!
I'll become the next Pirate King!

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,140
For starters, I'm gonna kill
Straw Hat Luffy, who is in Water Seven,

7
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,960
as a gift to the Government!

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,980
Another reason I can't let you go free!

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,600
He's my brother!

10
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,140
But it seems fate was in your favor!

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,830
Ace, who had been chasing me ever since I broke the laws of Whitebeard's ship,

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,150
just happened to be your brother!

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,610
Once he realized that we were planning to kill his little brother,

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,030
he just had to fight us himself!

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,220
You understand?

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,720
If he'd let us go, not only would he have disgraced Whitebeard,

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,410
but his brother would have been killed, too!

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,650
There is no such thing as coincidence in one's fate.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,670
Meaning...

20
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,130
You got real lucky!

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,970
Now that the captain has become a Shichibukai, he has no need to take your life.

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,930
Your brother put up an admirable fight!

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,480
You should be thankful for Ace's interference.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,820
If he hadn't interfered, the one dying today, {here}

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,550
would be you, Straw Hat.

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,470
In that case...

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,100
WHY DON'T YOU TRY KILLING ME NOW?!

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,770
Captain!

29
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,790
I'm not letting Ace die!

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,930
Gomu Gomu no Jet...

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,140
Black Vortex!

32
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,940
Straw-chan!

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,330
Blood? Isn't he a rubber man?

34
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,150
Devil Fruit powers are useless against me!

35
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,680
And so what?!

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,010
Wait, Luffy-kun! Stop!{Jinbei just casually steps in the way of Luffy mid-attack. how cool is he?}

37
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,750
Let me go!

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,480
This is not the time! Just endure it!

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
Let go of me!

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,880
You can't, Luffy-kun!

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,780
What's more important here?!

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,450
Think! Luffy-kun!

43
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,880
Ever since he was on old Whitebeard's ship, no one's ever known his true nature.

44
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,800
I don't know what tricks he used, but he certainly possesses the power to defeat even Ace-san!

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,440
We can't afford to waste time and energy here!

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,290
If you get carried away and fight him now,

47
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,480
we won't have time to save Ace-san afterward!

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,650
You're even stronger than I had imagined.

49
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,580
Your haki has increased, too.

50
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,200
You said you're Blackbeard, right?

51
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:04,000
I'd heard that some no-name pirate from Whitebeard's crew had taken my place in the Shichibukai.

52
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,620
But isn't this odd?

53
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,930
Why would you, who's been called to Navy HQ, be down here right now?

54
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,850
You're pretty much throwing away the
Shichibukai rank that you wanted so badly.

55
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,130
It's all part of my plan.

56
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,780
It's not like I'm obligated to tell you anything...

57
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,590
...Mister Crocodile.

58
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,340
That's true, and to be honest, I don't really care.

59
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,580
Pretty touchy, aren't you?

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,480
H-Hey wait! What's going on?!

61
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,380
Magellan is here!

62
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,480
This is not good!

63
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,090
Straw-Hat-boy!

64
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,550
Hurry up and go!

65
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,890
If vyou're hit by any more of Magellan's poison, Vi won't be able to bring vyou back again!

66
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,280
It's Prison Warden Magellan!

67
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,440
Oh, crap... Hurry up and run!

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,010
Warden... Magellan!

69
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,190
Thank God... The Warden is here!

70
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,030
Magellan... So he finally shows himself?

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,570
Climb the stairs! The bazooka squad's gone!

72
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,790
The path is clear!

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,840
Straw Hat! Hurry and climb up to Level Three!

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,930
You took out the guards blocking the stairs... That makes things easier for us.

75
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,690
Well, you guys helped us too.
All this panic is real convenient for us.

76
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,160
Alright! It's the stairwell to Level Three!

77
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,160
Let's get moving!

78
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,310
It's another Demon Guard!

79
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,280
It's the Minotaurus!

80
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,780
What?! The Minotaurus?!

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,870
Didn't we beat that thing back in Level Three?!

82
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,910
Of course it recovered.

83
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,560
They're awakened Zoan-type Fruit users.

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,290
They're much tougher and recover much faster than normal people.

85
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,030
Those things are Devil Fruit users as well?!

86
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,700
If we stay here for too long, the other three will get up again too.

87
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,870
But this is not the time to be scared of those things.

88
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,420
The boss of Hell is just around the corner.

89
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,970
Warden Magellan!

90
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,410
We've received word that Blackbeard is on this floor, at the stairwell to Level Three!

91
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,510
Shiryuu should have already dealt with Blackbeard!

92
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,000
Was he defeated?

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,630
This is the monitoring room!

94
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,440
What's happening?!

95
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,600
I-It's terrible!

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,250
The main Surveillance Snail was taken out!

97
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,240
The monitoring system for the entire prison has been destroyed!

98
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,950
What's more, all connections to Navy HQ and the Government have been severed!

99
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,710
We've completely lost contact with-

100
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,290
What's this?!

101
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,260
Hey! What's wrong?! What happened?!

102
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,930
Who did this?!

103
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,230
Don't go tattling on me...

104
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,850
Or Magellan will know I'm here.

105
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,560
We've lost contact!

106
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,940
Send someone to confirm the situation!

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,850
Yes, Sir!

108
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,170
This is not good.

109
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,520
If Blackbeard is on this floor,

110
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,380
it means he has unsealed the door that I sealed on Level Two!

111
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,760
Everything seems to be going wrong here!

112
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
This entire mess has broken out because we allowed one little mouse to break in!

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,990
Buggy!{Socky}

114
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,100
Mister Three!{supie}

115
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,000
Buggy!{Socky}

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,730
Mister Three!{supie}

117
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,440
Yeah! We got flashily lucky!

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,610
Men! We're finally on Level One!

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,560
Everyone! We're about to reach the outside, where the sun shines!

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,250
Our great savior, Captain Buggy!

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,330
I'm definitely going to save Ace!

122
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,210
Sure, I won't say it's useless.

123
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,920
After all, there's no such thing as "impossible" in this world.

124
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,170
Sky Island did exist, didn't it?

125
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,940
The era where pirates dream is over?!

126
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,830
Huh?!

127
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,640
People's dreams...

128
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,250
NEVER END!

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,920
Ain't that right?!

130
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,280
One Piece is the same.

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,590
It definitely exists!

132
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,770
Look forward to it, you guys!

133
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,530
In just a few hours,

134
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,700
we will give you all a show that'll shake the world to its core!

135
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,220
Don't bother with him, Luffy-kun!

136
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,130
Advance!

137
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,580
To Level Three!

138
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,300
Warden!

139
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,190
Help me, Warden!

140
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,150
Sadi-chan! What happened to you?!

141
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,130
Okamakov...

142
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,630
Beat me!

143
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,050
I'm so ashamed!

144
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,440
There's no reason for me to live if I can't torture people!

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,870
Let her down.{he should've left her there}

146
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,430
I'll go on ahead.

147
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,220
Uh, yes! Right away!

148
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,300
So you're Magellan?

149
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,940
And I take it you are Blackbeard?

150
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,610
I am indeed.

151
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,620
Hydra!

152
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't have time to ask why you're here.

153
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,260
It hurts! What is this?!

154
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,060
Poison? Damn that bastard...!

155
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,480
Hannyabal.

156
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,110
You did well to hold them back for so long.

157
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,200
Leave the rest to me.

158
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,070
Assistant Warden!

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,500
What a disgraceful appearance!

160
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,260
Take care of him for me.

161
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,530
Yes, Sir!

162
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,090
Assistant Warden! Hang in there! Assistant Warden!

163
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,050
Don't die.

164
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,140
I won't accept anyone but you as my successor.

165
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,260
Straw Hat...

166
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,980
How did you survive my poison?

167
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,670
I'm sure he's the one in charge of this whole incident.

168
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,870
I will absolutely finish him off this time!

169
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:54,130
STRAW HAT!!!

170
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,440
Who's that?! Is that Magellan's voice?!

171
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,390
He's at the bottom of the stairs!
If he catches up to us, we're finished!

172
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,690
The poison guy!

173
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,390
I will never let you get away!

174
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,620
Straw-chan! Don't look back, just keep running!

175
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,530
I won't let you get away.

176
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,360
Get moving!

177
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,780
Hurry! Magellan is close!

178
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,880
Hurry to Level Two!

179
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,250
That was the last group.

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,020
Of all those behind them, not a single man was left standing!

181
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,360
Inazuma.

182
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,640
Understood.

183
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
Great Scissors!

184
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,700
Inazuma-san!

185
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,010
Why'd you slice up the stairs?!

186
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,660
Iva-sama is still down there!

187
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,180
Never mind that, just hurry and get off this floor!

188
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,980
Please... Survive!

189
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,400
What...

190
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,470
Is the meaning of this?!

191
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,070
"What is the meaning?" vyou ask?

192
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,730
If vyou don't understand what the meaning of that move was...

193
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,020
Then vyou're...

194
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,520
A TOTAL IDIOT, AREN'T VYOU?!

195
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,440
Death Wink!

196
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,250
I won't let Straw Hat and the others escape while you're stalling for time!

197
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,470
Stalling for time?

198
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,570
Vyou don't actually think you can beat me, do vyou?

199
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,840
Vi will show you the true power of the
Newkama Kenpo of the Kamabakka high temple!

200
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,830
Alright, get out here! The outside world awaits you!

201
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,570
Thank you, Captain Buggy!

202
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,450
Alright!

203
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,810
We're free!

204
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,340
Now make sure you work hard, alright?

205
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,380
Here.

206
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:40,880
Thanks.

207
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,050
Take this.

208
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,190
Advance! Keep moving!

209
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,730
Once trapped on Level Two by Magellan's poison but fortunately managing to escape,

210
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,990
Captain Buggy and his merry prisoners are now heading to the front entrance.

211
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,490
They are currently on Level One.

212
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,360
Having made it through Level Four,
Inferno Hell and Level Three, Famine Hell,

213
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,420
Straw Hat Luffy, the Newkama troops he commands, and the released prisoners...

214
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,170
are now running through Level Two, the Accursed Beasts Floor.

215
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,810
And the ruler of Hell, Warden Magellan, who is trying to catch them,

216
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,600
is currently fighting Okama Queen Ivankov, on Level Three.

217
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,650
He broke...

218
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,520
My spine...

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,230
D-Damn you, Ivankov!

220
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,320
I won't forgive you!

221
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,210
Get going!

222
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,880
How long...

223
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,840
Are you gonna sleep for?!

224
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,850
And the four Demon Guards, having just recovered from their earlier beating,

225
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,360
are in the lift, heading for Level One.

226
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,960
The traitorous Head Jailer, Shiryuu, has blocked all communication with the outside world.

227
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,860
No one has received word on the current state of the prison.

228
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,830
As this unprecedented incident continues to escalate beneath the sea...

229
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,460
Warships and prison ships are stationed all around the prison!

230
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,170
If we can hijack one of them, we should be able to reach Marineford before Ace-san is executed!

231
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,050
Right!

232
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,530
Wait for me, Ace!

233
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,490
Four and a half hours remain before Ace's rapidly approaching execution.

234
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,170
Long-johns!

235
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
Chemise!

236
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,080
That's weird...

237
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,920
The poison guy was right behind us a second ago...

238
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,890
Iva-san and Inazuma stopped him at the bottom of the stairwell!

239
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,730
Then they're fighting against the poison guy right now?

240
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,520
Let's go back!

241
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,060
Stop kidding around!

242
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,190
If they are fighting, then that makes it all the more important for us to move forward!

243
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,530
Let's believe in the power of the Miracle Worker!

244
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,950
Spin, spin!

245
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,460
What's wrong with this floor?

246
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,660
It's completely deserted.

247
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,180
Strange...

248
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,850
There's no sign of prisoners in any of the cells.

249
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,410
And all the cells are already open, too!

250
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,310
Who let them out?

251
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,060
Vmy face...

252
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,140
VMY FACE IS MELTING!

253
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,610
Vmy face... Vmy face...!

254
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,660
Vmy face... Vmy face...!

255
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,290
It's... It's... It's...

256
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,970
NOT MELTING!

257
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,840
Vi was just wearing lots of makeup!

258
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,790
What a frivolous waste of time!

259
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,670
Is that so?

260
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,420
Vi found it funny, though.

261
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,000
Then how about vwe end this?

262
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,110
This battle between vyou and vme?!

263
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,240
Newkama Kenpo...

264
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,600
Aesthetic Art 44 Hidden Technique...

265
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,500
Dream Smash Removal Fist!

266
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,210
Iva-san!

267
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,500
Iva-san...!

268
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,630
It didn't work?!

269
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,270
Keep Out!

270
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,430
Another attempt to stall for time?

271
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,480
They're here!

272
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,900
We finally made it here, and now all four Demon Guards are here too!

273
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,670
Run!

274
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,120
This is as far as we go! Let's turn back! We can't win!

275
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,790
Let's just give up on escaping!

276
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,370
WHAAAAAT?!

277
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,410
Are you alright?

278
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,880
Hey! Watch it, you crock o-

279
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,810
-DILE?! {Yeah, I couldn't really think of any way to make this sound good.kae: I went with 'crock of shit' getting truncated. it might be over-localized, but buggy is weird.}

280
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,770
B-B-B-B-Boss?!

281
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,170
So it's you, Mister Three.

282
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,270
What's a worthless piece of trash like you doing here?

283
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,980
That's quite a big shot they've released...

284
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,780
C-Captain Buggy!

285
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,000
They've knocked out the Demon Guards!

286
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,540
S-Straw Hat?!

287
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,650
I-Is that the Shichibukai, Jinbei?!

288
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,670
What a relief! So you guys are alright?

289
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,420
{\an8}(What a relief! So you guys are alright?)

290
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,430
My heart!

291
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,090
It hurts!

292
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,000
Captain Buggy!

293
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,730
Prisoners and perverts just keep coming up from Level Two!{what a line!}

294
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,070
Perverts too?!

295
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,930
What the hell?!

296
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,980
Who're you calling perverts?!

297
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,100
You two... How dare you abandon us back there?

298
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
So you're here too, Mister Two?!

299
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,280
What are you doing to Captain Buggy?!

300
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,340
This is bad!

301
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,580
The prisoners from Level Four have finally made it up here!

302
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,970
Did they manage to escape from Warden Magellan?

303
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,260
How can this be?

304
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,110
The two insurgent groups have joined forces!

305
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,820
Where is the Warden?!

306
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,660
Hydra!

307
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,260
MAGELLAN TOO?!

308
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,560
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE ON THIS FLOOR?!

309
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,550
Huh?! Does that mean that Iva-chan and Crab-chan were...

310
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,910
Dammit!

311
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,460
You can't, Straw-chan!

312
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,540
We've got no choice but to run from Magellan!

313
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,740
Let go of me, Bon-chan!

314
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,180
I'm gonna kick his ass!

315
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,410
Are you sure?

316
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,250
I understand, but do you really want us to?

317
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,650
Yes. Follow my orders, and do it quickly!

318
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,440
Yes, Sir!

319
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,660
Oh no, so that's their plan?!

320
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,000
You almost died because of him, remember?!

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,920
But I'm still alive, aren't I?

322
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,760
Miracles are called that because they won't happen twice, you know!

323
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,810
You two, hurry to the next floor!

324
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,520
Luffy-kun!

325
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,900
We must hurry to the main entrance!

326
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,200
The situation has gotten worse...

327
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,140
We've been too focused on Magellan!

328
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,420
Hydra!

329
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,510
Everyone, get out of the way!

330
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,260
Candle Wall!

331
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,670
Three!

332
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,050
He stopped Magellan's Hydra!

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,890
That optimism of yours makes me want to puke!

334
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,580
The second I let my guard down, I start thinking of you as a friend!

335
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,020
Sheesh...

336
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,820
I hate being indebted to others!

337
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,240
I've underestimated you, Brother Three!

338
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,120
I see. Wax, huh?

339
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,830
That's right.

340
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,540
I ate the Doru Doru fruit. I'm a candle-man.

341
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,520
Your poison will never be able to pass through my hard-as-steel wax wall!

342
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,040
You never know how suitable some powers can be.

343
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,270
Now, hurry up and go!

344
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,950
I give up quickly, you know!

345
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,040
Three!

346
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,370
How irritating.

347
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,340
This is no time to be hesitating! I can't hold him back for long!

348
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,850
Right. Then we'll just get going.

349
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,980
Let's go, men!

350
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,960
Were you always this good?!

351
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
Yeah, as long as I'm not on a hot floor...

352
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,100
Now all of you, hurry and get out!

353
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,520
I want to escape too, you know!

354
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,580
Luffy-kun. We must hurry as well!

355
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,630
Oh, yeah, you said we're gonna steal a warship, right?

356
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,890
I did.

357
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,250
Then you and the others should just go on ahead.

358
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,450
I'll try stopping the poison guy in the meantime.

359
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,320
I mean, it'll be hard to steal one while he's chasing us.

360
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
Yes, that's true...

361
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,920
I've got an idea.

362
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,170
Does it stand a chance?

363
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,540
Yeah, leave it to me!

364
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,340
I understand. Just don't do anything too reckless!

365
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,920
Right, Three! Let's fight together!

366
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,990
No, that's wrong! I have absolutely no intention of fighting!

367
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,270
My only intent was to guard us the best I could and run away!

368
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,870
Brother Three! We'll stay behind and help, too!

369
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,470
I'm telling you, I'm not that motivated!

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,890
THIS IS JUST TOO COOL!

371
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,350
It's perfect!

372
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,930
Pay attention to what's in front of you!

373
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,150
What are you talking about, at a time like this?!

374
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,830
The tears just won't stop...!

375
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,910
Thanks for making me look so awesome...!

376
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,700
Like I care! Hurry up and fight him!

377
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,910
H-Here he comes!

378
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,740
Hydra!

379
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,370
Three!

380
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,290
Leave it to me!

381
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
Candle Wall!

382
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,540
No matter how many times you try, it won't work!

383
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,300
Gomu Gomu no...

384
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,020
Champion Rifle!

385
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,640
Alright! I can touch him now!

386
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,570
We've got the cannons ready over here!

387
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,650
The candle wall is shielding us!

388
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,970
Awesome! We hit him!

389
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,700
We can do this!

390
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,670
Alright!

391
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,880
We're almost there! Push for the surface!

392
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,090
Just a little further!

393
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,420
We can finally get out!

394
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,130
Since we've made it this far, there's nobody left who can call themselves our enemies!

395
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,280
Don't let your guard down, amateur.

396
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,410
What?!

397
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,890
Outside these walls, there are at least ten warships.

398
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,690
There are about eight hundred marines on each ship.

399
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,850
I don't know what kind of plan they've got to intercept us,

400
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,400
but stealing one of the ships means we'll be making the other ships our enemies.

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,530
This is no time to take it easy.

402
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,040
I-I see...

403
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,860
That's not the only problem here.

404
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,240
There's no guards left!

405
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,310
Now we just have to get through this door!

406
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,790
Right! Prepare your weapons, all of you!

407
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,210
Let's open the door!

408
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,110
Let's do this! Ready, push!

409
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,160
Finally, we'll see the light of the outside world!

410
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,420
Idiot! We're not out of this just yet!

411
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,010
The navy troops are waiting right outside this door...

412
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,790
If we win, we'll reach Heaven! If we lose, we'll go to Hell!

413
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
It's light!

414
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,950
We're getting out of here!

415
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,120
All of you, put some spirit into it!

416
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,750
I don't know how many troops are waiting for us, but we will beat 'em and return to sea!

417
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,130
Now, let's go, men!

418
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,490
Now, let's go, men!

419
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,020
Follow my lead!

420
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,800
What... is going on here?!

421
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,860
There aren't any warships around!

422
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,720
There's not a single warship for us to steal!

423
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,690
There isn't a single marine here, either!

424
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,670
No way... That means...

425
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,410
There's no way out, is there?!

426
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,960
What are we gonna do?

427
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,130
Is there nothing to do...

428
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,500
but wait helplessly for Magellan to arrive?

429
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,920
Damn it! You gotta be kidding me!

430
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,890
I see. So the enemy wasn't as stupid as I thought.

431
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,900
The great Sea Kings are lurking on the ocean floor.

432
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,770
This Calm Belt here is truly
Impel Down's greatest defense.

433
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
We finally made it all the way here, from the depths of Hell!

434
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,440
Damn! At this rate, we'll only fall right back into Hell!

435
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,410
We have no time to stand around crying!

436
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,700
Magellan ordered them to set sail just a few minutes ago.

437
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,830
Take a good look!

438
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,250
You can still barely see their shadows through the mist!

439
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,370
Y-You're right!

440
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,760
But how is being able to see them in the distance gonna help us?!

441
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,340
Don't worry!

442
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,010
I'm here! You can leave this to me!

443
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,100
Seriously?!

444
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,310
He's freakishly strong!

445
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,380
All those who have the resolve to fight, get on!

446
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,090
Right, let's move out!

447
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,550
Very well! Let us hurry!

448
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,230
He's surging forward while carrying that heavy door!

449
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,810
Just what I'd expect from the captain of the Fishman Pirates!

450
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm really getting excited here!

451
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,610
I never thought I'd see a Shichibukai in action!

452
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,530
Not only that, but our savior, Captain Buggy, is with them!

453
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,080
There's still hope for us!

454
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,540
You dumbasses!

455
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,420
It's obviously much safer with these Shichibukai than staying there and dreading Magellan!

456
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,920
Fools!

457
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,660
They're shooting at us!

458
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,160
So they spotted us. {sexy voice}

459
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,580
He dodged it! He's fast!

460
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,000
Don't think he's just any fishman! He's the Sea Knight, Jinbei!

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,380
All ships, fire!

462
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,460
If we just sink Jinbei, they're all done for!

463
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,890
Warships coming in hard and fast!

464
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,480
I'll launch you onto the deck of one of the ships! Hold on tight!

465
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,860
What?! What did you say?!

466
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,070
You damn fish!

467
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,240
You listening, bastard?!

468
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,820
WHAT IS GOING ON?!

469
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,450
I see! He abandoned us and ran off on his own!

470
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,410
TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR!

471
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,410
Why did you even come along?

472
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,920
They'll hit us if this keeps up!

473
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,500
Just calm down, you.

474
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,550
Fishman Jujutsu...

475
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,850
Water Heart...

476
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,650
IT'S COMING THIS WAY!

477
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,910
Sea Current Lifter!

478
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,210
WE'RE FLYING!

479
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,050
What's that water pillar?

480
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,720
It's almost like a living creature!

481
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,760
What could that be?!

482
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,270
I don't know.

483
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,310
But someone's riding it... It's Crocodile!

484
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,450
Here they are!

485
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,450
They've come to steal the ship!

486
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,580
Don't let them take it!

487
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,710
If we can push the Devil Fruit users into the ocean, we win!

488
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,670
Huh?
