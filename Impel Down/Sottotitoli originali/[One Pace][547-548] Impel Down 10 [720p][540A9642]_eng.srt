1
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,650
Hey.

2
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,580
Who are you going to push into the sea?

3
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,200
Seems you don't know your opponents.

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,290
Don't hold back! Throw them overboard!

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,100
What's that?

6
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,900
It's Jinbei!

7
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,340
Fishman Karate!

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,030
Spear Wave!

9
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,970
Hey!

10
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,570
Oh, how careless of me.

11
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
That's the ship we're gonna use, isn't it?

12
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,520
Gomu Gomu no...

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
Oh no! Oh no! Run away, Straw Hat!

14
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,810
Champion Stamp!

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,190
It's no good! My wax won't work against him now!

16
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,490
Doru Doru Cancellation!

17
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,390
That was close!

18
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,450
Venom Demon!

19
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,540
Let's get out of here!

20
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,260
Hurry!

21
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,970
Hell's Judgement!

22
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,430
Damn it all!

23
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,800
Hey... Help me!

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,020
Take me with you!

25
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,930
You idiot! Don't touch me!

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,350
The poison is... spreading!

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,810
Doesn't matter if it's wax or stone...

28
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,070
The poison keeps spreading like an infection!

29
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,530
Damn it! Now the Doru Doru armor is completely useless!

30
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,410
Impel Down Main Entrance

31
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,990
What happened to Straw-chan and the others?

32
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,470
How's it going with the warships?

33
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,120
I can hear gunfire, but I can't really tell what's happening in that mist!

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm sure they'll be able to steal one of the warships, but...

35
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,080
In any case, they're pretty far away.

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,140
It's going to take a while for them to steal one and then bring it back.

37
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,140
Doesn't that mean that Magellan might get here first?

38
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,530
Straw Hat Luffy is strong and all but...

39
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,790
I doubt he'll be able to hold Magellan back very long...

40
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
Straw-chan...

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,090
Damn it! Please hurry, Jinbei!

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,930
Force them into the sea! Don't let them take the ship!

43
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,890
What's with this guy's body?!

44
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,820
His whole body is made of blades!

45
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,990
It's the Supa Supa Fruit.

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,990
{\an8}Supa Supa: Sound of slicing

47
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,900
I just remembered who this guy is!

48
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,680
He's the West Blue assassin, Daz!

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Sables!

50
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,260
It's only a matter of time before they take the ship!

51
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,450
That would be a huge disgrace for the Navy!

52
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,810
Sink it, immediately!

53
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,510
Yes, Sir!

54
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,870
Prepare to attack!

55
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,200
It's that thing from before!

56
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,330
Damn it, our gunpowder's all wet!

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,620
Jinbei, huh?!

58
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,460
Load another battery, and shoot him!

59
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,920
Hurry! Hurry! He's right behind us!

60
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,700
Hey! Guys, are you there?!

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,070
That's Straw-chan's voice!

62
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,000
We've gotta run!

63
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
There's some monstrous thing chasing after them!

64
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,630
It's Magellan! There's nowhere to run!

65
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,930
We got a warship yet?!

66
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,700
Straw-chan! We're still waiting for a ship to get on!

67
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,270
What?!

68
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,660
Hell Wink!

69
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,060
Iva-chan?!

70
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
What a surprise!

71
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,680
It... It seems Vi made it in time...

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,280
He hit the back of his head so hard he passed out!

73
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,580
Iva-san! And Inazuma, too! You're alive!

74
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank goodness!

75
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,170
Iva-sama!

76
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,500
Those two!

77
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,010
Straw Hat! It's from Jinbei!

78
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,890
A Baby Snail Phone!

79
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,030
Well done, you two!

80
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,550
Why did you even come along?

81
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,010
Luffy-kun, so you made it?

82
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm here! He's still chasing us, though!

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,630
We're gonna hit a dead end at the exit!

84
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,110
Forgive me. We've stolen a ship, but we're too far away from you!

85
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,730
But don't stop moving!

86
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,000
Jump straight into the sea!

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,510
Get everyone to throw themselves into the ocean!

88
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,440
What are you saying, Jinbei?!

89
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,040
We're in the Calm Belt, you know!

90
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,120
You can leave the rest to me!

91
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,960
Do what he says!

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,610
Wha-?!

93
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,490
Three! Come help me one more time!

94
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,640
Are you insane?! If we leap into the ocean, we'll die for sure!

95
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,040
He works for the Government! He's not worthy of our trust!

96
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,700
That damn Fishman bastard!

97
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,970
He's Ace's friend!

98
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,980
I trust him!

99
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,880
To the sea? If you think you can, then just try and get away!

100
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,430
The moment you touch the water, you'll be in the Sea Kings' nest!

101
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,330
Be careful! Don't let even a drop of his poison touch you!

102
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,570
That's impossible!

103
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,250
It's over!

104
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,340
Hell's Judgement!

105
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,020
Gear Third!

106
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,450
This is a special service!

107
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,320
Candle Wall!

108
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
It's pointless!

109
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,440
Gomu Gomu no...

110
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,600
Gigant Stamp!

111
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,630
He pushed him back!

112
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,240
The poison's still coming toward us!

113
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,790
Jumping into the sea is our only hope?!

114
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,110
Here it comes!

115
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,870
Iva-chan! Iva-chan, wake up!

116
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,420
We're in trouble!

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,990
Iva-chan! Wake up!

118
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,540
Hey! Hurry and wake up!

119
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,890
Hmm? What?

120
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,390
We gotta hurry!

121
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,890
Who are vyou? Straw Hat Boy's son?

122
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,890
Use that move of yours!

123
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,060
The Wink!

124
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay then.

125
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,050
Hey, you can't be serious! If we do that...

126
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,430
Here Vi go!

127
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,470
Hey, wait a second, Iva-sama!

128
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,080
Your plan is pointless!

129
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,180
If you enter the sea without a ship, there's no hope for you!

130
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
Everyone, grab on to his face!

131
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,650
His face?!

132
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,820
I will not let you escape!

133
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,320
Hell...

134
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
Wink!

135
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,120
You won't get away!

136
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,250
We're falling!

137
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,100
There's something under the ships!

138
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,400
What is that?!

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,070
What?

140
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,270
W-We landed on something!

141
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,830
Hey! Look at this!

142
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,450
What is this?!

143
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,860
So you made it in time...

144
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,380
I'm sorry for calling you out to such a dangerous sea!

145
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,200
It's a school of whale-sharks!

146
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
Jinbei called them here!

147
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,860
Awesome!

148
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,570
He's amazing!

149
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,200
Awesome!

150
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,050
We did it! We've finally reached the warship!

151
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,760
We managed to escape!

152
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
It's like I'm dreaming! I never thought I'd make it out of Impel Down! {here}

153
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,380
We don't have time to celebrate yet!

154
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,090
We've got to hurry and get out of here!

155
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,490
We did it!

156
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,500
Thanks, whale-sharks!

157
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,080
You saved us!

158
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,000
Be careful on your way back!

159
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,190
Vwe have to cure Inazuma's poisoning.

160
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,360
Bring all the medicine vyou can find in the medical office!

161
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,260
Yes!

162
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,210
I'm never going back to that Hell!

163
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,420
Me neither! I'm turning over a new leaf! I'm gonna go home and be with my family!

164
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,900
We are free!

165
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,220
And who do you have to thank for that?

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,800
Go on, say it!

167
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
Captain Buggy!

168
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,520
I never thought they'd make it that far...

169
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,430
Marines, send one of your ships back here.

170
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,160
I'll come with you, and take them down myself.

171
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,130
Understood.{here}

172
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,390
It looks like they haven't noticed that they're trapped yet.

173
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,130
Rear Admiral! We have repaired the cannons that Jinbei disabled.

174
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,870
Very well.

175
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,250
All ships, open fire!

176
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,490
They've started shooting!

177
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
This is really bad!

178
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,640
How many ships are there, anyway?!

179
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,080
The entire fleet is chasing us!

180
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,050
We're hit!{here}

181
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,460
Everyone ranked Vice Admiral or above has already been called to Marineford...

182
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,780
but a warship is a warship. They're still tough, no matter who's onboard!

183
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,410
Don't you realize that it's useless?!

184
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,120
The Gates of Justice won't open...

185
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,800
to pirate scum like you!

186
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,220
That's right! I forgot about this!

187
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,460
This is bad! These gates will never open for us! {Trying to implement Mr. 3's "randomly ending his words with the word money"-speech quirk in these next few lines so that this dialogue will make sense...}

188
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,060
Oh no! We've made it this far, and now we've hit a dead end!{it's too subtle to translate Mr 3's speech quirk. And I think he's just saying the
2 particles "ga" and "ne" instead of "money". For the "dont imitate me" part we can
just make Luffy sound all panicky instead of introducing all these extra lines.}

189
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,270
Don't imitate me! {here}

190
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,440
What're we gonna do, you damn shark?!

191
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,190
We'll break through!

192
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,570
That's just impossible!

193
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,110
This is the worst possible situation!

194
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,540
How can you be so calm?!

195
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,560
First of all, we've gotta protect the ship! Don't let them sink it!

196
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,160
Are you just gonna sit back and take their attacks?

197
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,790
This is a warship too, remember?

198
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,640
Aren't you gonna shoot back, you worthless fools?!

199
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
That was gonna be my suggestion! {here}

200
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,530
Let's shoot back at them, men!

201
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,570
Understood, Captain Buggy!

202
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,380
Sables!

203
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,420
Gomu Gomu no Balloon!

204
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,670
How's that?!

205
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,810
Damn these prisoners...

206
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,140
They must have realized that they're trapped, so why are they still heading towards the Gates of Justice?

207
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,210
The Gates can only be opened by operators inside Impel Down.

208
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,710
There's no other way to open them!

209
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,390
Fire! Send them to the bottom of the sea!

210
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,030
The Gates of Justice are opening!

211
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,290
How can this be?! What's going on?!

212
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,870
Why are the Gates opening?!

213
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,620
It's open!

214
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,990
H-How can this be?

215
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,970
Is it a trap?!

216
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,810
Alright! I don't know why, but the Gates are opening!

217
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,900
What?!

218
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,620
Warden Magellan! Hurry aboard!

219
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,700
No, wait!

220
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,060
Impossible! Why are the Gates opening?!

221
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,210
Are you sure opening the Gates was a good idea...

222
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,630
Warden Magellan?

223
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,240
Yes, this will do. Have my orders ever been wrong? {releasing that rain dude seemed like a winner}

224
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,270
No, it's not that I doubt you...

225
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,420
As soon as their ship has passed through, you are to close the Gate immediately.

226
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,350
Do you understand?

227
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,060
Very well, Sir.

228
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,060
Don't let them escape!

229
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,490
Letting them get away is unforgivable! Fire!

230
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,830
Are these Magellan's orders? What is he thinking?!

231
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,990
I don't understand what he intends to achieve by doing this.

232
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,500
What is Warden Magellan thinking?!

233
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,830
Uh, well, I don't think this was done by the Warden.

234
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,920
He was just standing on the bridge by the main entrance.

235
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,760
Why-? What is happening?!

236
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,610
Control Room! What are you doing?!

237
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,600
Who told you to open the Gates of Justice?!

238
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
W-Warden?!

239
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,820
Oh, my.

240
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,250
Is that really true?

241
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,260
Bon-chan...?

242
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,380
You!

243
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,210
That's right!

244
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,480
It's me!

245
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,350
I tricked you again!

246
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,680
It was a fake?!

247
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,670
Look! The Gates are closing!

248
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,830
They're closing!

249
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,890
If we can get through, the Navy will be trapped on the other side!

250
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,460
He was just with us at the exit!

251
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,540
The only reason we managed to meet Iva-chan and the others,

252
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,690
and escape from there, was because Bon-chan was with us!

253
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,300
And you're telling me we should just go on without him?!

254
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,050
There's no time to waste.

255
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,060
Are we just gonna abandon him?!

256
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,400
We've already abandoned countless allies who fell along the way!

257
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,010
Do you intend to return there and fight Magellan again?!

258
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,920
Then there will be even more sacrifices!

259
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,350
We'd waste even more time, too!

260
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,480
If someone hadn't stayed behind, the Gates would never have opened for us!

261
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm the one who can pull it off best.

262
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,500
I'll open the Gates of Justice!

263
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,840
And what do you intend to do afterwards?

264
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,670
If I told you that, it wouldn't be as cool, would it?

265
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,260
Don't tell Straw-chan anything before we part ways!

266
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,480
Words are not needed for an Okama's parting.

267
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,690
It's still connected.

268
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,070
The Baby Snail Phone has a very short range.

269
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,810
As soon as the Gates close, we'll lose contact with him.

270
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,330
How dare you transform into the Warden?!

271
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,460
Good thing I memorized your face back then!

272
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,570
Open your eyes, Hannyabal!

273
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,590
What happened here?!

274
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,470
W-Warden! Let go of me!

275
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,420
Touch.

276
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,810
How dare you?!

277
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,100
Bon-chan!

278
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,200
Straw-chan?!

279
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,270
Hey! Can you hear me? Bon-chan?!

280
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,510
Why are you doing this again...

281
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,370
just like you did last time?!

282
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,790
Jinbei! Didn't you promise not to tell him before we'd lost contact?!

283
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,330
Weren't we gonna escape together?!

284
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,040
You just keep saving me over and over again!

285
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,480
If you're there, then answer me, Bon-chan!

286
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,350
Is that how it is...?

287
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,280
That Okama-guy...

288
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,600
he stayed behind alone for our sake...?

289
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,100
Bon-chan!

290
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,530
Answer us, Brother Bon!

291
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,770
Why won't you answer?!

292
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,830
Bon-chan!

293
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,610
Mister Two!

294
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,840
Mister Two, you're...

295
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,290
I'm so sorry for everything!

296
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,940
Bon-boy!

297
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,830
Fire!

298
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,860
Don't let them get away!

299
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,490
Blow them to pieces!

300
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,850
Bon-chan!

301
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,040
Bon-chan!

302
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,260
Bon-chan... The Gates are closing.

303
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,710
We're... going.

304
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,900
Thank you!

305
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,940
Brother Bon! Thank you!

306
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,290
Thank you!

307
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,960
Straw-chan!

308
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,960
Bon-chan!

309
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,720
Straw-chan...

310
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,310
You have to save your brother, no matter what!

311
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,890
I'm sure... you can...

312
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,460
save your brother!

313
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,160
Bon-chan!

314
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,120
The Gates are closing!

315
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,950
Sink them!

316
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,750
Long time no see!

317
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,130
I'm perfectly okay!

318
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,590
Quit joking around!

319
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,640
Straw-chan! I've come to save you!

320
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,150
In the name of our friendship!

321
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,140
Hang in there, Straw-chan!

322
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,370
Hang in there!

323
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,210
Words are not needed for an Okama's parting.

324
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,400
Bon-chan!

325
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,430
How can this be?

326
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,090
They got away!

327
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,520
If he hadn't been here, we'd be at the bottom of the ocean by now!

328
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,110
Even in Hell, there is a single blooming flower of friendship.

329
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,450
It rocks back and forth over the waves,

330
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,080
leaving one single petal behind as a memento.

331
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,330
Someday, it will certainly bloom.

332
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,960
Okama Way!

333
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,310
Bon-chan!

334
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,900
Brother Bon!

335
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,790
Bon-boy!

336
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,510
Mister Two!

337
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,810
Do you have any last words?!

338
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,270
Satisfaction!

339
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,290
Let us meet again on the field of Okama.

340
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:42,400
On this day, the number of prisoners who escaped from the world's most feared prison, Impel Down...

341
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,860
was a total of 241.

342
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,390
It was the greatest disgrace Impel Down had suffered in its entire history...

343
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,330
but this incident is still not over.

344
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,830
Time remaining until
Portgas D. Ace's scheduled execution...

345
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,200
4 hours.
