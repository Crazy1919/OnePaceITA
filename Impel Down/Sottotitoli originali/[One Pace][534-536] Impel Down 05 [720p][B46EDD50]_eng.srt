1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,320
This is bad. It's too dangerous here!

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,230
The Inferno Floor sure is hot.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,790
W-Warden! Please, wait a second!

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,950
Please don't fight him just yet!

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,630
Get away from here!

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,740
We'll be affected by the Warden's poison!

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,500
What the hell?

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,340
And I'd almost gotten to where that nice smell was coming from, too!

9
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,730
S-Straw-chan! You can't fight him!

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,720
That's Magellan, the Warden of Impel Down!

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,450
He's got the power of the Doku Doku Fruit!

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,450
{\an8}Doku: Poison

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,300
Run away! This guy's too much for you to handle!

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,550
Doku Doku? So he's a poison man.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,170
That's right.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,900
Straw Hat Luffy...

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,630
The rookie I hear has caused trouble wherever he's gone,

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,980
has opposed both Navy HQ and the World Government, and has a 300 million beli bounty.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,950
I never dreamed that man would break into the legendary, impenetrable prison.

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,130
As the Warden, this is very disgraceful for me.

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,630
I know what you've come here for.

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,000
You want to free your brother, the commander of Whitebeard's Second Division, Portgas D. Ace!

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,640
After capturing you, I'll take my time with you to learn just how you managed to break in here.

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,360
I had hoped I could be of more help to you...

25
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,080
I'd die before telling you that!

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,670
Straw-chan! Magellan's entire body is poisonous!

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,550
You'll be in huge trouble if you so much as touch him!

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,850
Do you really think you stand a chance against a man like him?!

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,910
Get back to the Cauldron of Blood where we were before, and turn right!

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,590
Straw-chan, just give up on the food, and let's make a run towards Level Five!

31
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,350
That won't work!

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,520
The stairway leading to Level Five is guarded by a Head Jailer and three Demon Guards!

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,830
We've already sealed off all escape routes from this floor!

34
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,820
No matter where you try to run...

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,580
you can't escape!

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,420
No! No way!

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,340
Hydra!

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,980
What is that?!

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,050
Is all of that poison?!

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
A huge cluster of poison?!

41
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,770
Wait, Warden Magellan! We're still here!

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,530
What's he doing to his own allies?!

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,660
The Hydra's made of a paralyzing nerve-poison!

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,550
Excruciating pain spreads through your entire body, and eventually kills you!

45
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,100
It hurts...! Hurry, give me the antidote!

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,430
Stay away from me!

47
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't get in the way of my attack, you fools!

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,360
P-Please forgive me!

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm so hungry!

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,640
You've still got your appetite, even now?!

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,670
You're definitely not normal, Straw-chan!

52
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,750
Still, it might be impossible to run away from Magellan!

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,810
Hot!

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,920
Try following me now!

55
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,630
I'm on fire! {oo-oo-oh, I'm on fire~~}

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
Alright! I beat one of its heads!

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,750
But this is as far as you'll go!

58
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,880
Chloroball!

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,200
That was close!

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
Put on your gas masks!

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,190
Keep out of the center!

62
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,000
The Warden is fighting!

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,480
Tear-and-sneezing gas?

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,500
Damn, it's Magellan's poison gas!

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,760
Why is he fighting down here?!

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,750
Who's his opponent?

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,220
Maybe that intruder they were talking about?

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,740
Releasing poison gas in the depths of Hell? This is serious!

69
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,310
Huh? My eyes are itchy, and I can't stop crying!

70
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,960
Whad da hell? I cad't...

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,530
I cad't figdt lige dith!

72
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,230
Whad?!

73
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,680
The dragon stopped!

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,140
Venom Road!

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,050
If I touch him, I'm done for...

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,760
He melted the stone wall!

77
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,930
You're next!

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,990
I must save Ace...!

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,770
In the end, you and your brother Ace...

80
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,260
...will suffer the same fate!

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,900
There'll never be a better chance than now, when Magellan is fighting Straw Hat!

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,660
You're insane, you flashy bastard!

83
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,830
Can't you see how many enemies there are?!

84
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,920
It's not about how many there are! Listen closely!

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,950
They want to prevent Straw Hat from going to the lower levels,

86
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,980
so they've got the Demon Guards guarding the entrance to Level Five!

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,130
This is the easiest escape-route!

88
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,290
If we let this chance go, the net will only close in on us!

89
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,190
This is the best way out!

90
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,430
Straw Hat is bound to lose eventually!

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,580
We've got to get back up to Level Three before that happens!

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,300
You may be right...

93
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,910
And I haven't heard anything about Assistant Warden Hannyabal having any Devil Fruit-powers...

94
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,670
If I blow the rest of 'em away with the Muggy-Ball,

95
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,720
we might be able to handle him!

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,260
That's right.

97
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,940
Get ready!

98
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,680
I've had enough of this infernal floor!

99
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,050
Let's go.

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,050
We've just gotta force our way through!

101
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,130
Indeed!

102
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,910
Hannyabal-sama! It's Buggy the Clown and Mister Three!

103
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,750
They're trying to get back to Level Three!

104
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't let them get away!

105
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,820
Muggy...

106
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,400
Candle...

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,460
Wait!

108
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,160
All troops, pull back!

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,560
Gomu Gomu no...

110
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,080
Stamp!

111
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:11,240
Magellan is capable of silencing the prisoners in the world's greatest prison...

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,410
He's the ruler of Hell...

113
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,850
Let's see some determination, Bon Kurei!

114
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm so sorry!

115
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,320
No matter what I do, I can't win!

116
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,640
I don't stand a chance at winning!

117
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm running away! Sorry!

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,010
I'm sorry, Straw-chan!

119
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,060
I'm sorry!

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,240
You still have no intention of giving up?

121
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,560
I'll break Ace free and get out of here!

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,640
There's no way I'm gonna die before I get to him!

123
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,990
I won't let Ace be executed!

124
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,300
What's with that steam?

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,570
If I'm doomed to lose because you're poisonous and I can't touch you,

126
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,970
then I'd rather touch you and...

127
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,660
give up my arms to beat you!

128
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,190
If you don't want those arms,

129
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,020
then I'll grant your wish and take them!

130
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
Gomu Gomu no...

131
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,220
Jet Bazooka!

132
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,270
Sheesh, what a pain.

133
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,070
If you'd just passed through and caused a ruckus up above, I could've blamed the Warden!

134
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,590
Reporting in from Level Three Archway.

135
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,050
We've suffered some casualties from the escapees' bomb attack.

136
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,950
Yes, we've captured Buggy the Clown and Mister Three.

137
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,080
I told them they could go through, yet they still attacked me!

138
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,670
Freaking morons!

139
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,570
S-So strong! I never expected him to be that strong!

140
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,970
That Hannyabal...

141
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,790
I don't want to be tortured...

142
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,480
If I'm to be tortured, I'd rather bite off my tongue right now...

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,150
I'n godda bide id!

144
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,550
I'll bide id!

145
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,620
I'll weally bide id!

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,390
Is it really impossible to stand up to him?

147
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,950
I don't dream of such reckless things.

148
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,640
If I go over there, the odds of getting killed are 200%...

149
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm running away!

150
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,470
No looking back!

151
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,520
There's no option... But to run!

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,380
To think you could bring me to my knees...

153
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,760
A cornered mouse is a frightful thing.

154
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,350
No matter, the poison covering your arms will be more than enough!

155
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,970
You're suffering, aren't you? How shameful.

156
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,960
Gomu Gomu no...

157
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,100
Twin Jet Pistol!

158
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,330
Poison Pufferfish!

159
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,540
Gomu Gomu no...

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,700
Jet...

161
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,480
Hydra!

162
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,400
Pistol!

163
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,550
Mist...?

164
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,700
Poison Cloud!

165
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,850
Is your eyesight growing blurry?

166
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,060
Are your ears ringing?

167
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,270
Both your hands must be useless by now.

168
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,010
The poison will take everything away from you before long!

169
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,670
Hey, guards!

170
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,080
Tell me the truth!

171
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,880
Something's going above us isn't it?

172
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,550
No. Nothing at all.

173
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,680
Stamp!

174
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,140
That's quite enough, isn't it?

175
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,780
Gear Second!

176
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,420
Hydra!

177
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,950
Give Ace...

178
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,470
back!

179
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,160
This is your punishment.

180
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,710
After exposure to this much poison, no antidote will save you.

181
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,530
You will agonize for 24 hours...

182
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,000
and then you will descend to the real Hell!

183
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,010
Ace...!

184
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,500
Well done, Warden Magellan.

185
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,120
What about the fallen Straw Hat Luffy?

186
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,140
He'll die soon enough.

187
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,090
If you leave him there, he'll just be in our way.

188
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,370
Throw him into the central chamber of Level Five.

189
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,700
Yes, Sir!

190
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,960
W-Warden Magellan!

191
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,300
We've got trouble outside the stairway to Level Three!

192
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,510
What happened?!

193
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,020
We don't have the details yet...

194
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,580
Hey...

195
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,980
Hey!

196
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,530
This guy's done for.

197
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,020
He's either dead, or he's preserved for the future.

198
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,360
No way...

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,910
M-My fingers...

200
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
My fingers won't move...

201
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,090
I can't feel anything in 'em, either...

202
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,870
You've got frostbite, huh? Then you won't last much longer either.

203
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,520
Damn, they're just mocking us.

204
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,300
We can't even eat the bread they feed us.

205
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,450
Huh? Hey, check this out!

206
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,490
A new one got thrown down here.

207
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,580
Hey, what's your name?

208
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,620
How big's your bounty, new guy?

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,740
It's too late for this one.

210
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,550
He's received the poison punishment.

211
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,510
What is the meaning of this?!

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,810
Hannyabal! How could you let all your troops fall as you stood by?!

213
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,480
Wake up, Hannyabal!

214
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,270
What happened here?!

215
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,880
W-Warden! Please let me go!

216
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,910
I-I'm so sorry! I let my guard down!

217
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
I don't want to be tortured!

218
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
{\an8}Goumon: Torture

219
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,170
Asses stink!

220
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,170
{\an8}Koumon: Anus

221
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,060
Damn that Okama bastard!

222
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,040
He abandoned us!

223
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,430
The culprit was an Okama using Kenpo.

224
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,130
I guess you could say he caught us by surprise...

225
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,750
Spare me the excuses!

226
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,600
He's climbed the stairs and escaped to the upper levels, I presume?

227
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,700
The prisoner was a member of Crocodile's organization, Baroque Works.

228
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,710
A man who calls himself Mister Two...

229
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh, I mean, an Okama.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,710
What difference does it make?

231
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,770
He was imprisoned on Level Three.

232
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,740
It should only be a matter of time before they catch him.

233
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,550
What about the commotion on Level Two?

234
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,200
It seems to have finally calmed down.

235
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,090
Send all the soldiers gathered here up to Level Three!

236
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,630
Have Sadi-chan take command and release the Demon Guards!

237
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,130
They'll take care of the rest.

238
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,430
Very well. What about these two prisoners?

239
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,930
Do whatever you want.

240
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,470
Just hurry and clean up this mess. Get Impel Down back to normal!

241
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,140
I will now seclude myself again.

242
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
Diarrhea, huh?

243
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,870
Hey! You guys, get up, and look for the last escapee!

244
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,280
Yes, sir. Right away!

245
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,530
Uh... Umm... What do we do with these two?

246
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,020
Oh, I've got something I wanna ask them.

247
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,580
Send them to the interrogation room.

248
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,960
I'll handle them myself.

249
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,410
Understood.

250
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,880
We'll leave you alone then, Assistant Warden.

251
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,840
You saved us!

252
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,680
W-We managed to avoid torture!

253
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,020
Very well, what do we do now?

254
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,320
Ain't it obvious?

255
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,440
We've got to hurry and...

256
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,820
save Straw-chan before it's too late!

257
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,140
S-Save him?

258
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,720
Didn't you hear the soldiers? He was poisoned by Magellan and thrown down to Level Five!

259
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,240
There's no hope for Straw Hat now!

260
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,430
We'd just die like dogs!

261
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,170
I don't care if I die like a dog, an Okama or whatever!

262
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:29,390
The second I turned my back on Straw-chan and Magellan, I forfeited my own life!

263
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,470
As I ran away, I made a pledge; "Rather than dying in vain here and now, I'll run away,

264
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:44,660
and as long as you survive, I'll come back and save you even if it kills me!"

265
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,130
I don't mind you making a pledge or whatever,

266
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:54,420
but why would you go and risk your life again now that you've finally escaped?

267
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,400
Because he's my friend!

268
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,420
That's all the reason I need!

269
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,480
Your... friend?

270
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,730
If we're gonna save Straw-chan, we've gotta do something about the poison first!

271
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,430
That's it! We need an antidote!

272
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,720
It won't be easy to get something so valuable.

273
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,230
And it's probably too late already...

274
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,790
Shut up!

275
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,360
This is something I have to do!

276
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,070
Wait for me! Please don't die, Straw-chan!

277
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,550
What?!

278
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,460
Uh, I mean... What do you mean, you can't make an antidote?

279
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:40,520
No one who's fought Warden Magellan and been exposed to his multi-layered poison has survived.

280
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:47,340
We might be able to counteract one of them, but there's no way to cure someone of all of his poisons!

281
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,510
And you dare to call yourselves medical specialists?!

282
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,020
Are you kidding me?!

283
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,830
That is, don't try to fool me!

284
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,070
Just do something!

285
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,280
It's been decided that we're to hand
Straw Hat Luffy over to the Navy alive!

286
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,060
But injecting him with random antidotes might just hasten his death.

287
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,570
I'm afraid he's beyond saving...

288
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,290
That's why I said we couldn't save Straw Hat!

289
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,120
There's no antidote for him.

290
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,990
We're all out of options!

291
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,060
It'd take a miracle to go up against that guy and live to tell the tale.

292
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,750
A miracle?

293
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,000
That's it! Just the person we need is here in Impel Down!

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,350
The Okama Queen, Iva-san!

295
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,700
He's saved people whom doctors deemed incurable...

296
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,200
and rescued all the inhabitants of a country on the verge of death!

297
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,020
The legendary, ultimate Okama star, Iva-san!

298
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,420
We've got to go and find him quickly!

299
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,410
Iva-san... Who's that?

300
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,500
Staff Stairway

301
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,540
You're going to Level Five?

302
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,190
That's right.

303
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,170
I've sentenced these two to freeze down there.

304
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,590
Keep moving!

305
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,300
In any case, we've got no choice but to go!

306
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,540
Wait for me, Straw-chan!

307
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,370
But this list of prisoners bothers me...

308
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,630
What's going on?

309
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,090
Emporio Ivankov...

310
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,980
The name of the great Okama Queen, Iva-san, has been crossed out.

311
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,740
Could he have been released already?

312
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
Or was he sentenced to death?

313
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,850
Was this prisoner released?

314
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,560
Huh? Oh, Ivankov...

315
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,850
A few years ago, he was, you know...

316
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,440
What are you talking about?

317
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,730
Have you forgotten, Assistant Warden?

318
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,450
Oh, right. That. That thing.

319
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,820
I take it you know what he means? Let's hear it.

320
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,240
With the prisoners here...?

321
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,740
Just say it!

322
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,370
The disappearances that sometimes happen within Impel Down.

323
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,610
It's nothing like an escape.

324
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,970
Prisoners who can't even move suddenly vanish, without leaving a single trace.

325
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,340
The Demon's Tug.

326
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,300
Everyone is afraid of these unnatural disappearances,

327
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,980
and because some think they might've been dragged into the world of demons,

328
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,110
it has earned the name Demon's Tug.

329
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,000
People just...

330
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Vanish?

331
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,360
I wish I hadn't heard that story.

332
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,330
You can say that again.

333
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,610
It's so cold!

334
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,260
And they haven't even opened the doors yet!

335
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,660
Even through all these clothes we're wearing!

336
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,050
We're here.

337
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,760
Be careful of the cold and the Army Wolves.

338
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,350
Now, as usual, I'll take your things.

339
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,250
Huh? What things?

340
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,840
Your weapons and your coat.

341
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,380
What?

342
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,050
Man, we really can't compare to you.

343
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,260
You keep saying "I'm gonna show the prisoners how tough an Assistant Warden I am",

344
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,090
so you go through the Frozen Hell half-naked and unarmed!

345
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,700
All of us guards really admire you!

346
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,290
Wha-?!

347
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,660
And of course, we can't have the prisoners walking around in warm clothes...

348
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
They took his coat-

349
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,660
What?!

350
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,100
Take care, now!

351
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,110
Keep in mind, Snail Phones don't work out in that cold!

352
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,300
Be careful!

353
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,380
What?!

354
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,950
I... can't control my hands properly in this cold...

355
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,710
It's cold! It's so cold, it hurts!

356
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,960
J-Just a little more...!

357
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,260
I got them off!

358
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,290
You did it!

359
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,290
1, 2, 3, 4...

360
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,860
Hey, you d-don't think those're the Army Wolves, do you?

361
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,940
Do you k-know why these things aren't up on the Accursed Beasts Floor?

362
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,600
No, why?

363
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,750
I k-k-k-know...

364
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,440
It's b-b-because if they were let loose on Level Two, they'd eat the Basilisk, the Sphinx and all the other beasts!

365
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,750
They're that strong?!

366
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,520
So they're a whole new level of savagery?!

367
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,950
First they take our coats and force us to suffer the cold, and now we've gotta face the Army Wolves?!

368
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,960
Now I'm quivering even more than before...

369
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,950
Then let's get ready to fight 'em off!

370
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,500
We're gonna save Straw-chan!

371
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,260
I don't wanna get eaten, dammit!

372
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,810
You're running away already?!

373
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,300
We've got one unusual fellow here...

374
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,860
They need us to get his time of death or something?

375
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,790
It hurts...

376
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,500
I wanna go save Ace!

377
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,660
It is as futile as a single ant jumping into a storm. {need to check this! I thought I used hurricane here. I am almost certain, unless it was changed post-edit. I will check within a day. skip this line, please. -kae}

378
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,790
You might get cast aside without even a chance of doing anything.

379
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,170
Quit wasting your breath.

380
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,480
After being poisoned that badly, there's no way you'll survive.

381
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,900
Looks like you can't see. Can you even hear me?

382
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,510
Just accept your death.

383
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,700
No way! I won't die!

384
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,570
I... refuse to die...

385
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,330
Until I've saved Ace...!

386
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,690
You wanna save someone else?

387
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,090
You can't even save yourself, ya know.

388
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,360
They got a friend of yours locked up in here or somethin'?

389
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,440
Ridiculous. In prison, you only look out for yourself.

390
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,080
There's nobody gonna save ya...

391
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
Nobody'll ever come to save ya...

392
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,430
We're all on our own here.

393
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,400
Get thrown into the sea of fire, and you gotta step on other prisoners to get back up.

394
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,680
If you meet the beasts, you grab whoever's nearby and use them as bait to protect yourself.

395
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,990
Try to help someone else, and you'll end up dead yourself!

396
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,930
So stop raving about wanting to rescue anyone!

397
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,630
You're makin' me sick!

398
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,120
Hey look, someone's coming.

399
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,470
Doesn't look like surveillance or staff...

400
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,550
What's with that guy?

401
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,820
He's naked...

402
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,520
Straw-chan... I'm here to save you...!

403
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,320
In the name of our friendship...!

404
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,570
What's with this guy?

405
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,840
He's covered in blood.

406
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,740
Back there, I...

407
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,030
I'm so sorry I ran away!

408
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,470
How do you know this guy?

409
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I'm his friend!

410
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,340
Straw-chan, I won't let you die!

411
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,750
He left the keys...

412
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,910
Breaking out, huh? I'd never even considered it...

413
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,980
I have to hurry and find Iva-san!

414
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,040
Iva-san?

415
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,200
How should I know where that damn Okama went?

416
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,210
Who are you, anyway?

417
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,140
Emporio Ivankov...

418
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,690
Yeah, he was here a while back.

419
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,360
Isn't he dead now?

420
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
What's with that look?

421
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,720
What's the point of searching for someone who's not here?

422
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,530
Nevermind that, how'd you get out of the cage?

423
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,990
Let me out too, okay?

424
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,790
I'm looking for someone named Iva-san.

425
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,880
Hello, you listening?

426
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,930
Hey, can you hear me?!

427
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,530
It's no use.

428
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,220
The guys in that cell have all frozen to death.

429
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,050
Uh...

430
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,510
I heard you.

431
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,000
You want to know about that damn Okama, Ivankov, right?

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,990
Do you know something?

433
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,350
Look over there.

434
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,480
You can see the forest, right?

435
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,190
Yeah...

436
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,690
There's a jailer's room over there that no one uses anymore.

437
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,890
I've seen a weird guy coming out of there a few times.

438
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,250
Really?

439
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,660
If you think I'm lying, go see for yourself.

440
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,400
Thanks!

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,870
Don't mention it.

442
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,440
Hey, isn't the wolves' den out in that forest?

443
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,410
Oh, really?

444
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,990
A gate to the underworld?

445
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,160
The Demon's Tug? What the hell is that supposed to mean?!

446
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,920
I won't accept such a stupid reason for Iva-san's disappearance!

447
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,660
I've never met him, but people say he's performed countless miracles.

448
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,700
And I believe he's still working miracles here!

449
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,420
Iva-san is the God of the Okama world!

450
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,260
I beg of you! Save Straw-chan's life!

451
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,630
If there's no antidote to this poison,

452
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,840
then you're the only one who can save him!

453
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,930
I can only have faith and keep searching!

454
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,380
Oh, crap!

455
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,830
Straw-chan?!

456
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,300
What are you...

457
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,690
doing...

458
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,550
to Bon-chan...?!

459
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,350
Get away...

460
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,220
from Bon-chan!

461
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,250
S-Straw-chan!

462
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,370
What...

463
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,380
was...

464
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,950
that...?

465
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,310
Time left until Ace's execution...

466
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,940
26 hours.
