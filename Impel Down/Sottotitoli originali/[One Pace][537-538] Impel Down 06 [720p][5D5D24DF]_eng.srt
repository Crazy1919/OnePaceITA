00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,900
Damn...

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,500
Where did you go?!

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,120
It's so hot in here!

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,860
It's like we're in Hell!

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,200
Wha-?  Sh-?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,510
She's just my type! {Not sure.}

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,630
Healthy, young and a flawless beauty!

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,990
But wait... What?

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,130
What happened to that Okama who beat up all the guards?

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,940
Huh?  What are you...

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,960
That doesn't matter, does it, big guy?

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,020
Come over here for a sec...

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,970
Huh?

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm so sweaty, my shirt's stuck to my skin...

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,680
Could you help me take this off?

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,850
Come on...

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,420
Well now, d'you mind opening the door for me?

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,190
Yes, of course!

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,440
There we go!

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,830
Okay then, let me give you a hand with that...

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,070
You got a change of clothes with you?

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,190
Fooled you!

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,590
Unforgivable...

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,910
What that Okama did was unforgivable!

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,630
I'd be happy to blame the Warden for this, but I can't stand being outwitted!

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,880
Besides, I wanna be Warden...

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,880
I used too much poison...

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,560
My stomach is...! {EW!!!}

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,880
Yea, we've finally stopped all the commotion.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,700
We've put all the prisoners back in their cages, and we've retrieved the stolen keys, but...

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,020
there are quite a few missing.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
This is really troublesome.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,850
How could you possibly...

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,790
not find him?!

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,320
Hurry and bring him to me, alive!

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
The Okama-prisoner is, without a doubt...

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,670
on this floor!

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,300
Yes, ma'am!

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,260
And then, as more time passes by,
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei finds himself...

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
Oh, so you're finally awake, bro!

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
You've been sleeping for quite a while, huh?  Want a drink?

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,950
Cheers for the Newkama!

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,490
Cheers!

47
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,470
We saw all of it on the monitors.

48
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,000
That uprising of yours was really something to see!

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,170
What is this place?

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,080
Let me take you to your seat.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,460
What floor did you come from?

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,550
We've got plenty of food here!

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,350
You must be starving.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,510
What is this place?  Where's Straw-chan?!

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,670
Do you think you've escaped to the outside world?

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,200
Don't worry.

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
We're still in Impel Down.

58
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,880
Like hell we are!

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,650
Nobody's wearing a prison jumpsuit.

60
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,970
Everyone's eating delicious food and drinking booze...

61
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,490
Is this some sort of paradise?!

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,450
That's right!  I...

63
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,800
I was chased by the wolves, and saved by Straw-chan's mysterious power,

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
and then I lost consciousness.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,340
So, is this a dream?

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,880
No, wait!  I must have frozen to death!

67
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Is this the afterlife?

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,310
Oh, you're awake?

69
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,530
You sure slept for a long time.

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,720
It must have been at least 10 hours.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,140
10 hours?!

72
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,400
What're you talking about?

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,150
Who are you?!

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
My name is Inazuma.

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
Don't be so rude.

76
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,490
I was the one who carried the two of you here when you were on the verge of freezing to death.

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,360
The two of us, you said...

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,320
Does that mean Straw-chan is here too?

79
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,070
Where is he?  Is he safe?!

80
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,720
Are you guys prison staff?

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,500
Where... Where is this place??

82
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,960
Now, calm down.

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,870
That person will tell you everything you need to know.

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,580
"That person"...?

85
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,200
The lights are down!

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,250
The show's starting!

87
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,350
Let us go up to the front.

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,970
Did vyou sleep well, Candy-boy?

89
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,730
Or rather, Mr. 2 Bon-boy?

90
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,480
What?  How do you know my name?

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Vi'm impressed that vyou made it here.

92
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,860
This is...

93
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,740
Good going!  You're super sexy!

94
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,830
This is...

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,620
A place that vyou'll reach by taking...

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,750
A path that shouldn't exist through the sewers of Impel Down.

97
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,840
A prisoners' paradise!

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,070
There's all sorts of entertainment down here!

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,970
Liquor...

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,450
Weapons...

101
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,200
Games...

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,110
And above all else, FREEDOM!

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,990
YEAH!  THAT'S RIGHT!  WE'RE ALL FREE!

104
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,120
That's right.

105
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,780
The guards were making a fuss today.

106
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,480
Saying "The prisoners have been dragged into the underworld", vyou know?

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,540
But that's too bad!  Vwe're all down here!

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,390
Great going!

109
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,170
Yay!

110
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,100
This ain't the underworld...

111
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,400
It's more like the Okama-world!

112
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,990
The hidden society known to no one!

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,070
Vi welcome you...

114
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,080
...to Impel Down Level 5.5!
The secret hideout of the prisoners...

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,240
NEWKAMA LAND!

116
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,050
What's with this army of perverts?

117
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,880
Iva-sama!

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,060
Iva-san?!

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,740
The tension in here is a bit too much...

120
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,290
Vi'm gonna... Collapse...

121
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,920
Iva-sama, are you alright?

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,790
Vi'm gonna... Vi'm gonna...

123
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,610
Vi'm gonna be JUST FINE!

124
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,420
You were just kidding?!

125
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,780
You got me there!

126
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,800
Are you really Iva-san?

127
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,500
Ah, so vyou know who Vi am?

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,520
Hey!  Why are you calling him "Iva-san" so casually!?

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,470
Yea!  It's Iva-sama, King of Newkama!

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,780
Iva-sama!  Iva-sama!

131
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,740
Be silent, Candies!

132
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,070
It's just a name.  No need to get so worked up over it.

133
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,750
How vyou address vme is of no concern.

134
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,910
People can talk to me however they want. They can even call me "Poo"!

135
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,120
But they better not!

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,350
We can't call you poo?!

137
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,080
You got me there!

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,980
T-This person is the "Miracle-worker"?

139
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,260
The one I've always looked up to?!

140
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,890
Emporio Ivankov!

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,520
I hear you're the Queen of the Drag Queendom!

142
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,720
My dad was a king fifteen years ago,

143
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,760
until he set foot in Kamabakka...

144
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,830
and came back as an okama!

145
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,670
Because the king was an Okama, our pride and royalty were lost!

146
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,210
And I turned from a prince into a pirate!

147
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,490
I never expected to get my revenge in here!

148
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,720
You're gonna pay for ruining my life!

149
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,860
S-S-Stop it, please!

150
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,420
What a dangerous weapon!

151
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,070
It's dangerous!  Vi'm telling you, it's too dangerous!

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,280
Vi'll die!  Vi'll die!

153
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,990
If vyou hit me, Vi... Vi...

154
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,990
Won't die!

155
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,650
You won't die?

156
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,810
You got me that time!

157
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,940
Death Wink!

158
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,500
There it is!  Iva-sama's simple flutter of an eye, the Death Wink!

159
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,290
H-He repelled the cannonball with just a wink?!

160
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,520
Emporio Female Hormone!

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,760
What did you...?!

162
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,090
You... It can't be...?!

163
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,340
So vyour father wanted to become a woman.

164
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,590
What's wrong with that?

165
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,470
S-S-Stop it!

166
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,680
It-t-t...  It's shrinking! {this is how I want this stutter -kae}

167
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,320
Two mothers and one daughter.

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
Doesn't that sound lovely?

169
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,150
Vi hope vyou'll get along.

170
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,150
Nooo!  No, stop it!

171
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,120
Stop it!

172
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,390
A man, a woman...

173
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,130
or an Okama...

174
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,680
Vyou should just be what vyou want to be, right?!

175
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,990
Gender doesn't matter here!

176
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:08,820
Vi, no, vwe are a new race, who do not care about such petty things!

177
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,000
The Newkama!

178
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,260
This is the garden of freedom, Newkama Land!

179
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,480
Iva-sama!

180
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,560
He turned a man into a woman!

181
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,160
He really is a miracle-worker!

182
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,780
Welcome, to vmy Newkama Land!

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,210
I-It's too embarassing!

184
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,310
Overwhelmed with shame...

185
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,130
Vi suppose vyou still have a long way to go before becoming a Newkama, then.

186
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,760
Miracle-worker, Emporio Ivankov!

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,040
It's an honor to meet you!

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,770
I'm so glad to meet you!  Really!

189
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,920
Forgive my insolence, but I have a favor to ask!

190
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,270
A favor?

191
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,760
My friend was poisoned by Magellan, and I want you to save his life!

192
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,120
He's long past being curable, and his death is quickly approaching!

193
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,730
I'll do anything for you if you'll just save him!

194
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,870
Are vyou talking about Straw-Hat-boy?

195
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,620
Bon-Boy?

196
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,320
Do vyou know why Vi treated vyour injuries?

197
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,630
Now that you mention it...

198
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,810
Vwe're prisoners.

199
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,930
Vwe're not so kind as to heal every wounded person we come across.

200
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,360
It's because that Straw-Hat-boy vyou mentioned begged that vyour life be spared.

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,110
Straw-chan did?!

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,620
Bon-chan...

203
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,770
tried to save me...

204
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,970
He was attacked by the wolves!

205
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,170
Please... Help him...!

206
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,200
Please...!

207
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,000
He's... my friend...!

208
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,270
Most people'd never say that sort of thing so close to death themselves.

209
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,260
Seems the flower of friendship can bloom even here, in the prison.

210
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,610
If Vi had ignored that request, Vi'd be no better than a demon.

211
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,980
Straw-chan!

212
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,570
Straw-Hat-boy's treatment has been going for ten hours now.

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,620
Really?!

214
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,090
It's an excruciating process, though.

215
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,100
What's going on in there?!

216
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,410
You call this treatment?!

217
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:14,510
Vhe's been locked inside the cave for the past ten hours, screaming all the while.

218
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,140
It'll take another two days before vhis treatment ends.

219
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,890
What?!

220
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,980
Ten years of vyour life.

221
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:36,040
Vi will be cutting ten years off vyour lifespan, Straw Hat-boy.

222
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,330
Okay...

223
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,700
However, even using those ten years, Vi cannot guarantee that vyou'll survive.

224
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:53,320
It will only increase vyour odds from zero to two or three percent.

225
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Whether or not it's possible for vyou to survive...

226
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,640
depends entirely on vyour own will to live.

227
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,150
If vyou die, the poison wins.

228
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,300
If vyou escape with vyour life, you win!

229
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,950
Have a nice journey to the brink of death!

230
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,560
Emporio Healing Hormone!

231
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,890
T-Ten hours?!

232
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,450
You've been screaming out in pain like this, for the past ten hours, Straw-chan?!

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,600
Spirit and hormones.

234
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,250
These make up a body's vital forces.

235
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,420
Vi have pushed the power of Straw-Hat boy's immune system beyond the normal limit,

236
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,870
to rebuild his body into one able to withstand the poison.

237
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,370
His insides are currently breaking down and rebuilding themselves rapidly, over and over again.

238
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,650
If his pained screaming stops, it will mean the treatment has claimed his life.

239
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,540
If vyou're worried, vyou can go have a look at him.

240
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,000
W-Where is it... Where?

241
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,420
Straw-ch-?

242
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,850
H-He's gonna die!

243
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,910
His body is all battered...

244
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,730
It's gon' break him... And tear him...

245
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,190
He's al'eady dead!  I'th horri'le!

246
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,140
Help him!  Please, save Straw-chan!

247
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,540
Remove the chains and stop his bleeding!

248
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,020
Please do something... Anything...!

249
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm begging you!

250
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,920
Silence!

251
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,470
Vi'm already trying to save him!

252
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,410
Don't vyou underestimate life!

253
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,430
Do vyou understand what it means to fight against death when already destined to die?!

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,160
Vi am no God or Buddha.

255
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,740
A miracle-worker?

256
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,320
Vyou can call vme whatever vyou want, but...

257
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,910
Vi've never saved anyone foolish enough to depend on someone else for everything.

258
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,780
Even those countries on the verge of destruction, lacking the strength to survive...

259
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,710
All Vi did was ask if they had the will to live.

260
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Miracles only occur for those with the determination to never stop trying!

261
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,960
Never underestimate the power of miracles!

262
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,860
So in short, Vi ate the Hormone Fruit.  Vi'm a hormone-altering man.

263
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,990
Gender, body temperature, pigmentation, growth, and excitement.

264
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,740
Vi'm an engineer of the human body who can alter people from the inside.

265
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,240
Vyou have the scent of a Newkama, but...

266
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,040
The Candies here have overcome the barriers of gender.

267
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,790
The men may have been women,

268
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,710
...or for all vyou know, the women were once men.

269
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,220
It's a miracle.

270
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,930
Indeed, an unbelievable miracle!

271
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,260
I get it!

272
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,520
You used those hormones earlier to turn that man into a woman.

273
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,760
But, look at this place.

274
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,680
I just can't believe it's a prison!

275
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,150
This has got to be a dream!

276
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,820
It's no dream!  It's the land of dreams!

277
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,740
All the Candies here were lost prisoners.

278
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,830
They all came here by pure luck.

279
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,240
There are entrances to Newkama Land on every floor.

280
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,790
In the forest of blood-stained needles...

281
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,960
in the den of the beasts...

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,420
in the scorching hellfire...

283
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,540
and among the piles of corpses.

284
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,590
Vwe can get all vwe need by taking those routes.

285
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,020
The jailers haven't noticed a thing.

286
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,460
After all, who'd think such a paradise could be hidden in Hell?

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,810
All information from the outside world is available to vus.

288
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:10,030
Vwe have a Snail Monitor down here, just like the ones in the monitor rooms.

289
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,030
Vwe know everything that goes on in the prison that way.

290
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,870
And vwe snatch newspapers from the trash cans, so vwe're all up to date on the outside world.

291
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,760
Vyour little uproar led by Straw-Hat-boy, the first intruder in this prison's history,

292
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,200
was a lot of fun to watch.

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
It was really fascinating.

294
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,090
Where are we, anyway?

295
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,970
How can this huge space even exist?

296
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,460
It wasn't here at first.

297
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,890
Long ago, there was a prisoner who'd eaten a burrowing Devil Fruit.

298
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,310
Vi hear that this Candy was the first to start working on this prisoners' paradise.

299
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,310
This place is like an anthill carved into an enormous rock.

300
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,490
If vyou want to know which floor it is, it's right between Level 5 and 6.

301
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,950
Hey, wait a second!  Level 6?!

302
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,000
That floor exists?!

303
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Yeah, though most people don't know it,

304
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,100
it does exist.

305
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,470
It's where the truly dangerous prisoners are kept.

306
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,640
Those who are sentenced to life or condemned to death.

307
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,390
Level 6, Eternal Hell.

308
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,230
The brutality of these prisoners forces the government to conceal its very existence.

309
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,860
Then again, they hide anything that's inconvenient for them.

310
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,740
For instance, vyou guys tore through the prison all the way down to Level 4,

311
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,790
but if vyou had come a bit sooner, Vi don't think vyou'd have made it as far.

312
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,120
Because there used to be another great power in this prison.

313
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,260
The Head Jailer of Impel Down, Shiryuu of the Rain.

314
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,550
His power equaled that of Warden Magellan,

315
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,480
and considering Magellan's relative lack of experience, Shiryuu may have been even more deadly.

316
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,650
M-More deadly than Magellan!?

317
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,420
Impel Down prided itself in being
impenetrable because of those two.

318
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,070
The Head Jailer...

319
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,460
Shiryuu of the Rain?!

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,750
Shiryuu!  What are you doing?!

321
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,340
Whaddaya mean "What"?

322
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,280
The prisoners aren't here for your entertainment, Shiryuu!

323
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,930
Who's going to complain if I clean up
a little human trash?

324
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,390
I can't overlook your behavior any longer.

325
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,730
If word of your actions were to leak outside,

326
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,860
it would stain Impel Down's reputation!

327
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,950
By my authority as Warden, I hereby place you under arrest!

328
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,290
He slaughtered so many prisoners on mere whim...

329
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,680
that he was deemed a threat and is now restrained on Level 6.

330
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,350
I've never heard anything about that!

331
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,850
Even if it happened before I was put in here...

332
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,230
The most fearsome woman in the history of piracy, Katarina Devon,

333
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,730
the Giant Battleship, San Juan Wolf,

334
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,040
and the Great Drinker, Basco Shot...

335
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,820
All of them, pirates whose names send shivers down the spine...

336
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,060
But their most brutal crimes never made it into the newspapers.

337
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,670
Those are the kind of legendary pirates who are imprisoned on Level 6!

338
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,900
Vyour old boss is there too.

339
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,130
He was quite insane himself.

340
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,970
Huh?  Zero-chan?  Crocodile?!

341
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,970
Straw-Hat-boy and vyour organization were enemies in Alabasta, weren't vyou?

342
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,680
Quite a curious relationship you have.

343
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,650
Allegiances mean nothing in a friendship!

344
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,220
That's true.

345
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,180
And there's also Jinbei, Knight of the Sea and one of the Seven Warlords.

346
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,450
And then there's the one that Straw-Hat-boy is trying to save, right?

347
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,170
Captain of the Whitebeard Pirates' Second Division, Portgas D. Ace.

348
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,460
Vi heard through the prison communications that they're apparently brothers.

349
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,680
Yeah.  Straw-chan came all the way down here to rescue that guy.

350
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,140
Just getting to the prison and breaking in was practically an act of God.

351
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,850
But now, he's gonna have to give up on all that.

352
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,060
His own life must come first, after all.

353
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,420
It's past midnight now,

354
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,460
so Ace-boy will be executed today, at 3 in the afternoon.

355
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,240
Vi assume he'll be taken to Navy HQ in the morning...

356
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,920
In another, let's see,

357
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,470
7 or 8 hours, Ace-boy will be taken out of Impel Down.

358
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,190
Straw-Hat-boy's treatment will still take another two days.

359
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,070
Even if he manages to survive, it'll take vhim another three days of sleep to recover his strength.

360
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,760
By the time he wakes up, it'll all be over.

361
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,220
More importantly, will Straw-chan even be able to survive two days in his state?!

362
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,370
They normally don't survive.  It's a miracle if they do, didn't Vi tell vyou?

363
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,380
Vyou need to rest, too.

364
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,550
Get something to eat and go to sleep.

365
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,450
Vi'll take vyou to a quiet room.

366
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,870
I'll be outside Straw-chan's room!

367
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,350
Hey, drop it!  He's...

368
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,270
I don't think he's got much of a chance.

369
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,440
What can you possibly do?

370
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,320
I wonder what he's doing...

371
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,480
There's nothing to do but wait...

372
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,420
HANG IN THERE!

373
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,670
HANG IN THERE, STRAW-CHAN!

374
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,970
HANG IN THERE!

375
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,220
H-HANG IN THERE!

376
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,390
HANG IN THERE!

377
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,140
He's been doing that this whole time?

378
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,850
Hang in there!

379
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,850
What an idiot. That won't help at all.

380
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,770
Why aren't you able to find...

381
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,860
one single Okama?!

382
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,190
Search the place one more time!

383
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,210
H-Hang in there!

384
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,960
Hang in there!

385
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,660
Hang in there, Straw-chan!

386
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,810
Straw-chan!  Live!

387
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:24,440
Hang in there!

388
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,310
Hang in there!

389
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:47,960
Hang in there, Straw-chan!

390
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,460
Warden!

391
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,880
We just received a message from the Level 5 kitchen staff!

392
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,850
Straw Hat Luffy...

393
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,730
...has disappeared!

394
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,510
What?!

395
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,620
A-Assistant Warden Hannyabal!

396
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,410
What are you doing here?!

397
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,720
Hang in there!

398
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,640
Hang in there, Straw-chan!

399
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,050
Ace-san...

400
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,760
I don't know anything about that woman, but...

401
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,650
Wouldn't it be better to just assume she was lying?

402
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,910
You're saying she came all the way down here just to lie to me?!

403
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,960
No, sorry...

404
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,670
But you know, Jinbei...

405
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,840
That's just the kind of brother he is...

406
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,430
He just keeps doing these reckless things!

407
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,130
He's been making me worry about him ever since we were kids, that idiot!

408
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,620
It's... It's blood!

409
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,420
His voice...

410
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,960
There's no way he'd stop screaming during his treatment.

411
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,510
If he falls silent before the end...

412
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,300
That's a shame!

413
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,640
However, vyou fought well for 20 hours.

414
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,770
Straw-chan!

415
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:07,330
Food!

416
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,520
S-Straw-chan!

417
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,580
Straw-Hat-boy!

418
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,750
N-No way!

419
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,550
What's going on?!

420
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,850
It hasn't even been a day yet!

421
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,640
Warden.  Warden Magellan!

422
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,260
Good morning.

423
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,890
I've got diarrhea.

424
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,100
Then hurry up.

425
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,100
It's time for Portgas D. Ace to be taken to his execution.

426
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,360
Bring the food!  Quickly!

427
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,400
No matter if it's raw, just get as much as possible!

428
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,240
Hurry!  Place it by the door!

429
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,660
Amazing... He's sucking it in like an antlion pit!

430
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,410
How long is he gonna keep eating?

431
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,000
He's been going like this for 30 minutes!

432
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,260
He's eaten several days of Kama Land's food supply...

433
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,680
That's quite the impressive vitality!

434
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,390
He's coming out!

435
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,360
What is that creature?

436
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,630
That thing's not human!

437
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,950
I'M...

438
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,520
ALL BETTER!!!
