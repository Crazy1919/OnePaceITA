1
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,380
HE ABSORBED ALL THAT ENERGY?!

2
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,120
You're unbelievable!

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,480
You ain't human!

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,220
There's no way you could've survived Magellan's poisons!

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,830
He beat the poisoning in only 20 hours!

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,310
It's an unbelievable miracle!

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,080
A miracle...

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,440
This is more than a miracle!

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,070
Hooray!

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,040
Thank God...

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,890
Bon-chan!

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,250
You're alright after all.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,460
Stupid! Quit joking around!

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm the one who ought to be saying...

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,510
Bon-chan! Hey!

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,930
You okay? Hang in there!

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,340
What's wrong? Hey!

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,060
He's just overexerted himself.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,350
His injuries have nothing to do with it.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,050
Oh, Iva-chan...

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,980
Iva-chan!

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,730
We survived! Thanks a lot for everything you've done for us.

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,820
It's this Mister Two Bon-boy vyou should be thanking.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,470
Vi just used vmy abilities and lent vyou some strength.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,290
But he...

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,970
He kept on shouting for hours on end...

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,790
Until his throat was dry and he was coughing up blood...

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,680
He stayed here all along, sharing vyour pain...

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,690
Constantly shouting for vyou to hang in there and live on!

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,940
Vi'm pretty sure he made at least some difference in vyour struggle to survive.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,080
I see...

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,320
What's with that guy?

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,290
He's naked...

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,400
Straw-chan... I'm here to save you...!

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,360
In the name of our friendship...!

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,910
Bon-chan, thanks a lot.

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm in your debt!

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,340
Here's your hat and some clothes.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,730
You've survived, but that's all.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,700
You won't make a full recovery
until you've rested a few days.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,510
I don't have time for that!

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,990
I've wasted too much time already!

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,060
Sorry, but can you guys take care of Bon-chan?

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,860
I'll come back for him later.

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,940
Hey, hey!

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,290
See? You're completely worn out.

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,010
The paper is still pointing down.

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,360
Ace is down there...

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,620
Come to think of it, where are we?

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,690
What's that?

51
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,020
Isn't that a Vivre Card?

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,260
This is the space between Levels Five and Six.

53
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,150
Now that vyou've recovered,

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,030
Vi suppose vyou don't care about anything other than saving vyour brother, right?

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,360
Well, it's none of vmy business what vyou do with vyour life...

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,430
Iva-chan, aren't you gonna escape?

57
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,830
I mean, Bon-chan came down here hoping to save your ass, y'know?

58
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,630
His ass?!

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,450
Mind telling me where Ace is while you're escaping?

60
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,280
What are vyou saying?

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,850
Bon-boy came here to save vme?

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,490
So that's how it is, huh?

63
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,520
Well isn't that cute...

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,820
It's the thought that counts, Vi guess...

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,690
But it's not the time for vme to break out just yet!

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,950
Vi understand the balance of power in the world.

67
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,120
The Navy and the Whitebeard Pirates are both trying to shift the world in their favor...

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,210
But "that man" has yet to make his move.

69
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,130
The man who oversees all the revolutionaries in the world...

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,250
Vmy companion...

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,730
The revolutionary, Dragon!

72
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,940
Oh, you mean my dad?

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,910
That's right.

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,570
As soon as vyour dad rallies his troops and makes his move...

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,900
Vi shall once again return to the surface and throw vmyself into the flow of the world.

76
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,070
Even if Vi were to try and escape right now,

77
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,650
Vi would merely end up being hunted down.

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
DID HE SAY "DAD"?!

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,280
Dragon is...

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,460
vyour dad?!

81
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
V-V-Vyou've got to be kidding vme!

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,590
Vyou're Dragon's son?!

83
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,530
He has a son?!

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Ah...

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,190
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone...

86
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,650
Well, whatever. Gramps told me...

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,960
Your father's name is...

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,110
Monkey D. Dragon.

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,280
He's a revolutionary.{Garp is clearly only capable of discussing matters of lineage with his finger up his nose.}

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,790
I don't really know him myself...

91
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,580
To be honest, I don't even know what he looks like.

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,670
If he doesn't know, that just makes it all the more convincing!

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,050
He doesn't look like a liar, and he's made a huge impact on the pirate world!

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,510
And he just demonstrated a will to live that defies common sense!

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,740
He's not normal!

96
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,180
What he said makes perfect sense!

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,520
Where are vyou from?

98
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,230
East Blue.

99
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,290
Dragon...

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,150
When vyou're standing out here in the wind,

101
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,220
vyou always face the same direction, vyou know.

102
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,990
Really?

103
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,820
You notice the strangest things, don't you?

104
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,120
I've never really thought about it.

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
Then maybe it's an animal-like homing instinct?

106
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Isn't vyour hometown somewhere off in that direction?

107
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,380
Do vyou have some family vyou long for back in the eastern seas?{recheck: should this be sea or seas?}

108
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,930
Well?

109
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,850
Stop enquiring about my personal history, Iva.

110
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,280
Pardon vme.

111
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
If that's true...

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,190
If Straw-Hat-boy here really IS Dragon's son...

113
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,200
Inazuma! Go find out when Ace-boy is being taken to his execution.

114
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,820
Right away.

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,730
It'll be a race against time.

116
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,120
If the Vivre Card is pointing down,

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,270
then he hasn't been taken away yet.

118
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,000
Vi will be heading to Level Six alongside Straw-Hat-boy here.

119
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,420
You're gonna show me the way?

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,900
But... Level Six?

121
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,650
I thought it was Level Five...

122
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,160
Like he said, this is Level 5.5.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, whatever. I'm counting on you. Let's go!

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,300
Vi was careless!

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,390
Vi never even considered this!

126
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,520
That would mean Straw-Hat-boy's brother, Ace, is also Dragon's son!{holy deceptive foreshadowing, batman!}

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,170
Could the Navy be doing this intentionally?

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,620
No, Vi can see no advantage for the Government in angering both Whitebeard and Dragon!

129
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,100
What is the Government thinking?!

130
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,300
In any case, now is the time to break out of here!

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,010
Well then, Bon-chan. I'll come pick you up later, okay?

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
Straw-Hat-boy!

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,110
In the future, vyou must not let slip such information about vyour origins!

134
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,020
Yeah, you're probably right...

135
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,230
Vi am vyour father's companion.

136
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,920
One of the leaders of the revolutionary army.

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,940
That's the reason Vi was locked away here.

138
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,560
Vi might be acting of vmy own accord, but Vi have a duty to support vyou!

139
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Vi will not let a friend's son die while Vi'm around to see it!

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,750
Give the message to all inhabitants of Newkama Land!

141
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,920
Vwe will hereby attempt to save Ace-boy and break out of Impel Down!

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,930
What?! All of a sudden?!

143
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,340
You might say that, but...

144
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,310
Important decisions are always made suddenly!

145
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,040
Those who want to come along, prepare vyourselves for the worst and gather here, ready to fight!

146
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,880
Right! Wait for me, Ace!

147
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll be right there!

148
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,980
His pulse...

149
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,550
is still there!

150
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,340
It is?!

151
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,060
Emporio Tension Hormone!

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,100
It's adrenaline.

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,740
Vyou'll be able to ignore vyour fatigue for one day.

154
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,210
Vyou'll suffer some major aftereffects in exchange for it, but Vi assume vyou don't mind?

155
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,830
Mister Two, Mister Three and Buggy the Clown...

156
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,650
You're sure these three entered Level Five, right?

157
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,100
Yes. Their disguise was flawless.

158
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,660
Still, the only thing we found on Level Five was a blood-stained headdress.

159
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,690
We assume that, after Straw Hat was let out of his cage, the four of them were eaten by wolves.

160
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,850
I see.

161
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,360
I didn't think I'd have to wear this specially-made headdress before I became Warden...

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,780
I haven't even gotten rid of Magellan yet!

163
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,530
You're giving away your motives!

164
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,460
If they manage to break out again, you and the Warden might both lose your jobs.

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,860
They'll take MY job too?!

166
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,040
Inside the elevator to level 6

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
You're late.

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,050
You're so harsh, Domino.

169
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,640
Please finish up sooner next time.

170
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,420
Don't be so unreasonable...

171
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,840
We are to hand over the prisoner at the main entrance at exactly nine o'clock this morning.

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,790
That is our mission.

173
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,590
If we cannot complete it, it will tarnish the reputation of Impel Down.

174
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,940
Impel Down Main Entrance

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,780
You got it?

176
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,250
From the moment we take
Portgas D. Ace into custody...

177
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,630
Until the moment we've reached Marineford and handed the prisoner over...

178
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,350
You are not permitted to drop your guard, even for a second!

179
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,170
Yes, Sir!

180
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,080
Prepare for the worst.

181
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,540
It's the duty of our five Navy Vice-Admirals and warships to escort the prisoner without any breach of security!

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,510
I will not accept any mistakes!

183
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,170
Yes, Sir!

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh wow, I'm overflowing with energy!

185
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,100
Let us hurry.

186
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,210
Even the slightest delay could change the outcome of our actions.

187
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,170
No one is watching us here, so as long as vwe don't waste time sneaking around, vwe'll get there very fast!

188
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,420
Keep moving as fast as vyou can!

189
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,730
What's that?

190
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,380
Who're those guys running by?

191
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,100
He's...

192
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,740
Is that the same Ivankov who's supposed to be dead?!

193
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,280
No way!

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,410
MOVE IT!

195
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,330
DON'T GET IN OUR WAY!

196
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,960
Death Wink!

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,230
Inazuma! The keys!

198
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes!

199
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,380
There are surveillance cameras past this point.

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,440
If they're gonna come for us, then let 'em come!

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,390
Suspicious figures spotted!

202
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,980
Someone is running down the hallway between Levels Five and Six!

203
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,880
That man...!

204
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,350
He's the Okama Queen who vanished a few years back, Ivankov!

205
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,240
What's going on?!

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,490
Where has he been all these years?!

207
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,840
The guy next to him is the one who broke in yesterday, Straw Hat Luffy!{That was just one day? orz}

208
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,210
I thought the Warden's poison killed him!

209
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,590
And there's another prisoner we thought had vanished!

210
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,710
The revolutionary from South Blue, Inazuma!

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,590
What's going on?!

212
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,950
They're heading straight for Level Six!

213
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,380
They're after Fire Fist Ace after all?!

214
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,230
Domino-san and Warden Magellan are going to Level Six right now!

215
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,550
At this rate, they'll run right into each other!

216
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,790
They're still alive?

217
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,650
Assistant Warden!

218
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,840
Activate the traps in the corridor!

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,610
Have the guards on Level Six prepare for battle!

220
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,040
Make sure they'll hold out until Sadi-chan and the Demon Guards get there!

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,700
Also, contact Warden Magellan and alert all Floors!

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,970
Don't just stand there! Hurry up!

223
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,350
Yes, Sir!

224
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,040
The Assistant Warden is taking this seriously all of a sudden?!

225
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
Could he be an impostor?!

226
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,800
We must capture them at all costs!

227
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
They're not cutting my head off!

228
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,080
Make it! Make it!

229
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm coming now, Ace!

230
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,390
Well, then.

231
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,200
Portgas D. Ace...

232
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,700
You will now be taken to the city where your execution is to take place, Marineford!

233
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,960
Ace!!

234
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,370
Hurry up!

235
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,020
Out of the way!

236
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,280
Gomu Gomu no...

237
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,540
Ricochet!

238
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,730
The traps had no effect.

239
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,070
All guards were eliminated.

240
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,740
Straw-Hat Luffy...

241
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
Okama Queen Ivankov...

242
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,680
Revolutionary Inazuma...

243
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,870
These three criminals are now entering Level Six!

244
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,020
Where are you, Ace?!

245
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm here to save you!!

246
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,940
Ace!!

247
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,980
Is this it?!

248
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,860
Ace!

249
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,890
He's not here!

250
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,520
Are vyou sure this is the right cage?

251
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,090
There's no doubt about it!

252
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,270
I wouldn't...

253
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,330
do such a thing as lie...!

254
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,960
It seems we were one step behind.

255
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,220
A straw hat... This man...

256
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,490
It has to be!

257
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,600
She said...

258
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,950
That my brother's coming here.

259
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,660
He's really here!

260
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,540
To break into the impenetrable Impel Down...

261
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,670
and come all the way down to Level Six, he is really...

262
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,780
Hey, are you Straw-Hat Luffy?

263
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,340
Yeah.

264
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,360
They've just taken him. Chase after them!

265
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,490
Ace-san was being escorted to the lift!

266
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,900
GO! You can still make it if you hurry!

267
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,970
Old dude... Who're you?{ //Ossan }

268
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,060
He is another of the big shots!

269
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,760
Right, I got it!

270
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,790
Thanks! Whoever you are!

271
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,020
I can't believe it...

272
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,890
One or two lives shouldn't be enough to get a man down here! {Just risking one or two of your lives can't possibly be enough to get you down here... //Actually, I'm not entirely sure about this myself, but I believe this is closer.}

273
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,320
Did he really pass through all Five Hells?!

274
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,400
They must have used this to reach the upper floors.

275
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Let's go!

276
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,820
They've left the gate open for the lift!

277
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,490
Alright!

278
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,740
The mechanisms are locked; it's useless!

279
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,410
We can't use it?!

280
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,790
But if we climb this we can probably make it up-

281
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,990
Do it!

282
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,790
Yes, sir!

283
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,800
T-That was close!

284
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,390
It's to be expected.

285
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,390
It's not like they'd just let us climb up.

286
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,150
The lift is useless!

287
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,100
They're watching vour every move. {They've got their hands all over the place.}

288
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,080
Let's use the stairs vwe came down!

289
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,430
Hey... They blocked the stairs.

290
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,900
They're trying to close us in.

291
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,980
If vwe can't break this, there's no way out!

292
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,310
It's a massive gas cloud!

293
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,690
Don't tell me it's poisonous?!

294
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,830
Hey, you guys.

295
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,380
I dunno who you are, but don't make us suffer because of your stupidity.

296
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,300
Silence, you "Level Sixers"!

297
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,010
I don't care if it's poison or whatever!

298
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Wait!

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,810
It must be sleeping gas!

300
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,940
There's a limit to recklessness, Straw-Hat-boy!

301
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,480
Stop screwing around, seriously...

302
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,110
Don't come this way!

303
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,180
They're going to put everyone on this floor to sleep...

304
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,240
and then finish us off.

305
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,730
Assistant Warden

306
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,960
Level Six is now sealed!

307
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,770
The sleeping gas is powerful.

308
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,120
There's no escape.

309
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,570
Just to be safe, keep all armed guards on standby.

310
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,910
Did you report to Warden Magellan yet?

311
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,770
Just now, sir!

312
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,720
Good.

313
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,940
And with this, it seems I've managed to secure my job!

314
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,470
Now all I have to do is push the responsibility for this mess onto Magellan, and...

315
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,570
I can finally become Warden!

316
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,270
But the microphone's still on...

317
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,430
What did you say?!

318
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,990
How unfortunate for you.

319
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,140
I've been informed Straw-Hat arrived on Level Six not long after we left.

320
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,360
L-Luffy!

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,660
There are no other ways out!

322
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,460
The emergency sleeping gas was released a few moments ago.

323
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,470
Straw Hat's capture is only a matter of time now.

324
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,700
It seems the Freezing Hell wasn't enough for him.

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,110
Fortunately, your cell is now available,

326
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,900
and we can inflict our ultimate torture on him down in Level Six.

327
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,700
Luffy...

328
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,610
Don't stop!

329
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,990
Keep walking!

330
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,170
You!

331
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,940
Stop this futile resistance!

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
Luffy!!

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,850
Your brother is also a pirate by nature.

334
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,240
There's no path to salvation for him.

335
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,670
I wanted it to be a lie!

336
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,370
Why did you come, Luffy?!

337
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,210
At any rate, no matter how great a Will,

338
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,420
that amount of poison will always be fatal.

339
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,010
How did you survive it...

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,720
Straw Hat?!

341
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,860
Hey, do something!

342
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,990
The floor will be filled with gas!

343
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,440
Save me...!

344
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,740
What's with that guy?!

345
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,410
He's cutting the floor as if it was a piece of cloth!

346
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,520
What? Now he's folding it like paper.

347
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,970
He used the folded floor to seal off the gas...

348
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,810
That guy's good...

349
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,740
Inazuma ate the Choki Choki Fruit and has become a scissor-man.

350
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,740
{\an8}Choki: Sound of snipping

351
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,180
He can manipulate anything he cuts as if it were paper.

352
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,620
What, he can?

353
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,620
Don't sleep!

354
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,510
I'm also trying vmy best to endure the gas, but...

355
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,630
But...

356
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
But I'm not tired!

357
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,170
You're not tired?!

358
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,980
He's awake.

359
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,490
Hey, I wanna keep moving.

360
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,950
Crab-chan! We can't catch up to Ace now that you've closed off the stairs!

361
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,390
Sealing the stairs was the only way to stop the gas.

362
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,250
It'll be impossible to rescue him if you're unconscious.

363
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,590
I'm gonna save him even if I'm unconscious!

364
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,370
Do you realize Ace is going to be executed?!

365
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,160
Don't be too rash though.

366
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,380
The enemy's plan was simple, but we fell for it.

367
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,970
Now we're all stuck here on Level Six.

368
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,930
In this situation, there's no way to escape.

369
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,760
It's a shame, now all vwe can do is this!

370
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,560
Cut off their connection.

371
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,140
If vyou think logically, vwe just can't make it in time.

372
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,010
Ace-boy will have already been escorted to the meeting place.

373
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,410
We, on the other hand, have to deal with all the enemies standing in our way.

374
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,280
The military convoy is quite fast.

375
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,890
Observe the Vivre Card.

376
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,710
It's not pointing directly up, is it?

377
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,880
He's probably being handed over to the Navy as we speak.

378
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,880
Right now vwe need to change our attitude.

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,310
Vi will do everything in vmy power to help vyou escape this prison safely.

380
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,590
Ace-boy will most certainly be handed over to Navy Headquarters.

381
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,430
Vyou'll have to give up on him.

382
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,730
In fact, all we can do after that is trust in Whitebeard.

383
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,610
He's not the kind of man who would discard his own men!

384
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,020
He'll act in one way or another...

385
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,290
I'm going too.

386
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,300
Huh?

387
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,290
I'm going to Navy Headquarters!

388
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,050
Are vyou stupid?!

389
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,790
This is a battle between the world's greatest powers!

390
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,800
What can vyou do if you go there?

391
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,890
Do vyou realize Whitebeard's true strength?!

392
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,680
Do vyou realize the Navy's true strength in it's admirals, vice-admirals, and Warlords?!

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,440
Did vyou forget that vyou fought Magellan one on one and almost died?!

394
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,360
How many lives do you think you have to spare?!

395
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,610
What is it...

396
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,330
If I give up now,

397
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,410
I'll regret it forever!

398
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,860
This feeling...

399
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,030
I've felt it countless times before...

400
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,750
It's the exact same feeling I get when looking at Dragon!

401
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,970
Before all that, we can't even escape from this floor!

402
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,110
If you wanna escape from here, set me free.

403
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,630
I can open a hole in the ceiling.

404
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,630
So how about it?

405
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,860
You...!

406
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,220
You're a prisoner here?!

407
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,680
Crocodile!

408
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
Former Royal Shichibukai

409
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
Former Baroque Works President (Mr. 0)

410
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
Pirate

411
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
Sir Crocodile

412
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,880
Long time no see!

413
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,630
I'd been thinking that even if I were on the outside, there'd be nothing going on to interest me.

414
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,290
But now I hear the Whitebeard Pirates and the Navy are going to war?

415
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,890
I never thought I'd get the chance to take that old man's head.

416
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,850
I'm interested in this war.

417
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,730
With my powers, we can all escape from here.

418
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,990
It's not a bad deal, is it?

419
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,940
We've both got something to gain from it.

420
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,420
Get real!

421
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,720
You're the one who messed up Vivi's country...

422
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,500
That's all in the past.

423
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,670
I no longer have any interest in that country.

424
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,120
Let's release him, Straw-Hat-boy.

425
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,270
He would certainly make a powerful ally.

426
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,360
Iva-chan! That guy's...

427
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,320
Vyou're not stopping here.

428
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,730
If vyou're going to Navy HQ, vyou'll need him even more.

429
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,990
Ivankov...!

430
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,730
Long time no see, Croco-boy.

431
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,440
What? You know him?

432
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,870
Vwe've met...

433
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,750
Back when he was still a rookie.

434
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,440
It'll be alright.

435
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,360
Even if he were to try to betray vus, Vi can hold him back.

436
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,640
Vi can't completely trust him, but...

437
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,560
Vi've got a firm grasp on this guy's weakness.

438
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,850
As long as vyou're a good boy and help us out, Vi won't say a thing.

439
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,770
Why, you...!

440
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,140
What the hell? In that case, release me too!

441
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,150
Me too! I've got a grudge against that Whitebeard!

442
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,860
Release me too!

443
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,270
Silence!

444
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,080
Death Wink!

445
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,810
I beg of you!

446
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,100
Please, take me with you!

447
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,820
I'll definitely be able to help you!

448
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,020
I've known Ace-san ever since he joined the Whitebeard Pirates!

449
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,790
He's told me everything about you, his little brother!

450
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm here because I was opposed to this war!

451
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,490
I wish to save Ace-san!

452
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,590
Please! Let me choose the place of my death!

453
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,980
He's another of the big shots.

454
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,380
The Warlord Jinbei, Knight of the Sea...

455
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,860
and Portgas D. Ace, commander of Whitebeard's second division.

456
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,580
I never thought a connection like that could exist.

457
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,740
Sure.

458
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,280
Hey, is that really okay?!

459
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,810
We know nothing of this guy's personality or how dangerous he might be!

460
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,960
It's fine. Let him out.

461
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,860
I am most grateful.

462
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,850
Hey! I'm also most grateful!

463
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,180
I beg of you!

464
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,110
Silence!

465
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,300
Death Wink!

466
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,570
I'd never have thought we'd be bringing two Warlords along...

467
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,280
Two? Who's the other one?

468
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm grateful to you.

469
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,700
Now, I might be able to be of some use to him.

470
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,650
Even if you were able to prevent the war between Whitebeard and the Navy...

471
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,070
it wouldn't matter in the long run.

472
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,920
One way or another, I will definitely take that old man's head.

473
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,070
I won't let you lay a hand on old Whitebeard, Crocodile!

474
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,960
In that case, maybe I should just kill you now?

475
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,820
Croco-boy! Vyour past, remember?

476
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,180
Well then. There's no time to waste.

477
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,560
Vwe're gonna force our way out of this prison!
