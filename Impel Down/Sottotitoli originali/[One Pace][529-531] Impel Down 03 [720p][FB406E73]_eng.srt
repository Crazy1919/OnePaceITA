1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,180
The Government calls me a pirate who hates pirates...

2
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,860
But your group is a different matter.

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,640
"Hates pirates"? You do?

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,350
I suppose you would be surprised...

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,440
I spent a lot of time on Whitebeard's ship, but...

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,110
Because of my status, I had to travel underwater to get there.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,600
I do like you guys, after all.

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,810
I seem to recall that you almost killed me once, though...

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,980
Well, you almost killed me too, didn't you?

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,520
I simply wanted to help him...

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,720
After all, Fishman Island is at peace, only because of old Whitebeard.

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,190
All pirates who travel the Grand Line pass through Fishman Island...

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
Shortly after the Great Pirate Era began, Fishman Island was thrown into chaos.

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,420
It was flooded with too many human pirates for us to hold back...

15
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,910
As well as the marines chasing after them.

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,780
Countless mermaids and fishmen were kidnapped and sold,

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,380
and just as everyone had closed their eyes against the despair...

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,100
Whitebeard appeared.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,740
This island belongs to me now!

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,790
Those words were all it took!

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,600
After that, nobody was able to lay a hand on Fishman Island.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,260
Such power!

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,510
I will never forget that day!

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
And like that he protected countless islands by claiming them as his own.

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,180
He's the pirate boss, so we can't let him fall!

26
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,500
What do you think would happen to the oceans if he were to die?!

27
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,530
The era of chaos would resume.

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,280
Anyone should be able to understand that!

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,280
The Government must have realized this too!

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,400
I wanted to stop this fight, even if it cost me my life.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,230
I wanted to save you, Ace-san...

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,950
Jinbei... please stop.

33
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,120
You're being too hard on yourself...

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,190
I still haven't abandoned hope.

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,190
I have faith in miracles and chance.

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,600
Seems like things have gotten pretty interesting out there.

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,600
This sounds like a perfect chance to take down Whitebeard...

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,540
The thought of it makes my blood boil.

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,280
Why, you!

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,250
You're saying you want to take the old man's head?

41
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,890
I ain't the only one.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,960
Kill Whitebeard!

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,220
That bastard's gonna die, you say?!

44
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,470
Now, I like that! Sounds great!

45
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,370
Let me out to sea!

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll be the one to take his head!

47
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,410
Let me fight too!

48
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,940
I'll bring an end to the era of Whitebeard!

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,410
Be silent, fools!

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,660
Jinbei. Fire Fist.

51
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,350
Remember this well.

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,360
Try and count those who were forced to swallow their tears after being unable to beat Whitebeard or Roger...

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,060
And you'll find thousands and thousands of 'em across the sea.

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,690
That explains why we couldn't contact them...

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,450
The surveillance room on Level 2 has been crushed by the basilisk!

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,760
They beat the basilisk?!

57
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,320
Where are those two?!

58
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,890
What's going on in Level 2?!

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,690
There's someone there!

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,700
You've found them?

61
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,030
Yeah, but...

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
It seems like there are three of them now.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,330
What?!

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
The Demonic Beast Floor

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Rubber...

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,500
Bara Bara...

67
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,540
Candle...

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,240
Pistol!
Cannon!
Lock!

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,890
That giant centipede exploded!

70
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,900
It was made up of several puzzle scorpions!

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,660
They're poisonous!

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,730
They just keep on coming!

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,240
See, I told you so.

74
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,140
They were completely fooled by my "Fake Legs Master-Plan"!

75
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,080
You just blew our cover!

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
Damn it!

77
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,790
Oh, and I heard that the boss of the beasts in Level Two was some sort of lion-like thing...

78
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,790
Is it those guys?

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,660
No! Those are lions with human faces, manticores!

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,000
Guard

81
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
If they catch us, they'll eat us, even our bones!

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Even our bones?!

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,500
Keys...

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,770
Please, give us the keys...

85
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,170
Ignore them!

86
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,010
They are simply able to imitate human speech because their faces are human-like!

87
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,980
Please, help!

88
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,710
It hurts... It's so painful...!

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,820
They are only imitating what they've heard the prisoners say. They don't even know what it means!

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,480
C-Creepy...

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Loincloth! Loincloth!

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,900
Strawberry panties!

93
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,190
They're just repeating dumb stuff!

94
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,190
Beef steak!

95
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
Don't react!

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,900
Hey, you!

97
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,000
You said you'd lend us a hand, right?

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
Of course I did!

99
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,170
After all, we should combine our resources to escape from here, should we not?!

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,680
How do I get further down?

101
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,580
I'm headed for Level 3!

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,700
What? You don't intend to escape?!

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,150
Are you not climbing up to Level 1?!

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,050
Straw Hat plans to free his brother, Ace.

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,340
What?! Brother?!

106
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,900
Straw Hat, you and Fire Fist Ace are siblings?!

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,450
And you're going to rescue him?!

108
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm in a hurry!

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,660
If that Ace-guy is being kept here, he must be in Level 5.

110
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,340
You're going to a place like that...

111
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,040
Stop joking around!

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,670
You must be insane!

113
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,670
I'm getting out of here!

114
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,680
Wait!

115
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
In that case, could you at least tell me where the stairs are?

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,210
The stairs...?

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
That's right!

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,380
The stairs to Level 1 also continue down to Level 3!

119
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,100
I can use Straw Hat to distract the beast guarding the stairs!

120
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,980
And that is where he and I will part.

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,740
Alright, Straw Hat. Let us go on together!

122
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,080
Leave it to me, Straw Hat!

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,660
Follow me...

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,770
There's something here...

125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,750
{\an8}It is the guardian of the stairs, the Sphinx!

126
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,080
Guard

127
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,080
(Man-faced feathered lion)

128
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,690
I-It's a lion? No, an old guy?

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,630
Omelet rice!

130
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,630
Beef steak!

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,270
White noodles.

132
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,350
W-white noodles?!

133
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,820
Pulled noodles!

134
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,020
Tan noodles!

135
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,350
It's learned all the noodle-types!

136
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,890
Pork noodles!

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,490
Handsome men!

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,490
{\an8}Ikemen: Handsome man

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,020
You called?

140
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,800
This guy's dangerous!

141
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,180
Is this...?

142
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,180
The Sphinx is running wild off in the distance!

143
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,240
There's no way in hell we'd be able to escape from here!

144
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,340
Korean black soy noodles!

145
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,140
Dammit, how strong is that thing?!

146
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,360
Come to think of it, isn't it his fault we wound up here anyway?

147
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,490
I was thinking the same thing.

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,820
Right! Then, our "Escape Alliance" is hereby formed!

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
I sure am glad there is someone here who genuinely values freedom!

150
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,700
Well then, let's commence our "Straw-Hat-is-Our-Decoy-Plan"!

151
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,940
Hey, what're you guys doing?

152
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,460
H-Here it comes, Straw Hat!

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,000
Rubber Bazooka!

154
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,650
Why would you upset it on purpose?!

155
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,150
Oh crap!

156
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,860
You two are so unfair!

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,900
Escaping up to the high ground like that!

158
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,780
Pulled noodles!

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,640
You fell for it, you simple-minded creature!

160
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,050
That is a wax-statue I created using my candle powers!

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,660
Steamboat noodles...

162
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,810
It doesn't have Miss Goldenweek's brilliant coloring...

163
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,560
But it is quite sufficient to fool a beast such as yourself!

164
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,400
Which one is authentic?

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,940
Wrong!

166
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,650
Wrong!

167
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Wrong!

168
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,990
That's so cool! It's a game of Whack-a-mole!

169
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,310
Wrong!

170
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,620
Wrong!

171
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,690
There he is!

172
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,770
Wrong!

173
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,590
You got it wrong. How about that one?

174
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,590
Wrong!

175
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,710
Wrong!

176
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,960
He's playing around with the Sphinx!

177
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,310
Straw Hat, how carefree can you get?!

178
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,010
You're in on it too, huh?

179
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,710
They're enjoying this more than I thought they would... Well, now's my chance!

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,910
Hey, what's up with these strange tremors?

181
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,220
How long are they gonna keep upsetting the Sphinx?

182
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
What?!

183
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,610
Can this floor even withstand all this?

184
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,850
This is Level 3!

185
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,600
We've lost contact with several monitors! We're hearing some really loud noises from above!

186
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,970
Mr. 3! Now's our chance!

187
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
Seems like the operation was a success!

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,430
This was nothing like what I planned!

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,910
In any case, let's run!

190
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,850
Is that the door to the stairs?

191
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,130
I'll make a key out of wax!

192
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,090
This is the monitoring room!

193
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,150
We still can't get any response from Level 2!

194
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,530
We have no idea what's going on!

195
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,300
That stupid monster!

196
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,930
He's caused the entire floor to crack!

197
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,040
This is Level 3!

198
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,650
A monster is falling through the ceiling!

199
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,260
This is bad!

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,630
Hey! That's Level 3 below us, ya know!

201
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,570
Sorry noodles!

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,670
Monitor room! We are at the scene on Level 2.

203
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,670
Can you see the image?

204
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
Yeah! Keep us updated!

205
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,010
Roger that!

206
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,850
What happened here?!

207
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,920
This hole is big enough for even
the Sphinx to fall through!

208
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,420
What does Straw Hat Luffy want?

209
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,480
Look! This is bad!

210
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,480
The prisoners on Level 2 are all
free! How did they get the keys?!

211
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,290
Are they responsible for this too?!

212
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,850
Those guards are in trouble!

213
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,610
Let's hear it for Captain Buggy!

214
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,790
He's our savior!

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,930
L-Level 2 reporting! We need backup pronto!

216
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,230
The prisoners are...

217
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,530
rioting!

218
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,870
Send Blugoris to Level 2!

219
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,530
We've just received word of Straw Hat Luffy's intent!

220
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,420
You did?! From whom?!

221
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,350
Fleet Admiral Sengoku at the Headquarters sent word!

222
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,290
The invader - Monkey D. Luffy and the condemned prisoner - Portgas D. Ace,

223
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,130
those two are brothers!

224
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,050
What?!

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Then he came here to rescue "Fire Fist" Ace before the public execution?!

226
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,310
Yeah, there's no doubt!

227
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,010
That explains why he keeps going down!

228
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,690
We were focused on Whitebeard's attack!

229
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,610
If he pulls this off, the
tide will turn against us!

230
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,750
Inform Warden Magellan at once!

231
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,280
And get the riot on Level 2 under control!

232
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,630
Navy

233
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,130
What's so funny, Garp?!

234
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,990
We're standing at a crossroads that could change the world,

235
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,380
but he keeps causing problems one after another!

236
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,880
At Enies Lobby...

237
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,450
And the time with the Celestial Dragons...

238
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,090
All of this has been unprecedented!

239
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,600
And this time he's meddling with a prison where no-one's escaped for 20 years!

240
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Ever since the abhorrent Golden Lion, a prison which has never been breached...

241
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,970
known for so long as a robust and iron-tight great fortress - Impel Down!

242
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,010
He has disgraced its name by being the first to penetrate its walls!

243
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,120
How could he be your grandson, Garp?!

244
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,090
He sure has accomplished a lot! I'm proud of my grandson!

245
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,930
Damn Bartholomew Kuma!

246
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,230
He said that he took care of the
Straw Hats at Sabaody Archipelago!

247
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,530
I knew that he was lying!

248
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,770
You weren't going to trust the word of a Shichibukai, were you?

249
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,040
Anyway I wonder how he got through the Navy's impregnable defenses...

250
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,780
Maybe he flew in?

251
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,110
Cut the crap! If you weren't known as the hero of the Navy,

252
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,620
I would have made you take full responsibility for your family, Garp!

253
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,630
You can take this old man's life but the situation is far more serious than that!

254
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,800
It's not funny!

255
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,690
This has all been the Navy's blundering!

256
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,300
Do you realize how much Tsuru and I worked to deal with the aftermath?!

257
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,810
Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

258
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,310
Shut up!

259
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,720
Hot!

260
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,750
Ow ow ow...

261
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,410
Ow ow ow! This floor is like a frying pan!

262
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,480
Are we in the desert?! It's so hot!

263
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,810
Why is it so quiet?

264
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,250
Level 3! Oh I never wanted to come here!

265
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Straw Hat! I'm doomed along with you again!

266
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,960
Oh! Looks like the lion's taking a cat nap!

267
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,270
This is especially difficult for me and my wax powers.

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,140
Alright, let's just go.

269
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,780
Wow! Grilled chicken is served!

270
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,110
Don't be ridiculous!

271
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,260
That's a hummingbird that fluttered down from upstairs and got grilled in the air.

272
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,920
How hot is it in here?!

273
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,160
Hey, can we just get in...

274
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,170
Isn't it a miserable sight?

275
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:18,880
Prisoners on this floor were once all tough criminals with over 50,000,000 belly bounties.

276
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,500
The heat from the Burning Heat Hell underneath...

277
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:30,890
along with depriving them of food and water has made them half dead.

278
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,800
This is Level 3 - the Starvation Hell!

279
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,540
Now you know why this floor is covered with sand.

280
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:54,150
Odds are the sand beneath us
are remains of a prisoner who dried up.

281
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,120
If we stay here too long, we will become like them before we know it.

282
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,250
We have to get away from here while we still have sweat to spare.

283
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,390
Alright, let's hurry down to Level 4!

284
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,370
As if!

285
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,210
Hey, not that way! We gotta take the stairs on the left.

286
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,010
Oh yeah?

287
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,870
No, we should take the pass on the right.

288
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,880
Which one is it?!

289
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,700
Why...

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,290
...are we back where we started from?!

291
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,250
I hope we make it to Level 4 soon.

292
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,790
We told you, we're not going!

293
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,790
You have to guide me!

294
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,890
You said that we were gonna save Ace together!

295
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,500
We never said that!

296
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,170
Stop imagining things as you want them to be!

297
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,800
Didn't you say you would?

298
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,300
They are in!

299
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,400
Alright, draw the net!

300
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,410
Yes sir!

301
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
I'm going on my own, then!

302
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,290
Huh?

303
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,280
What's this?!

304
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,100
Oh no! It's a trap! They got us already!

305
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,940
It's made of iron!

306
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,440
I can't use my Bara Bara Fruit power!

307
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,570
Of course it contains Sea Prism Stone!

308
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,850
They're gonna torture us for attempting to break out.

309
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,950
We're goners.

310
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,950
The invader Straw Hat Luffy has been captured, along with two others!

311
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,990
What do you mean "two others?!"

312
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,690
Don't antagonize them Buggy-kun!

313
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,090
It's over.

314
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,600
Damn it! I gotta rip this net!

315
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,990
There are guards and Blugoris here!

316
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,200
Put the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs on them!

317
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,110
Roger!

318
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,510
Damn! Damn! Damn!

319
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,350
Who're you?

320
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,810
{\an8}Saru-desu: I'm a monkey.

321
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,810
I'm Saldeath.

322
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,550
Huh, really? But you don't look like one.

323
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,250
No!

324
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
You're not listening.

325
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm Saldeath.

326
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,550
Huuh, really?

327
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,350
No! Get it right! It's my name!

328
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,560
Give up.

329
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,660
Chief Guard
Saldeath

330
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,660
(Blugori Commander)

331
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,510
{\an8}It's no use holding out.

332
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,790
{\an8}There's no place to get away in this isolated underwater prison!

333
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,370
It's lucky you were caught by me.

334
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,210
Because there are four demon guards prowling around on the floors beyond this.

335
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,050
What?!

336
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,630
He's right! I don't wanna face them and the warden!

337
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,030
Vongole bianco!

338
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,650
Oh, Chief!

339
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,980
Soup spaghetti!

340
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,350
He's onto pasta now!

341
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,040
We're gonna get squashed!

342
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,210
Spaghetti!

343
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,610
The Sphinx is awake!

344
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Oh no, he's gonna break the net!

345
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,050
Don't let those three, especially Straw Hat, get away!

346
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,120
Deep-fried noodles!

347
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,930
He's back on noodles again!

348
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,060
He must've been going through a phase!

349
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,590
Yay!

350
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,450
This is great! Now we can run!

351
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,390
Get them!

352
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,210
Rubber...

353
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,370
Gatling!

354
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,280
Oh? Where did those two go?

355
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,540
Hurry up, Mr. 3!

356
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,390
I can't move quickly due to this heat...

357
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,060
Ah! They climbed up the net!

358
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,290
Straw Hat!

359
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,070
If you see Ace tell him that I said "Hello" and
"Let's have a drink if I ever see you again alive!"

360
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,410
Be a good little live bait for us, stupid!

361
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,580
I was happy to see you were alright but... Alright! See ya!

362
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,120
Thanks for helping me!

363
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,130
Ugh! How sweet!

364
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,090
Ouch! It's heartbreaking!

365
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,620
Stay sharp! He is a pirate with a 300,000,000 belly bounty!

366
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,130
Now is our chance to run!

367
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,790
Alright!

368
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,410
I don't have time to fight you all!

369
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,210
Buckwheat noodles!

370
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,290
Oh no! He's still around!

371
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,070
You bastard!

372
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,510
He's gonna run! Chase him!

373
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,750
Where are the stairs to go down?!

374
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,450
It's hot...

375
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,610
We'll be safe here! They're after Straw Hat as we wished.

376
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,490
They closed up the staircase going up.

377
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,430
It's already too much for me to stay here.

378
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,150
Un deux faint!

379
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,960
Un deux come on!

380
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,990
Un deux faint!

381
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,950
Who's singing?

382
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,450
Un deux come on!

383
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,990
Un deux faint!

384
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,270
Un deux come on!

385
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,780
You know this world is about a man and a woman!

386
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,390
But when you're an okama you're a little of both!

387
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,250
That's why we're the greatest!

388
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,510
The greatest!

389
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,720
The greatest!

390
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,720
The greatest!

391
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,060
The okama way is the greatest!

392
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,110
The greatest!

393
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,860
The greatest!

394
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,360
The greatest!

395
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,310
The okama way!

396
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,100
The okama waaay!

397
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,330
You guys are doing great!

398
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,140
I spin and spin like I'm caught up in the tide of the times!

399
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,830
This way!

400
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,110
Wait! Listen to me! That's...

401
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,290
Guys! You can't be that tired!

402
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,260
This stifling heat is nothing!

403
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,260
I can be even more stifling!

404
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,370
Oh! If it isn't Mr. 3!

405
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,810
Just as I thought. It's you...

406
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,650
What?! Mr. 3?!

407
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,610
Hey wait a minute! Why're you here?!

408
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,130
You're behind bars so you've been caught?!

409
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,970
No no. The one who has been caught is me!

410
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,110
I was so surprised I had to do a double take with an "Okama Way" Kenpo called...

411
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,770
Looking Back on that Autumn Night's Dream!

412
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,270
Hey! What kind of creature is this?!

413
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,540
Let's be sure not to let him out.

414
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,320
What're you saying?! Let me out!

415
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,320
How did he slip through our tight security?!

416
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,150
There's just one invader.

417
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:02,910
But if Ace were to be rescued, Impel Down, as well as
the World Government, would be humiliated!

418
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,600
We're gonna get into that prison,

419
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,110
and in the name of Navy Headquarters, we must catch Straw Hat Luffy!

420
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,480
Wait a minute!

421
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
W-Who are you?!

422
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm Sadie-chan who loves torturing people!

423
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,850
Impel Down
Security Chief

424
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,850
Sadie-chan

425
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
{\an8}After being breached by an intruder taking Navy help,

426
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,000
{\an8}would only further disgrace Impel Down's name!

427
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,100
She can't be serious, using "chan" to refer to herself...

428
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,320
Shut up!

429
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,600
You better call me "Sadie-chan!"

430
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,920
I can't resist those screams!

431
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,220
Damn you!

432
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,090
Hold it! Are you saying that you don't need our help?

433
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,940
Yes. This prison is a labyrinthine hell.

434
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,300
If you don't know it well, you can't help us!

435
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,940
We'd appreciate your help if you just guard the outside.

436
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,210
We'll raise this drawbridge which is the only entrance to the prison...

437
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,410
...and seal off Impel Down completely!

438
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,420
Don't worry. There is no way out...

439
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,590
...of this underwater prison!

440
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,460
Alright, then we'll guard the outside.

441
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,790
Yes, that's a good boy.

442
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
A koala?

443
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,040
You're kidding me!

444
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,340
A koala.

445
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,320
A koala?

446
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
A koala.

447
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,440
Impel Down is now completely sealed off!

448
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,670
Hannyabal?!

449
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,670
Magellan's here too. What's going on?

450
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,120
You have a special visitor, Ace!

451
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Guess who's here!

452
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,420
Jinbe! Even you have never met her before,

453
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,620
so there's no way that Ace can guess who it is.

454
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,270
She's well-known but never shows herself! She leads the Kuja - the tribe of warriors!

455
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,800
She's one of the Royal Shichibukai!

456
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,310
Strong, noble, and the most beautiful woman in the world!

457
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,610
She is the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

458
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,450
Yeah yeah, Hancock! Hancock-sama!

459
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,620
Yo, goddess! When I become warden, will you marry me?!

460
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,230
Please!

461
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,640
Ouch! I really wanna become the warden!

462
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,800
Ah, I got it wrong. I mean it really hurts to be hit by the warden!

463
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,140
What are you doing?!

464
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,140
Wow! For real?! She is so beautiful!

465
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,300
So she's the Snake Princess of the Kuja? Hey, turn around!

466
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,120
Hancock-chan!

467
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,320
Look how sexy she is!

468
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,820
Young lady! Come to our cell!

469
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,520
We will love you tenderly!

470
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,090
What a good smell! I wanna visit the Maiden Island!

471
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,000
There's only women and everybody's naked there right?

472
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,570
What do you want from me?

473
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,710
Nothing. I just wanted to take a look at you.

474
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,710
Because you will become the cause of the war that I will take part in.

475
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,910
So I'm worth a look then?

476
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,920
Boa Hancock! Are you ignoring us?!

477
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,940
Come here!

478
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,260
You've always been an empress with a strong will who never obeyed any summonses...

479
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,030
But you're taking part in this war?

480
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,030
Suddenly you value your title of Shichibukai?!

481
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,340
So you're Jinbe. Don't snarl at me.

482
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,710
Yo yo, young lady! Young lady!

483
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,910
They're talking! Shut your mouths!

484
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,580
Shut up Magellan, you round-the-clock diarrhea man!

485
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,430
Yeah, he's right!

486
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,090
Hey, Snake Princess!

487
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,090
I bet the girls on the Maiden Island are hungry for us guys!

488
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,190
Hey you! Give me your post as warden!

489
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,560
Vice Warden.

490
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
You guys!

491
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
She turned!

492
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,530
You keep taunting me with those coarse voices...

493
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,070
I'm scared!

494
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,770
Oh god! I can't resist!

495
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,380
How cute she is! Let us have her, Diarrhea Man!

496
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,210
This is the vilest place in the world! It makes me sick!

497
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,220
The prisoners call you "Diarrhea Man."
How can you stand it, Warden?

498
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,220
They must've crushed any pride you take in your job...

499
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,230
Wow! She's irresistible!

500
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,430
Shame on you, Diarrhea Man!

501
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,660
However...

502
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,530
Let me have her, Diarrhea Man!

503
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,000
Diarrhea Man! Let me have Hancock!

504
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm infuriated at their rudeness!

505
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,950
Wha-! Warden, w-w-wait!

506
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,290
That's gonna harm us too! No!

507
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,060
You've gotten carried away!

508
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,080
Ugh! Oh man!

509
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,500
I have to show you...

510
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,640
who is boss in this prison!

511
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,600
What're you doing?!

512
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,490
Stop, Magellan!

513
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,090
You fool! We were just joking! Don't!

514
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920
That bastard... He seriously did it!

515
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,960
T-That's it! You're gonna die!

516
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,250
I need... I need an antidote! Shit!

517
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,900
Never forget that I have the authority and the ability to execute each and every one of you at my whim!

518
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:30,310
All right, Hancock-dono. You can talk freely now.

519
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,820
I'm done.

520
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,790
Hey! Is what you just told me true?!

521
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,350
Why would I lie to you?

522
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,840
Oh yeah.

523
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,490
He was worried that you might get mad.

524
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,660
Are you done already?

525
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,670
What were they talking about?

526
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,370
Beats me. I was trying really hard to get away from you.

527
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,610
Ace-san.

528
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,040
What did she just tell you?

529
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,050
She said that my brother's here!

530
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,550
What?! The one with a straw hat that you always talk about?!

531
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,020
That's insane!

532
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,960
Ah? I didn't notice, but I'm climbing now! I wanna go down!

533
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,840
But I guess If I keep going, it's gonna go downwards at some point!

534
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm hungry!

535
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,010
We got an image! He's about to enter district C!

536
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,810
Alright I see him!

537
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,090
Sea Prism Stone nets again!

538
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,730
That was close!

539
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,030
Oh no! The lion!

540
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,770
Damnit!

541
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,280
Wait a minute, lion!

542
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm here to help you!

543
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,250
Zoro!

544
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,160
I fooled you!

545
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,930
Swan Arabesque!

546
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,670
Swan swan!

547
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,670
Oh?

548
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,230
Spin spin! I'm spinning!

549
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,610
He's not Zoro but he sounds familiar...

550
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,960
It's been a long time! Straw-chan, it's me!

551
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,410
Bon-chan!

552
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:08,710
I'm so disappointed that you're not Zoro, but at least you're alive!

553
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,990
It's our chance! Get Straw Hat!

554
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,430
Go away!

555
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,980
You assholes! What do you think you're doing to my friend?!

556
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,320
Yeah, Sphinx! Fight back!

557
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,610
Okay! He's not gonna attack us after getting busted up like this!

558
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,770
You gotta get rough to teach a wild animal a lesson!

559
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,110
Fried noodle bun...

560
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,830
Hey Bon-chan! I thought that you were dead...

561
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,150
after sacrificing yourself for us!

562
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,160
Gimme a break! Okamas never die!

563
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,910
Oh, is that right?!

564
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,630
{\an8}Let's see how Mr. 2 Bon Clay's power works!

565
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,730
{\an8}He ate the Clone Fruit and turned into a Clone Man.

566
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,670
{\an8}He can turn into anyone whose face has been touched by his right hand.

567
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,380
{\an8}He turned into Zoro because he touched him before.

568
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,370
Here's another escapee!

569
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,060
He keeps gaining friends as he descends deeper and deeper!

570
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,030
Blugoris! Don't let them get away!

571
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,070
By the way Straw-chan, I heard that you wanna get to Level 5!

572
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,390
Indeed! Can you show me the way?

573
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,610
Alright, I'll go with you!

574
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,020
Actually, there's someone that I wanna see on Level 5!

575
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,520
Really?!

576
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,950
Okay, then let's do it together!

577
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,020
Uh-huh!

578
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,890
Let's go!

579
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,360
Yeah!
