00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,230
Guys! I see an island!

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,220
Hmm...

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,600
Looks like it's an uninhabited island.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,580
Ready the anchor! We'll land on the island!

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,540
Well then, go find some foodstuffs.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,860
Yeah!

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,410
Listen. No rats or frogs, okay?

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,710
How self-centered you are. Once it's in your stomach, it's all the same.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,560
Hey, Chopper. Were you able to find any medicinal herbs?

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,860
Yep. I've collected most of them, but there may be even rarer ones on this island.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,060
More importantly, something's been bugging me for a while.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,120
I wonder what this weird groove is that runs down this path...

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Come to think of it, yeah, I wonder what it is.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,900
It looks as if a bicycle passed by.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,490
Hey, hey. This is an uninhabited island, right?

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,360
This can't be a trace of a bicycle when there's no one here.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,400
That's true.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,870
Hey, we're almost through the jungle!

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
We're suddenly out in a large open space.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,020
Ahh!

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,300
What's with Chopper?

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,300
He's headed to that rock. Is there something there?

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Ahh!

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,930
That darn Chopper!

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,680
He must be trying to have that huge mushroom all to himself!

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,720
Hold it!

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,060
What's the matter, Chopper?!

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,530
Looks like something happened. Let's go!

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,990
Ow, ow, ow... Hm?

Whoa! What the heck is this?!

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,920
Ahh... Hmm?

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,250
A raccoon dog?

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,870
I'm a reindeer! See? I've got antlers!

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,130
Are you okay, Chopper?!

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,420
Who the heck is this?!

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,630
What happened?!

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,680
What's going on, Luffy?!

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,800
What's with you guys?

40
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,510
What's with you?!

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,480
Wh-Who's that huge guy?

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
Who's that guy?!

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Robin!

44
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,990
What's wrong, Robin-chan?!

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,220
Robin!

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,410
Wh... Why are you frozen?

47
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,920
Robin...

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh-ho-ho?

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,620
Now, now. Don't be so bloodthirsty, guys.

50
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,540
It's not like I'm here on orders.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,380
Since it's a nice day, I took a stroll here.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,170
Orders?! From what organization?!

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,220
Oh, my, my, you've turned into a good-looking woman...

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,940
Nico Robin.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,390
It's all right! Now let's move forward

56
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,860
with the sun always in our hearts

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,320

If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

under the same flag-- together, we're one

81
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,480
Navy HQ Admiral Aokiji

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,200
To think that he got Robin this shaken up...

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,180
Who is he?

84
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,590
He's a marine.

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,660
Navy Headquarters Admiral... Aokiji.

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,260
Admiral?!

87
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,430
A... Admiral? He's that high up?

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,570
There're only three officers in the Navy who hold the position of Admiral.

89
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,800
Akainu...

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,500
Aokiji...

91
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,300
Kizaru...

92
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
The only one above them is Fleet Admiral Sengoku, who reigns as the top official in the Navy.

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,740
That man is one of the three men called the World Government's ultimate powerhouses.

94
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,000
Wh-Why is someone like that here?!

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,360
Why don't you go deal with big-time pirates with several-hundred-million-Berry bounties?!

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,140
G... Go someplace else!

97
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,680
Hm?

98
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,720
Oh, my, my...

99
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,120
Here's another sexy lady with super big bazongas! Are you free tonight?

100
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,470
What's the big idea, you tall, lanky jerk?!

101
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,530
Pay attention, you jerk!

102
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,430
Hold on a sec, you guys, geez...

103
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,790
Did you hear what I said?

104
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,560
I said I just took a stroll, didn't I?
Don't get so worked up.

105
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,400
To start with, you guys are... whatchamacallit... you know...

106
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,850
"Wh-Whatchamacallit"?

107
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,310
Err...

108
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,910
I forgot. Oh, well.

109
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,350
You don't make much sense!

110
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,830
What the heck's with this guy?!

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,410
Hey, Robin, aren't you mistaking him for someone else?

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,730
There's no way someone like him is a Navy Admiral!

113
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,210
Hey, hey... Don't judge others by their appearance.

114
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,130
My motto as a marine is "lazy justice."

115
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,050
That totally matches your appearance!

116
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,210
In any case, well...

117
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,670
Oh, excuse me for a sec...

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,590
Standing made me tired. Umph.

119
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,340
Then why were you sleeping standing up?

120
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,230
Anyway, to make a long story short,

121
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,550
I have no intention of capturing you guys, so don't worry.

122
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,690
I came to check the whereabouts of Nico Robin, who disappeared after the Alabasta incident, that's all.

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,290
Just as I thought, she's been with you guys.

124
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,910
This guy sure is apathetic, isn't he?

125
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,440
His audacity shows he's a leader, in a manner of speaking.

126
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,310
I'm going to at least report this to Headquarters, though.

127
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,910
With another wanted person, the total bounty for you guys has now changed.

128
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,190
100 million... plus 60 million... plus 79 million equals...

129
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,890
I don't know exactly, but I'm sure it's not too shabby.

130
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,340
Why don't you calculate it?

131
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,050
Rubber!

132
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,610
Hold on a sec! Hold on, Luffy!

133
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,810
Stop it! Stop it!

134
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,350
Let me go! What're you guys doing?!

135
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,150
What's the point in us picking a fight?!

136
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,230
He's one of the strongest marines!

137
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,550
So what?! Then are you saying we're gonna hand over Robin without a fight?!

138
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,820
You jerk!

139
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,280
Well, you guys... I'm saying I'm not gonna do anything, aren't I?

140
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,670
I'm gonna beat him up!

141
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,990
Stop it, Luffy!

142
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,010
Like I said several times already, I took a stroll.

143
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,610
Oh, it was a stroll? Then don't go passing a place like this! Leave!

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,570
You don't make sense.

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,880
Luffy kinda has the upper hand here.

146
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,010
S-So you're a marine... I wish you had told us sooner.

147
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,010
Who are these people?

148
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,510
Hey, get hold of yourselves.

149
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,550
Then this isn't an uninhabited island?

150
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,410
Well, they're probably the passengers who drifted here from a wrecked ship.

151
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,230
About a month ago, there was a report that a passenger liner went missing in this area.

152
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,570
Well, then... Okay. I'm going back, but before that...

153
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,410
You guys, get ready to depart right away.

154
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,170
Fortunately, there's an inhabited island not so far from here.

155
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,550
You should go there to get the treatment you need.

156
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,800
Hey, you guys! You don't have to listen to this guy! He's a marine!

157
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,210
Is there a problem?

158
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,930
Oh... That's right. It's fine, it's fine. That's right. It's fine.

159
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,590
Normally, marines are your friends and we are the bad guys, huh?

160
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,550
It's no time for laughing!

161
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,250
He said he'd help those guys.

162
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,050
But does he have a ship?

163
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,190
Besides ours, I didn't see any other ships anywhere.

164
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,950
There's no ship. They don't have a Log Pose, either.

165
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,790
How are they supposed to go to that nearby island?

166
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,150
Oh, they'll be fine.

167
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,910
Nothing you say sounds convincing, you know.

168
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,900
It's true...

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,900
Hm?

170
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,190
That man can make it happen.

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,530
All right, done!

172
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,390
We loaded up food and water. With this much, you'll be fine for a while.

173
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,010
It's nice to work once in a while.

174
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,470
Yeah, it feels good! You're quite a sensible guy!

175
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,260
He hit it off with him after all.

176
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,610
So what're you gonna do?

177
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,850
Are you gonna swim while pulling these guys and this stuff?

178
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,690
No way.

179
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,050
Step back a bit.

180
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,890
Wh-What the heck?!

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,850
A sea animal! I bet that's the guardian of this area of the sea!

182
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,710
What?! Hey, you! Run!

183
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,850
Watch out!

184
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,570
Rubber...

185
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,830
Ice Age!

186
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,130
Devil Fruit...!

187
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,750
Th-The sea... froze!

188
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,610
This is the power of a Navy Headquarters' Admiral.

189
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,020
This will probably last at least a week.

190
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,780
Take your time and head in that direction.

191
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,930
You'll get to an inhabited island in four days.

192
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,730
It's a little cold, so dress warmly while walking.

193
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,530
Is this... a dream?

194
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,410
The sea has become ground!

195
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,790
We can now cross the sea! We can get off of this island!

196
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,890
Mr. Marine! Thank you!

197
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,520
This is a miracle! A miracle without doubt!

198
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,230
Well then, we'll get going now.

199
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,490
Yeah. I'm happy for you guys.

200
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,810
Be careful.

201
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,530
I guess there're different kinds of pirates, huh?

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,470
We can't thank you enough.

203
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,510
Not only did you treat our injured, but you also shared your food and water with us.

204
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,270
Don't worry about it.

205
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,970
They say that even a chance meeting is due to karma from a previous life, so...

206
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,430
Take good care of the children so that they don't catch a cold.

207
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,150
In this state, the food will probably stay fresh for a while.

208
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,330
Bye-bye! Thank you!

209
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,520
Thank you very much.

210
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,650
We'll never forget your kindness,Straw Hat Pirates!

211
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,510
See ya! Take care!

212
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,620
Be careful on your trip!

213
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,810
Good, good.

214
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,250
Whoa, it's cold. It's cold.

215
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,830
This is completely like winter.

216
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,040
I can ice skate!

217
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,010
Whoa! That's amazing, Chopper!

218
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,430
Boy, it's cold, it's cold!

219
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm gonna freeze!

220
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,870
Hm?

221
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,790
Hmm...

222
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,010
What?

223
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,070
How should I put it... You're just like your gramps, Monkey D. Luffy...

224
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,670
Wh-What?

225
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,140
You're free-spirited, or should I say you're hard to figure out?

226
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,520
G-Gramps...

227
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,270
Gramps...?! Luffy's?!

228
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,410
Hey, what's the matter, Luffy? You're drenched in sweat.

229
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,280
Well... N-N-Nothing. Um... well...

230
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,490
Your gramps really helped me out a while back.

231
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,850
The reason I came here was to have a look at Nico Robin and you.

232
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,910
On second thought... maybe you should die now, huh?

233
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,590
The government is still taking you guys lightly,

234
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,610
But if I delve into your history, I can tell that your group has a backbone.

235
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,630
Although your group is small, since it's still gathering shrewd members,

236
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,210
it'll probably become a problem later on.

237
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,110
The circumstances that initially led to your search orders...

238
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,870
All the actions you took up until now...

239
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,010
The speed of your group's progress...

240
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,070
I've been dealing with outlaws for a long time...

241
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,320
And it worries me to think how you'll turn out.

242
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,710
Th-That's too sudden!

243
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,330
You said earlier that you just
came to check things out!

244
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,490
The reason I especially regard you guys as dangerous is...

245
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,190
You, Nico Robin.

246
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,790
So you're after Robin after all! I'm gonna beat the crap out of you!

247
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,430
Her bounty amount isn't just an indication of her strength.

248
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,630
It also indicates the level of danger she poses to the government.

249
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,430
That's why you got a 79-million-Berry bounty on your head at the age of eight.

250
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,350
I'm impressed that you survived as a child.

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,870
You betrayed people and ran away. You gained people's favor and used them.

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,650
You've survived in the underworld by being quick to switch sides.

253
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,320
So this is the group that you chose as your next hideout, huh?

254
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,490
Hey, you jerk! How insulting you are!

255
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,030
What grudge do you hold against Robin-chan?!

256
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,490
Stop it, Sanji!

257
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,790
I don't have any grudge against her.

258
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,450
If we are somehow connected...

259
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,050
It's that I let her get away once, that's about it.

260
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,840
It was a long time ago.

261
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,030
You guys will eventually realize it, too.

262
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,870
In the not-so-distant future, you'll regret that you took in a troublesome woman.

263
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:43,190
As proof, the organizations Nico Robin had something to do with up until today

264
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,650
all got annihilated... Except for her.

265
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,190
I wonder why... Nico Robin?

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,930
Stop it, you jerk! Her past doesn't matter!

267
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,460
I see... You really did a good job befriending this lot.

268
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,950
Just get to the point already! If you want to capture me, go ahead and do it!

269
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,380
Treinta Fleurs!

270
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,570
Robin! Stop it!

271
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,010
Oh, my, my... Maybe I talked too much.

272
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,970
How disappointing!

273
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,050
I had too high an opinion of you, thinking you were a little smarter than that.

274
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,030
Clutch!

275
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,430
Ahhh! He shattered into pieces and died!

276
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,970
N-No... We're screwed...

277
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,010
H-Hey! Guys! Run! Let's get out of here!

278
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,750
That wasn't nice.

279
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,190
Ice Saber!

280
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,690
I wasn't going to kill you, but...

281
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,710
Slice Shoot!

282
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,490
Rubber...

283
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,830
Pistol!

284
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,630
It's cold!

285
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,180
He froze them!

286
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,350
Those three... all at once...

287
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,750
O-Oh, no! They have to be treated right away!

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,890
If they get frostbite, their limbs will become gangrenous!

289
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,950
What're you doing, Usopp?! We have to go help those three now!

290
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,330
I-I really would like to, but my body can't move. Did I get frozen, too?

291
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,190
No! You're just too scared to move!

292
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,990
Luffy!

293
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,650
Sanji! Zoro!

294
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,670
Robin! Run!

295
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,510
You've come across some good friends.

296
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,450
But you're still you, Nico Robin!

297
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,120
No...! I'm no longer...

298
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,290
Robin! Watch out! Run!

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,430
I'm...

300
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,930
Robin-chan!

301
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,310
Robin!

302
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,150
You bastard!

303
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,750
Don't yell... She'll still live if you defrost her carefully.

304
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,290
But her body has become fragile, so be careful.

305
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,810
If her body is broken, she'll die.

306
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,590
For example...

307
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,530
If you smash it like this...

308
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,120
Robin!

309
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,830
No!

310
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,460
Stop it!!

311
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,260
Hm?

312
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,370
That was close...

313
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,390
Good job!

314
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,860
Amazing, Usopp!

315
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,110
What the hell...?

316
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,650
Usopp! Chopper!

317
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,490
Run to the ship! Treat Robin and save her!

318
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,190
G-Got it!

319
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,750
Hurry up...! But gently, okay?

320
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,530
It's cold!

321
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,040
You idiot! Think of how cold Robin is!

322
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,330
Don't bother...

323
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,760
It'd be better for the world not to save that woman.

324
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,090
Not to split hairs, but a pirate group is a collection of people like that.

325
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,310
You got that right, lady.

326
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,790
Get out of my way, would you?

327
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,230
Nami-san!

328
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,430
We can't...

329
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,570
Just let you...

330
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,230
Wait, you two!

331
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,700
Don't interfere. I wanna fight him in a duel.

332
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,460
Let us settle this fight, just you and me!

333
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,050
That's fine...

334
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,510
...but since I don't have a ship to take you back in, I'll kill you, okay?

335
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,130
She... can't breathe, can she?

336
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,510
I think she's probably in a state of suspended animation.

337
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,050
Th-Then won't she die if we don't hurry up?

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,790
But if we warm her rapidly, her body will break.

339
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,870
We need to restore her body temperature from the inside.

340
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,890
I-Is this really gonna work?

341
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,120
I don't know... but this is the only way...

342
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,810
You can't just say you don't know! Robin's life depends on you!!

343
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,880
But I've never seen a human whose entire body got frozen like this!

344
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,370
Sure, Aokiji said she was still alive,

345
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,330
but to me, it's surprising that she's still alive!

346
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,750
Don't whine! If you can't do anything, then no one can save her!

347
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,310
You're the doctor on this ship!

348
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,170
I know that! Just shut your mouth for a while!

349
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,080
Chopper!

350
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,950
Ah... What?! Why?! Just the three of you?!

351
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,670
We'll explain it later!

352
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,410
We're gonna go back right away!

353
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,800
Do something about our frozen arm and leg!

354
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,450
Ahh, okay. Let's see...

355
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,490
We have to melt those frozen areas with water immediately.

356
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,850
But we're using the shower room for Robin right now.

357
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,640
Is she okay?!

358
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,150
It's too early to tell.

359
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,650
What?

360
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,320
So will this do?

361
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,750
Once you melt the ice at low temperature, come up to the ship while rubbing the affected parts!

362
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,040
Nami! Help us treat Robin!

363
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,610
Okay!

364
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,090
Why are you guys here? Where's Luffy?! What about Aokiji?!

365
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,950
Luffy said he wanted a duel.

366
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,410
A duel?! And you guys left Luffy there by himself?!

367
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,690
Those were the captain's orders.

368
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,170
Hey! Even if it was the captain's order, you can't just do that!

369
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,830
Aren't you guys a little too cold-hearted?! Luffy is...

370
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,890
Shut up!

371
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,940
It's a duel. Can't you understand?!

372
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,200
Stop it! This is no time for that!

373
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,430
We're... in a crisis right now.

374
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,370
Whether this decision is his passing whim or whatever,

375
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,990
if anything should happen, be prepared to respond to that!

376
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,050
As I thought, you're an odd one.

377
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,050
Rubber...

378
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,080
Storm!

379
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,470
Ice Time...

380
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,650
Let us settle this fight, just you and me!

381
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,490
Darn... I was tricked.

382
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,010
Since I accepted the duel, this fight ends when I win.

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,450
Now I see...

384
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,470
If I mess with the others now, I'd be the senseless one here...

385
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,130
Right, Captain?

386
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,340
Or...

387
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,790
Did you seriously intend to defeat me?

388
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,150
Let me say this.

389
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,790
In the future, Nico Robin will grow...

390
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,770
That woman will definitely grow to be too much for you to handle.

391
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,160
You guys will no longer be able to shoulder the burden of the brutal fate

392
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,290
that Nico Robin was born into.

393
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,730
That's what it means...

394
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,610
...to let her on your ship...

395
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,510
...Monkey D. Luffy!

396
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,710
Breaking you right here, right now and killing you would be very easy,

397
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,150
but we owe you one.

398
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,200
This settles our debt to you for defeating Crocodile.

399
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,850
Also...

400
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,110
Err... Well, I guess I don't have to talk about that idiot Smoker.

401
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,310
See you around!

402
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,010
There he is!

403
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,930
Luffy!

404
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,810
He didn't get broken into pieces!

405
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,680
Good, good...

406
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,090
Lets carry him!

407
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,530
Let's hurry to the ship!

408
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,750
Don't talk at the same time!

409
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,470
According to this island's log, their next destination is...

410
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,530
Hm?

411
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,690
Water Seven... The city of water, huh?

412
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,350
Oh, my, my... They're really getting closer to our Headquarters.

413
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,180
Oops, sorry about that.

414
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,650
Both of them...

415
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,710
Their hearts...

416
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,150
...started beating!

417
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,330
All right!

418
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,330
Luffy!

419
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,310
Robin-chan!

420
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,500
No! You can't go in yet!

421
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,130
You'll make a racket, right?

422
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,550
Hey, Dr. Chopper. I'll make something for them.

423
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,470
Y-You calling me "doctor" wouldn't make me feel happy, you jerk!

424
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,710
Ah, when they wake up, some drinks that can warm them up would be good.

425
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,550
I'll carry them to the lounge later.

426
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,980
Aye-aye, sir!

427
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,210
Nami, are we gonna sail out?

428
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,010
No, we aren't, with our captain like that.

429
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,150
We've already got the log, but let's stay here for today.

430
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,070
Hm?

431
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,570
What's the matter, Usopp? Are you feeling drained?

432
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,750
I wonder if strong guys like him are coming after us from now on...

433
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,110
All I did was get flustered.

434
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,930
Get some sleep, you idiot. You're exhausted.
