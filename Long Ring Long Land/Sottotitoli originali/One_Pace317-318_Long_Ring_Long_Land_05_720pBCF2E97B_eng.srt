It's all right! Now let's move forward

with the sun always in our hearts

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's grab hold of our wishes

Mr. Luffy

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:55,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,570
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,300
but what you cherish most will be right there

I'll always be there to protect you

It's all right! Now let's move forward

with the sun always in our hearts

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,350
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,230
and gaze at the light beyond

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,970
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,580
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's grab hold of our wishes

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,480
under the same flag-- together, we're one

27
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,130
With great drive Straw Hat Luffy gets back on his feet yet again!

28
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,960
Even after countless knockdowns he just gets right back up!

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,000
Luffy...!

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,410
Just what are you?!

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,980
Luffy!

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,040
He's unsteady on his feet!

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,110
Luffy!

34
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,470
And he's out of breath!

35
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,030
This guy is incredible!

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,150
And yet...

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,550
He still stands tall with a glimmer in his eye!

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,120
All for his friends!

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
Yes! Now this is a Davy Back Fight!

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,150
I'm so teary-eyed I... I can't see straight!

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,610
Luffy!

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,480
Luffy!!

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm moved to tears!

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,290
Afro dude!

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,750
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!...

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,610
A Luffy chant comes up from the crowd!

47
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,210
Has there ever been any other foe who's given our boss so much trouble?!

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,670
What do you idiots think you're doing cheering the enemy on?!

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,180
Boss...!

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,160
Boss!

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,400
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,310
Just you watch. I'll end this now!

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,790
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,710
Slow Beam Sword!

55
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,350
You'll have to do better than that!

56
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,000
Damn! He hasn't got enough strength left to run?!

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,210
Okay! It's time to finish this!

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,620
Slow Beam!

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,370
Our boss makes the first move! He starts by slowing down a cannonball!

60
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,830
Foxy Fighter!

61
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,110
A Megaton Punch with the speed of a cannonball!

62
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,130
It'll knock you out for good!

63
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,840
There it is! Our boss's cannonball stunt flying!

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,230
He's going for the finishing blow aboard the Foxy Fighter!

65
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,470
Luffy! He used a beam on you just before the ball!

66
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,050
Dodge as soon as you can move!

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,020
Oh! I can move!

68
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,400
The beam wears off on Straw Hat just a moment sooner!

69
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,710
It's no use!

70
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,590
There's no escape!

71
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,890
Luffy! Look out!

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,330
Here's a present for you!

73
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,060
He got him! All of his attacks nail Straw Hat!

74
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,810
Boss! Boss! Boss!

75
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,430
What's with him?! He didn't have to go that far!

76
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,430
H-H-He's... He's back up!

77
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,050
How...?!

78
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,330
I... win.

79
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,590
What?! You're barely even able to stand upright!

80
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,570
But if that's how you want it I'll pound you until you stay down!

81
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,540
Megaton Nine-Tails...!

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,930
Rubber...

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,420
Rush!

84
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,030
Gatling!

85
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,410
Such intensity!

86
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,530
The combatants now exchange an even more ferocious flurry of punches!

87
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,950
Slaughter 'im Luffy!

88
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,810
Their barrages don't stop! They just keep going!

89
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,770
Luffy!

90
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,810
Slow Beam!

91
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,970
Oh...?!

92
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,280
What the...?

93
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,750
He stopped moving...

94
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,270
S-Straw Hat has been knocked down!

95
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,710
No! Strike that!

96
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,550
Straw Hat is the one who's moving!

97
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,120
Just what has transpired?!

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,310
Curse... you...

99
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,190
How?!

100
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,870
Boss?!

101
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,120
A mirror! A mirror fragment
has fallen from Straw Hat's hand!

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,250
It was stuck... in my afro...

103
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,640
It's from the mirror in your room!

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,040
You little...!

105
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,350
Rubber...

106
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,610
Flail!

107
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,050
Oh no...!

108
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,360
Eight seconds to go.

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,950
Huh?

110
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,410
Huh?!

111
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,570
Could this be what I think it is...?!

112
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,240
Seven.

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,150
What?

114
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,710
Six.

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,440
Boss!

116
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,870
Five!

117
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,690
What are you guys doing?! Start counting too! Four!

118
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,360
What?

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,970
Dunno! But it seems fun!

120
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,290
Three!

121
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,610
Two!

122
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,990
One!

123
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,750
Zero!

124
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,210
Hurray!

125
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,330
Boss!

126
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,040
Our boss is sent soaring!

127
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,190
And he lands...

128
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,860
...outside the battlefield!

129
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,740
The final combat round of the Davy Back Fight

130
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,950
has ended after a heated epic battle between the two captains!

131
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,140
Our boss's legendary record of 920 wins and 0 losses has been broken!

132
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,730
Unbelievably, victory goes...

133
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:25,680
I won't... let you have.. a single member of my crew... even if it costs me my life!

134
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,550
...to Straw Hat Luffy!

135
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,740
Our boss... lost...

136
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,000
Foxy Pirates versus...

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,050
Hey! Don't just sit there! The boss needs our help!

138
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,020
All right! I'll go!

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,500
...the Straw Hats!

140
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,810
I'm going! Move!

141
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,860
I'm going too!

142
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,230
This orthodox-rules three-coin game Davy Back Fight is now over!

143
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,470
Boss!

144
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,730
Boss!

145
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,370
Geez could you have been any more reckless?!

146
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,040
Take this! And this!

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,810
Quit poking him so much! He's seriously hurt you jerk!

148
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,640
He had us worried the entire time...

149
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,330
Afro power my butt.

150
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,340
Afros really are powerful Nami-san!

151
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,710
Oh! He's conscious!

152
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,420
H-Huh?!

153
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,620
The game! How'd the game end?!

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,110
I thought I won... Was it just a dream?!

155
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,530
Don't worry. You won.

156
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,930
That's a relief...

157
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,590
I was never worried in the least!

158
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,220
Liar.

159
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,330
Now that I think about it, I've got no reason to be a pirate for any other ship.

160
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,730
Boss!

161
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,230
You shouldn't be moving yet!

162
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,140
Hey Straw Hat!

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,000
How dare you tarnish my legendary undefeated streak?!

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,150
Boss!

165
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,650
Put 'er there brother!

166
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,890
Boss!

167
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,130
All right Boss!

168
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,750
Spiteful Shoulder Throw!

169
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,010
Boss!

170
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,910
Are you that stupid?

171
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,970
Have you forgotten the rules?

172
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,120
Choose your 500 people already!

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,230
Yes! The final exchange awaits!

174
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,020
Give us your pirate flag!

175
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,690
What?!

176
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,810
You can't be serious! You'd strip us of our pride just like that?!

177
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,910
I don't need your sail. You need it to go places after all.

178
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,790
Wow! He's so merciful!

179
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,550
But our symbol's on there!

180
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,630
How do you expect us to use the sail?!

181
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,410
We don't need your pity! Just take what's yours!

182
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,780
All right.

183
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,700
Since your mark is all we need I'll draw a new one over it for you.

184
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,110
That way you can keep your sail.

185
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,210
Straw Hat... You're such a...!

186
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,090

187
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,130
There!

188
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,110
This sucks...!

189
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,800
Wow they're really grateful!

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,910
No we ain't!

191
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,710
Hey! Straw Hat!

192
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,250
I'll get you for this!

193
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,210
Do they ever stop being comedians?

194
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,330
There there. I won't ride on stilts ever again.

195
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,330
We can follow the village together now however many years it takes.

196
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,410
You folks...!

197
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,770
I went and kicked their butts!

198
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,510
You're really hurt...

199
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,210
This is nothing new.

200
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,950
Thank you...

201
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,210
Ah so that's why you accepted their challenge.

202
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,200
Not like you wouldn't have otherwise though.

203
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,770
Man you're rude!

204
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,830
Wh-What is this?!

205
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,870
Yikes!

206
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,790
I'm the champion! Yo!

207
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,710
Not another weirdo...

208
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,610
Champion of what?!

209
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,740
I'm the world champion of hole-digging!

210
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,040
I'm challenging my own record as we speak!

211
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,840
What kind of challenge has you wrecking the old stilts guy's house?!

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,990
"Old stilts guy"...?

213
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,800
Can you manage while I'm gone?

214
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,960
Sure. But make sure you come back as a champion!

215
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,410
But of course I will!

216
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,020
I promise!

217
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,310
Could it be? Are you...?!

218
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,060
It's me!

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,380
Grandpa!

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,450
Littonto!

221
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,280
I missed you! I missed you so much!

222
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,890
You went and grew so much since I last saw you...!

223
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,500
I'm sorry for worrying you...

224
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
He's your grandson?

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,720
I missed my grandpa so much and that devotion led me to hole-digging!

226
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,160
And before I knew it becoming the greatest digger in the world had become my greatest goal in life...

227
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,510
Isn't this great, old guy?!

228
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,350
Yes. I don't know how to begin thanking you...

229
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll never forget what you've done for us!

230
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,440
Thank you!

231
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,740
Take care on your way home!

232
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,980
You too! I pray for your safe journey!

233
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,500
All right, men!

234
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,570
Let's go find a shipwright!

235
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,470
Yeah!
