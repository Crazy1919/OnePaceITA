00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,110
It's all right! Now let's move forward

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,590
with the sun always in our hearts

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's grab hold of our wishes

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,510

Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,140
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:55,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,570
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,300
but what you cherish most will be right there

16

I'll always be there to protect you

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,360
It's all right! Now let's move forward

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,850
with the sun always in our hearts

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,350
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,230
and gaze at the light beyond

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,970
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,580
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's grab hold of our wishes

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,480
under the same flag-- together, we're one

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,000
Groggy Ring!!

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,550
Our mighty Groggy Ring
combatants have taken the field!

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,930
Opposing them...

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,350
...is the violent cook who kicked
the interference squads'

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,770
butt in Round One; Sanji!

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,770
That's "first-rate cook."

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,180
And the pirate hunter with a bounty
of 60 million; Roronoa Zoro!

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,310
This is what they called us
out here for? What a laugh!

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,540
Right Big Pan?

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,080
Huh?

37
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,060
He can't hear ya.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,740
What's with these guys?

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,900
We'll start with a coin toss.

40
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,010
Tails.

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,060
Tails.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,430
Field or ball?

43
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,600
Ball.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,940
Our Groggy Monsters have chosen the ball!

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,240
The Straw Hat ball man will
enter the other team's mid-circle!

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Which side do you want?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,970
Doesn't matter.

48
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,810
During the game there are two
"ball men" with a ball on their heads!

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,940
Knock your opponent's ball man into your opponent's ring and you win!

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,590
Just get on with it!

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,140
Get in position ball man!

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,160
Hey now.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,730
I don't care how pushy you are.

54
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,500
I still ain't gonna be the damn ball.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,800
I refuse to wear this stupid thing!

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Quit your whining!

57
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,800
Oh! Looks good on you!

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,540
I won't fall for that moron!

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,470
Zoro! Sanji! It's up to you guys!

60
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,300
Win Chopper back! We can't lose now!

61
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,290
I'm really sorry! We're counting on you!

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,980
Whoa a wotan... I've never seen one before!

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,400
I guess they're not as large
as pureblooded giants.

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,530
Cheer them on all you
want; it's still no use!

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,250
Everyone on our team is a Groggy Ring expert!

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,670
What do you want Split-Head?

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,900
He said it again...

68
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh, Boss!

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,500
Now quit doing that Straw Hat!

70
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,280
I doubt I'll need to interfere with this game,

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,470
so I thought I'd watch too.

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,840
Got a problem with that?

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,050
Interference is allowed with this game too?!

74
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,960
Imbecile! It's allowed for every game!

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,400
It's just some people will stoop to anything to help their team win

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,640
while others might insist on a
fair-and-square contest, you know?

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,700
So it depends on the situation.

78
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,710
But if you can't even
handle a little interference

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,490
how can you hope to survive
as a seafaring pirate?

80
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,050
It's a question of character.

81
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,820
That's how you justify it?

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,440
What's with that team of yours anyway?!

83
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,120
If you can even call it a team!

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,430
Talk all you want! Once the match starts
you'll see what they can--!

85
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,760
You went too early just now!

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,100
Did not! I win!

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,730
At everything.

88
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,830
Don't be a smartass!

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,350
We're talking about rock-paper-scissors here!

90
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,680
No you lost!

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,050
Just decide on a ball man already!

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,640
They haven't even agreed on that yet...

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,030
Sanji-kun! That ball looks nice on you!

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,290
I'll do it! I'm the ball man! I'm the worthiest!

95
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,430
It does suit you. You look like a prince.

96
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,390
Of Moronica.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Just start the game!

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,750
Hold on! Weapons are against the rules! Lose the swords!

99
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,410
Huh? Really?

100
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes this is a ball game!

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
It wouldn't be much of a game if weapons were allowed!

102
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,250
I'm fine either way to be honest!

103
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,250
Hey you gonna be okay?

104
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,710
A master swordsman without swords is...

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,760
Is what?

106
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,660
...nothing but a worthless wimp.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,270
Knock it off you guys!

108
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,280
All right! It's now or never!

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,410
The Straw Hats' ball man Sanji has entered the opponent's circle!

110
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,920
Hey cook, I hope you get trampled.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Shut up!

112
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,020
Stomp 'im Big Pan!

113
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,750
The crowd is all fired up!

114
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,950
Big Pan! Let's run-and-gun 'em!

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,320
Huh?

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,260
He can't hear ya!

117
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,340
U-Uhh...

118
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,650
C'mon man...

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,290
Pay attention!

120
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,610
It's not that funny is it?

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,610
The Groggy Monsters are as jolly as always!

122
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,780
Let's get this delightful show on the road!

123
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,090
There's no time limit
and the first team to score wins!

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,030
So we win if we knock Jumbo's
head into the other ring...

125
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,920
And we lose if the cook's head
gets knocked into our ring...

126
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,600
Can Team Straw Hat win back
the reindeer they lost in Round One?!

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,140
Crush 'em!

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,450
Or will Team Foxy swipe
another crew member?!

129
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,920
They're about to clash in Groggy Ring!

130
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,200
The whistle is about to sound!

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Let the game begin!

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,200
What will ball man Sanji do in enemy territory?!

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,970
Will he retreat or attack?!

134
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,790
Let's do it!

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,870
There goes "Tackle Machine" Pickles!

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,180
All right. I'll take care of this myself.

137
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,510
Sling Tackle!

138
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,170
I don't care about you!

139
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,980
I'm only after you!

140
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,690
All we gotta do to win is beat you down!

141
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,820
It's a ball man battle!

142
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,390
Collier...!

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,400
Wh-What the...?! His skin's all slimy!

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,280
Sanji the cook slips and slides
on Big Pan's outstretched arm!

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,200
It's only natural though...

146
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,240
...for Big Pan is a slippery-skinned
wotan of loach origin!

147
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,310
What the heck are you doing?!

148
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,480
Run-and-gun!

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,320
You idiot!

150
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Who are you calling an idiot?!

151
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,260
Punk Pass!

152
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,230
There it is! Big Pan's super-long pass!

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,900
Sanji!

154
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,610
Their leader Hamburg
makes for the landing point!

155
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,340
With Roronoa Zoro racing by his side!

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,700
I'll chop you up if they score a goal!

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,510
Shut up! Quit your whining!

158
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,850
Sweeping Tackle!

159
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,720
Pickles enters enemy territory!

160
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,830
Meanwhile can Hamburg
catch Sanji in the air?!

161
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,430
Yes! And then...!

162
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,130
Gorilla Throw!

163
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
I got it! I got it!

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,600
Waiting for him now is Pickles!

165
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,870
Get back here! I'll teach you to...!

166
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,430
Roronoa moves to intercept but...!

167
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,020
Spinning Tackle!

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,410
What?!

169
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,880
Ball man Sanji is sent flying skyward too!

170
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,590
Sanji!

171
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,760
Bringing up the rear is Big Pan!

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,370
He rushes for the falling Hamburg!

173
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,410
Punk Receive!

174
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,600
Hamburg catches Sanji above
enemy territory! Incredible!

175
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,600
They're within range of the ring!

176
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,610
Stupid Eyebrows!

177
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,430
Here it comes! The Hamburger Dunk!

178
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,710
Wh-What are you--?!

179
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,120
Zoro! Sanji! Do something!

180
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,230
Is it about to end already?!

181
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,960
Don't need to tell me...!

182
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,570
I ain't gonna... let 'em score!

183
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,600
You ain't gonna score!

184
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,980
I'm still in tip-top shape!

185
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,450
I can't let that damn swordsman snub me...

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
...by saving...

187
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,420
...my hide!

188
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,350
No goal!

189
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,430
It looks like ball man Sanji isn't going
to pass through the goal so easily!

190
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,610
Mind your own damn business!

191
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,440
You get thrown around too easy idiot!

192
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,930
A duo as powerful as the
Groggy Monsters has appeared!

193
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,840
We have an epic game on our hands!

194
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,420
This has never happened before!
This is unprecedented!

195
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,890
These behemoths were sent
flying through the air!

196
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,140
The crowd is stunned! Team Straw Hat is formidable!

197
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,910
I don't need you to give me backup!

198
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,240
It's only 'cause I can't count on you!

199
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,020
They're amazing!

200
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,540
They actually threw Pickles!

201
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,640
They sent Hamburg-san flying!

202
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,720
Who asked for your help?!

203
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
You get tossed around too much!

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh no! What are you doing Hamburg?!

205
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,490
Lose and you'll regret it!

206
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,740
Oh but Team Straw Hat is acting strangely!

207
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,260
Although the game is still going
with both ball men in bounds

208
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,970
the two teammates are
arguing instead of playing!

209
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,040
They're funny!

210
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,340
Zoro! Sanji! You idiots!

211
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,960
What are you doing?! Now's your chance!

212
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,810
The other ball man's all alone!

213
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,290
Gang up on him and knock him into the ring!

214
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,000
Huh?

215
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,920
Big Pan goes in for a surprise attack!

216
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
Whoa...!

217
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,920
Too Bad Dance!

218
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,360
What are you running for?! He's the ball man!

219
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,470
Yeah we know! But hang on, he has blades under his shoes!

220
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,840
Hey, Ref!

221
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,890
What happened to "no weapons allowed"?!

222
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,740
Whoa! Can you be any more blatant?!

223
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,370
If he misses a play it's out of his hands!

224
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,360
Quit screwing around Ref!

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,440
Hold on Sanji-kun!

226
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,530
You saw the whole thing! Why are you sweatin' like a waterfall?!

227
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,640
I-I didn't s-see a th-thing...

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,740
Liar!

229
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,180
Hey hold on! He's the ref you know!

230
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,790
Yellow card to Sanji of Team Straw Hat!

231
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,290
Say what?!

232
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,790
W-Wait! Wait! Wait!

233
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,800
And there's the yellow warning card!

234
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,200
One more and Sanji the cook
will get a red ejection card!

235
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,370
I'll eject you!

236
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,350
I can't believe he's scummy enough to attack the referee!

237
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,100
Shut up! I oughta knock you off!

238
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,780
He's a gangster!

239
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,810
We gotta do something about his weapons...

240
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,980
Hold on! You're allowing that now?!

241
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,720
I just happen to be looking away...

242
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,530
Look out there, Ref!

243
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,430
That idiot's using an axe now! An axe!

244
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,360
No! Stop! You can't afford to get ejected!

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,090
Are you kidding me?! I can't let
'em get away with this insanity!

246
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,980
Don't you see?! They want you to get mad!

247
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,140
Pull yourself together!
This is for Chopper's sake!

248
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,390
All right! Then I'll beat him up!

249
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,510
Don't go complicating things!

250
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,810
Sanji-kun! Just beat 'em!

251
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,720
Pose of Love

252
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,610
You don't make any sense...

253
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,660
All right! Back to the game!

254
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,330
You didn't have to start with that again!

255
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
This is gettin' us nowhere!

256
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,530
But we can change our game plan
now that we know they've got weapons!

257
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,200
It's time to take him out!

258
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,070
Stay out of my way! I can handle him myself!

259
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,040
Work together! You're a team you know!

260
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,470
And there they go!
All three are about to collide!

261
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,190
Can't attack where his skin
is exposed! He's too slippery!

262
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,920
That leaves his hands
feet mask and trunks...

263
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,390
Loach Scooping Slide!

264
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,120
Crap!

265
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,730
Loach Racing Circus!

266
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,710
There it is! The Racing Circus acrobatics!

267
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,140
Both opponents slide across his wide back!

268
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,580
Ha! Won't work this time!
I can handle a little skating!

269
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,540
Now they can't escape!

270
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,550
So dizzy...!

271
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,550
Come on you guys!

272
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,970
Meanwhile the other two players
have gotten back into the game!

273
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,430
Oh! They're back in it!
Slaughter 'em!

274
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,490
Oh? Their attire is a little different now!

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,570
Hamburg, their leader is wearing iron knuckles and iron elbow guards!

276
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,370
Meanwhile Pickles has donned
spiked shoulder protectors!

277
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,870
These clearly violate the "no weapons" rule!

278
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,340
Oh, but the referee just happens
to have his back turned right now,

279
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,280
as he does some stretches!

280
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,050
Now I'm mad Leader!

281
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,890
Here goes!

282
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,270
Loach Coaster!

283
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,790
Everything's spinning...!

284
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,060
Let's do it Leader!

285
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,220
Yeah!

286
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,970
Spinning Tackle!

287
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,810
The recovered players counterattack!

288
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,770
But their target isn't the ball man... It's the swordsman Roronoa!

289
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,610
They're sniping him with the iron knuckles!

290
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,740
Hamburger Hammer!

291
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,320
Zoro!

292
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,090
The attack isn't over yet! Big Pan instantly takes an attack stance!

293
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,890
Hamburg prepares to use
his iron elbow guards!

294
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,520
No way!

295
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,250
It can't be...

296
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,830
This is truly dangerous! A horrifying combo!

297
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,430
He's almost like...

298
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,000
...an arrow!

299
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,440
Punk Attack!

300
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,120
Zoro!

301
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,830
It connects! Direct hit!

302
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,220
Note that deaths in Groggy Ring are
to be expected and are of no concern.

303
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
So... dizzy...

304
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,800
Team Foxy isn't ready to stop its attack yet!

305
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,500
Human...

306
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,840
Cannon!

307
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,330
Ugh... I feel sick...

308
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,780
The spiked shoulder protector draws near!

309
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,200
Sanji! Get out of the way!

310
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,260
Sling Tackle!

311
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,250
They're setting up Sanji the ball man now!

312
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,650
Size Attack: S!

313
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,830
Hamburg sends him flying back!
They're not preparing to score at all!

314
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,280
M!

315
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,990
L!

316
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,640
The Groggy Monsters unleash a spectacular team attack!

317
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
That's just terrible...

318
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,230
Zoro!

319
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,080
Sanji!

320
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,610
Looks like Team Straw Hat
isn't getting up from this!

321
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,950
Piece o' cake!

322
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,790
The opponents literally are "groggy"!

323
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,330
All that remains now is to stuff
the ball man into his ring coffin,

324
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,570
and this will be two wins in a row!

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,250
The undefeated Groggy Monsters
are supremely powerful!

326
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,940
We win again!

327
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,990
Hey cook...

328
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,040
Lend me a hand for ten seconds...

329
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,780
Sounds like... a reasonable length of time...

330
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,510
Hey! Look!

331
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,530
Wha...?!

332
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,900
They're up! Team Straw Hat is standing again!

333
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,450
Roronoa the swordsman and Sanji
the cook are terrifyingly tough!

334
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,080
They really know how to make a game exciting!

335
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,820
They're back up! Now get those jerks!

336
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,990
But do these two have
enough strength left to fight?!

337
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,190
Hey you guys...

338
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,600
One Monster Burger please!

339
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,420
Wh-What?!

340
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
What could that mean?

341
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,940
Our boss has just ordered a Monster Burger!

342
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,930
Hold on! They're clearly using weapons now!

343
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,400
Grind 'em up like a burger patty...

344
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,110
And slice 'em good like fresh pickles...

345
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,570
Who are the guests?!

346
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,540
Green lettuce... and yellow cheese!

347
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,330
Crush it all between big pans and you get...

348
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,760
...a Monster Burger!

349
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,520
There it is! Their utterly
horrific triple weapon attack!

350
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,760
There's no escape! Foul play
like this clearly calls for red cards!

351
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,970
Team Straw Hat is in a tough bind!

352
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,410
Oh, but wouldn't you know!

353
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,070
The ref just happens to have
his back turned as he stretches!

354
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,950
What are you doing?!

355
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,920
Stop Luffy!

356
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,810
But...!

357
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,490
They want us to butt in!

358
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,220
We need to grin and bear it Luffy!

359
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,660
Everything's set! The Groggy
Monsters commence their attack!

360
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,430
Whatever happens now don't blame me!

361
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,680
Naturally they go after Sanji the ball man!

362
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,940
Will he be ground up sliced
and crushed into a hamburger patty?!

363
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,200
I can't make much with
third-rate ingredients like you guys

364
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,580
but I'll cook each and every one of you!

365
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,120
You're mincemeat now!

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
Troisième...

367
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
{\an8}Third Rate

368
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
He's fast!

369
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
...Haché!

370
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
{\an8}Mincemeat

371
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,470
Bouquetiere...

372
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,470
{\an8}Mixed Vegetables

373
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,260
...Shot!

374
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,020
Oh no!

375
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,290
Stop crushing!

376
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,090
Leader!

377
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,410
How dare you...?!

378
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,840
Don't forget this is a team battle.

379
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,380
Why you...!

380
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,380
I'll cut you up!

381
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,050
No-Sword Style...

382
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,890
...Dragon

383
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,630
...Twister

384
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,820
M-My word! Big Pan has fallen
victim to Pickles' spinning blades!

385
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,340
Oh no! Dammit...!

386
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,040
Bad Manner...

387
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,680
...Kick Course!

388
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,570
I-Incredible!

389
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,330
The gigantic Big Pan was falling over
but is now upright again!

390
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,030
A tremendous kick has kept
Big Pan on his feet and in a daze!

391
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh! Now Zoro the swordsman charges in!

392
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,410
Naturally he's going after
Big Pan the ball man!

393
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,740
You're not getting past me!

394
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,620
I've had enough of you and the ref!

395
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,590
The crowd-- no the referee-- takes a direct hit!

396
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,690
That was on purpose...!

397
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,630
How dare he... hurt the ref...?!

398
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,270
Red card!

399
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,130
Huh?

400
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,940
My cards and whistle... They're gone...

401
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,280
You're a naughty girl.

402
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,850
Couldn't help it. It's an old habit of mine.

403
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,380
Oh! What's this?!

404
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,860
Is Team Straw Hat arguing again
in front of the lone Big Pan?!

405
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,700
Armée de l'Air Power Shoot!

406
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,700
{\an8}Air Force Power Shoot

407
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,580
I-Incredible!

408
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,810
The gigantic wotan...

409
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,510
What?!

410
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,180
No way!

411
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,680
Big Pan...

412
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,650
is airborne!

413
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,150
Go!

414
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,990
They're headed for the goal ring!

415
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,990
No!

416
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,440
Goal!
