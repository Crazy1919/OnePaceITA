00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,110
It's all right! Now let's move forward

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,590
with the sun always in our hearts

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's grab hold of our wishes

Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,570
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,300
but what you cherish most will be right there

I'll always be there to protect you

It's all right! Now let's move forward

with the sun always in our hearts

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,350
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,230
and gaze at the light beyond

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,970
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,580
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's grab hold of our wishes

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,480
under the same flag-- together, we're one

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,000
Combat

28
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,410
It goes in! Goal! Goal! Goal!

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,710
All right! Zoro! Sanji! You're awesome!

30
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,910
You bums actually did it!

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,710
Y-You did it!

32
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,410
Aww! But I don't wanna give Choppy back!

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,790
Zoro! Sanji! Way to go!

34
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,610
Whoa! They're awesome!

35
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,790
Bravo! Bravo!

36
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm totally moved to tears!

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,170
You guys really are the best!

38
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,190
You dimwits! Who the heck praises their enemy?!

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,590
I can't believe this! No one defeats the Groggy Monsters...!

40
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,690
Oh hi Ref. Wakey-wakey.

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,450
Hurry and blow the whistle! Go on!

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,310
O-Oh right.

43
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,550
His behavior toward me was a flagrant foul!

44
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,190
He's outta the game!

45
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,050
And there's the final whistle!

46
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,910
The Groggy Ring match is over!

47
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,810
Thanks for your hard work!

48
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,530
In Round #2 of the Davy Back Fight,

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,170
Team Straw Hat has unbelievably snatched victory away

50
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,750
from the previously undefeated Groggy Monsters!

51
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,110
Of course we won! Zoro and Sanji would never lose!

52
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,350
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

53
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,250
Did you see that?! Did you fall for me?!

54
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,730
You were wonderful!

55
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,900
You jerks! Don't scare me like that!

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,770
That hurts.

57
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,410
You did great! You did just what I said!

58
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,090
You didn't do a thing.

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,650
Now that Team Straw Hat has won Round #2's Groggy Ring game,

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,070
they're allowed to swipe either a member of the Foxy Pirates' crew

61
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,850
or the Foxy Pirates' symbol!

62
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,390
Who does the Straw Hat captain want?!

63
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,770
Isn't it obvious?

64
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,490
Huh?! Is it me...?

65
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,750
They wanted me from the very start...!

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,650
Oh man... I'm not ready to go yet...

67
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,450
Crap it must be me! Our eyes just met...!

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,350
I bet it'll be me...

69
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,960
Could be me!

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,590
If he chooses me, I'll say goodbye to these guys with a smile...

71
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,110
They like me, I just know it...

72
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,310
Come on Luffy... Hurry...

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,540
Okay! I choose-

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,340
Hold on!

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,480
What is it, Nami?

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,960
Their boss will probably take part in the next round, right?

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,060
If we take Chopper back now but lose in this next round

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,180
they could just steal him again!

79
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,380
In which case taking their boss now

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,240
is the best way to get Chopper back and keep him.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,780
U-U-Unbelievable! Is he going to call for the Foxy Pirates' captain?!

82
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,180
Th-That's the Peanut Strategy!

83
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,600
You guys are the lowest!

84
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,420
You lousy Peanutters!

85
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,740
Fight us fair and square!

86
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,520
There's no rule against it

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,420
but suddenly calling out an opponent's leader after the second round

88
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,080
is an obvious attempt at avoiding a fair-and-square head-on match!

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,600
I can't believe my ears! This is the devilish idea of an inhuman woman!

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,660
Her name is Nami the heathen navigator!

91
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,310
How dare you insult Nami-san?! I oughta filet you!

92
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:07,180
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!

93
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,340
I hate them...

94
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,320
Even if it doesn't go against the rules,

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,200
it seems it would go against pirate ethics.

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm with Nami on this!

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,280
Their reaction's only natural. You're in the wrong, Nami.

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,420
Will you shut up already?! Quit actin' cocky!

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
Our apologies!

100
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,500
Still, like it or not, Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the winning team

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,980
gets to decide how this game will unfold!

102
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,580
He's free to choose anyone he wants from Team Foxy!

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,890
He'll choose me I just know it...

104
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,200
It's obvious I'm the only choice here...

105
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,780
Is he gonna choose me? These guys are cool!

106
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,980
Say, Navigator.

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,740
Your proposal does give us an overwhelming advantage,

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,450
but that also makes their boss part of our crew.

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,900
No thanks.

110
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,220
Now that Team Straw Hat's harassment of our boss has ended,

111
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
it's time to pick someone!

112
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,280
Who will he choose?!

113
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,280
All right then. I wanna take back...

114
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,820
Chopper! Come back!

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh no! Choppy!

116
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,900
Thank you! I'm so happy!

117
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,540
Don't cry! You know we'd never lose!

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,960
Our boss has sunk into the ground from the weight of his feelings!

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,200
I can't believe they all rejected our boss like that!

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,220
Oh, Boss! It's okay! We need you!

121
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,000
We do, Boss!

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
G-Guys...

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,460
Let's teach these guys a lesson!

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,740
Yeah! I can't wait for the next round!

125
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
We love you, Boss!

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,800
Boss!

127
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,980
Guys...

128
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,680
Yes! You are my only true comrades!

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
Thank you!

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,780
Cut the crap will ya?

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Boss!

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,460
I suggest you all ready yourselves!

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,500
What?! I'd never lose to you in a fight!

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
How many times must I repeat myself?

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,880
A fight and a game are two different things...

136
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,120
At last it's time for the final combat round!

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,340
First order of business:
establishing the battlefield!

138
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,020
The two competitors spin the cannon!

139
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,120
And then...

140
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,160
...wherever it stops will be where--!

141
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,280
Hold on! That was clearly not normal!

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,920
The battlefield has been set!

143
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,300
By sheer coincidence it's on the deck of our own Sexy Foxy!

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,700
Coincidence my butt! You idiot!

145
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,950
I'll now explain the rules of combat!

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,520
Everything within 50 meters of where the cannonball landed is part of the battlefield!

147
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,340
In other words, it's a 100-meter-wide circle!

148
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,760
Weapons are allowed as well as
anything else within the circle!

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,360
Only the two competitors are allowed inside the circle!

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Knock your opponent out of the circle and you win! That's it!

151
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,660
Note that the air and water inside the circle still counts as in-bounds!

152
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,860
F! O! X! Y!

153
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,340
Foxy!

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,020
The Flower Cheerleaders are currently on the stage performing cheers for our boss,

155
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,620
while an opening fight is being held aboard the Foxy!

156
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,140
Additionally, the Association of Stalls is selling limited-edition Davy Back Fight merchandise

157
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,820
so be sure to check them out!

158
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,460
We don't need any of this! Just get started!

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,380
{\an8}Note: "Foxy Pins"

160
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,080
...please!

161
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,880
Okay! Limited-edition Foxy pins!

162
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,900
Don't buy their junk!

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
Excuse me. Where's the participant...?

164
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,180
There! Just take him already!

165
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,040
What the hell?! Why does popcorn and a cola cost so much?!

166
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,060
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

167
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,600
Lower it 80%!

168
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,560
Get outta my face!

169
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,000
The boundaries are in place!

170
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,260
This ends the opening entertainment! Thank you for your patience!

171
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,760
Now for today's main event...

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,300
Combat! The bell will ring shortly!

173
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,420
Hurry to the spectator stands everyone!

174
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,340
What's happening?

175
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,500
The sky is turning dark...

176
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,000
This time we're being treated to a captain-versus-captain battle!

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,920
First, in the left figurehead corner...!

178
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
A man who takes on all challengers and boasts a legendary undefeated record

179
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,000
of 920 wins and 0 losses!

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,920
Our boss Silver Fox Foxy!

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
All right...

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Listen up Luffy. You ain't your old self no more.

183
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,700
That hairstyle arouses a man's true wildness.

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,640
Some ask if the champion makes the afro or if the afro makes the champion...

185
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,600
Not even modern science can explain it.

186
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,420
Luffy... With an afro on, your punches will have some serious firepower.

187
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,320
Where's Straw Hat?!

188
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,040
Did he wimp out on us?!

189
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,960
And in the right corner hailing from East Blue!

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,740
The leader of a miniscule pirate band with a 100 million-Berry bounty...

191
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,540
..."Straw Hat" Monkey D. Luffy!

192
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,620
Wow! The afroed Luffy is all fired up in the right corner!

193
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,340
Lookin' sharp Luffy!

194
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you kidding me?

195
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,800
Luffy looks so cool!

196
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,090
He certainly does.

197
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,710
Both fighters have stepped onto the battlefield!

198
00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,770
Can Straw Hat successfully knock our boss out of the circle and protect his crew and pride?!

199
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,910
Or will our boss's legendary undefeated streak strip him of everything he has?!

200
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,930
This final and fateful combat round of the Davy Back Fight is about to begin!

201
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,390
What is all this?!

202
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,990
This is the dressing room.

203
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,690
It's a gloved fight, so choose anything you like.

204
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,680
Awesome!

205
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,070
Wow this is more like a costume room than a dressing room...

206
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,270
Look at all this stuff! And I can use anything I want Usopp!

207
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,240
Hey how about this? Does it look good?

208
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,490
No... This is it...

209
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,110
Hey Straw Hat! Nice fashion!

210
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,450
Your butt is as good as kicked!

211
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,410
Keep your arms tucked in and show 'im your golden right punch!

212
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,230
Yeah!

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,310
Whoa! His brotherly soul is burning red-hot!

214
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,770
Letting Usopp be his corner man was a mistake.

215
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,890
I wish he'd take this seriously...

216
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,430
I wouldn't act so confident if I were you, Champion!

217
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,810
He's liable to bite your head off! Better watch out!

218
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,070
All right, corner man! You're in the way! Scram!

219
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,130
Whoa! My job as corner man is over already?!

220
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,350
Corner man out!

221
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,430
Get goin' already!

222
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,810
You're absolutely right!

223
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,930
There's no need for me to remain here either! I'll leave as well!

224
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,030
What? The stands are...!

225
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,290
Oh cool! I didn't know they did that!

226
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,650
Now then, Straw Hat Luffy. Let's have some fun!

227
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,270
This entire ship is our battlefield! Rampage to your heart's desire!

228
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,030
We have plenty of skilled shipwrights, you see!

229
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,630
By sheer luck this bout is taking place aboard the Sexy Foxy!

230
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,420
What kind of deadly struggle is about to unfold?!

231
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,730
The two pirates are now all alone inside the spacious battlefield!

232
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,410
Boss!

233
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,810
Keep your undefeated streak going!

234
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,690
Win, Luffy! You hafta win!

235
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,110
His beam! Watch out for his beam!

236
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,550
Excitement fills the stands!

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,550
It's plunder or be plundered!

238
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,150
It's one match only with no time limit!

239
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,490
Silver Fox Foxy versus Straw Hat Luffy!

240
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,330
It's a head-to-head battle between these two pirate powerhouses!

241
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,430
The fate of everything hangs in the balance!

242
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,090
Here comes...

243
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,030
...the starting bell!

244
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,490
Let's do it!

245
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,090
Yeah!

246
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,570
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

247
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,070
Slow-Slow Beam!

248
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,530
Only my fist is slow!

249
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,390
You're not so tough! You're all show!

250
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,870
What?!

251
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,590
Come back!

252
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,810
Slow-Slow...

253
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,470
Oh no!

254
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,850
Just kidding!

255
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,190
Wha...?!

256
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,590
Slow-Slow Beam!

257
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,630
Luffy!

258
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,930
He's floating! He's slow even when falling?

259
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,450
I told him to watch out for that!

260
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,090
Aww... Crap...

261
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,750
What's the matter Straw Hat? Ready to throw in the towel already?!

262
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,470
...what...?

263
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,830
Nine-Tails Rush!

264
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,570
Oh! Our boss unleashes a fierce attack right off the bat!

265
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,630
Straw Hat is helpless to do anything!

266
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,570
Huh? He isn't even budging...

267
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,910
No, that's not true!

268
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,110
The effects are slow too that's all!

269
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,450
That was just a little "hello."

270
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,590
The punches themselves didn't hurt you too much.

271
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,180
That much is obvious to me, rubber man!

272
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,810
Darn... it...

273
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,180
Well, your thirty seconds are about up!

274
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,370
It's hitting him all at once!

275
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,080
Oh no! He's going overboard!

276
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,770
Luffy!

277
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,190
Crap! The Slow-Slow Beam is more dangerous than I thought!

278
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,140
Beams sure are nice...

279
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,210
Guess I shouldn't stretch more than I need to...

280
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,270
Where'd that jerk go?!

281
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,230
Damn! I won't get hit by that anymore!

282
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,410
Come out, Split-Head!

283
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,810
Please don't take your anger out on the ears!

284
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,770
A-Another Slow-Slow?!

285
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,890
Welcome to my ship!

286
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,390
Why you...!

287
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,630
He got me!

288
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,990
Calm down, will you?

289
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,770
I'm trying to show you some hospitality here...

290
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,480
Those cannonballs have been Slow-Slow-ed...

291
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,470
If you can ride one then I can too!

292
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,190
Oh...! I wouldn't ride that one if I were you...

293
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,030
Oh, or that one.

294
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,430
Told you so!

295
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,970
Darn it...

296
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,110
Man he's wrecking his own ship...

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,590
I'm just getting started!

298
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,170
Slow-Slow Foxy Face Bombs!

299
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,650
Freaky!

300
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,550
Huh? Pin badges? They're bigger than the one I bought!

301
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,790
Of course we are! We're bombs!

302
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,230
You are?! Yikes!

303
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,630
Huh? A bomb just talked!

304
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,930
I'm... the real deal!

305
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,050
Sorry Straw Hat...

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,710
...but I upgraded my gloves!

307
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,910
And the Face Bombs' 30 seconds are just about up!

308
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,750
Oh yeah! Luffy! The body! The body!

309
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,010
Oh Usopp!

310
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,970
Hey, what's happening with the fight?

311
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,780
Dunno. Beats me.

312
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,290
Are you serious?!

313
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,310
E-Explosions suddenly rock our ship...

314
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,750
...which just happens to be the battlefield...

315
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,750
caused by Foxy Face Bombs that also happened to be loaded...!

316
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,410
Making their ship the battlefield is such a dirty trick!

317
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,830
Hey! Luffy! What's going on?!

318
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,830
Simmer down!

319
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,830
Using this to his advantage, our boss succeeded in blowing up Straw Hat Luffy with a cannon attack!

320
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,370
Is it all over for him?! He's nowhere to be seen!

321
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,530
Whew, that was close!

322
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,370
Indeed, it was a--!

323
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,630
What?!

324
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,610
Quit it! You're annoying!

325
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,510
Straw Hat Luffy is... alive!

326
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,150
Y-You serious?!

327
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,310
He's mind-boggling!

328
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,310
He somehow evaded the close-range cannon barrage!

329
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,230
What speed! I-Is this the true power of a man worth 100 million?!

330
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,090
Of course it is!

331
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,090
Just finish 'im already!

332
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,330
Oh! But it looks like our boss's next attack is already underway!

333
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,390
From out of the resulting smoke screen comes our boss's disturbing laughter!

334
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,550
But where exactly is he?!

335
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,150
What does "Silver Fox" Foxy have up his sleeve this time?!

336
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,650
There he is!

337
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,130
Okay, I hope you're ready!

338
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,510
You got blown up?!

339
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,010
I did not! Don't be stupid!

340
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,570
Liar!

341
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,150
Don't assume for one minute you'll leave this battlefield alive!

342
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,390
Slow-Slow Beam--!

343
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,130
Eh?!

344
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,670
Gum Hook!

345
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,590
No more beams for you! I'm gonna smash your arms!

346
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,970
He disappeared into the smoke again!

347
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,010
Huh?! There you are!

348
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,530
What? A board?!

349
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,940
Slow-Slow Beam!

350
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,750
Now then! Which one is me? Where will the beam come from?!

351
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,890
Darn it! How should I know?! They all look like stupid-heads!

352
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,650
Stupid-heads...

353
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,720
There!

354
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,430
And you call yourself a warm-hearted individual?!

355
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,910
You're in for it now! Look up!

356
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,480
Huh?

357
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,850
Crap! A trap door!

358
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,970
That's what you get for being distracted!

359
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,010
You're the one who told me to look up!

360
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,590
You might wanna pay more attention!

361
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,500
Huh?

362
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,530
Wh-What the...?! Whoa! The floor's moving!

363
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,410
It's dragging me away!

364
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,990
There's Luffy!

365
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,420
Why'd he come out of there?!

366
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,070
Oh no! He'll lose if he falls into the water!

367
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,850
I ain't gonna fall in...!

368
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,850
So close!

369
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,890
Nah it'd be no fun if it ended so soon!

370
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,390
Hang in there, Straw Hat!

371
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,610
Geez! What's with this ship?!

372
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,950
Where'd you go, fox?!

373
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,970
What's this?!

374
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,770
A Foxy pin eerily taunts Straw Hat Luffy after his narrow escape!

375
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,890
In there!

376
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,410
The inside of the ship is our boss's playground! Will Luffy be lured in?!

377
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,790
No, Luffy! It's totally a trap!

378
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,930
He obviously has a bunch of booby traps set!

379
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,290
That jerk! I'm gonna beat his brains out!

380
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,730
Straw Hat Luffy rushes right in!

381
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,150
The battle has moved inside but I can't enter to give the play-by-play!

382
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,570
This is the true essence of this round:
a solitary battle between two combatants!

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,150
Get up! Get up Luffy! Remember your painful training!

384
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,390
Quit playin' around and sit down. I can't see.

385
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,270
Oh, a gun deck!

386
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,230
Man, it's big! I bet Usopp would love this!

387
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,530
Now, where is he?!

388
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,710
There he is!

389
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,260
All right! He's coming after me...!

390
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,690
Now he'll bust through the door at breakneck speed!

391
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,850
Little does he know...

392
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,610
...that this room is filled with spikes!

393
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,650
Now, rush in and get--

394
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh. There he is.

395
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,710
Whoa what's with that room?

396
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,390
Who fires cannons inside other people's ships?! Seriously!

397
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,350
Oh. It's coming back.

398
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,450
You have some nerve! Are you trying to kill me?!

399
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,060
Dammit!

400
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,020
I'll show you!

401
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,980
Oh! He's running away!

402
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,240
{\an8}"Infirmary"

403
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,940
Get back here!

404
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,410
Does this brat have any common sense?!

405
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,450
That's it! Foxy Face Transformation!

406
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,430
Stop right there, fox!

407
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,710
A person?

408
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,500
Dear me!

409
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,290
Whatever's the matter? Do you feel sick?

410
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,970
Where are you sick? The head? Are you sick in the head?

411
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,550
H-Huh?! Did anyone just come in here?

412
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,350
No I didn't see anyone. But never mind that...

413
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,530
What's wrong with you? Your face?

414
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,250
That's weird... I'm sure I saw him--

415
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,290
Hold on! That woman looked like him!

416
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,490
Could it be?!

417
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,710
Hey you! You're that guy's sister aren't you?!

418
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,730
Counter Fox Blow!

419
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,630
Fool!

420
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,870
What is this thing?!

421
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,910
That's weird! He really was in this room!

422
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,560
Is he even trying to fight?!

423
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,180
Oh! The kitchen!

424
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,170
Fish fish! Cut it up sour it up! Carpaccio!

425
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,370
Grill up a sole fa-mi-re-do!

426
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh? Can I help you?

427
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,190
Have you seen a fox with its head split in two who looks like a real moron?!

428
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,610
That's going too far...!

429
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,250
It's you!

430
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,810
I was the lady in the infirmary too!

431
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,390
That thing too?!

432
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,090
Slow-Slow Beam!

433
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,270
Oh... no...

434
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,710
Nine-Tails Rush!

435
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,790
Don't think I lured you in here without a reason.

436
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,310
Go check out what's waiting for you when you get sent flying!

437
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,050
It ain't a living creature.

438
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,070
That'd be against the rules after all.

439
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,970
While a Slow-Slow Beam is in effect any impacts given are stored up and then go off all at once.

440
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,110
Go on now! Your life's final stop lies ahead!

441
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,630
30 seconds are up.

442
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,390
Huh? Where is he?

443
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,890
I'm... right here!

444
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,490
Feh-feh-feh-feh-feh!

445
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,810
And another feh!

446
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,530
I am Pilot Foxy! And...

447
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,890
...let me introduce you to the Gorilla Puncher 13!

448
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,430
A gorilla-like punching machine that's had every single flaw ironed out through constant improvement!

449
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,010
Is the gorilla face really necessary?!

450
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,910
Excellent point!

451
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,210
I mean shut up! Who asked you?!

452
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,810
Go, Gorilla Puncher 13!

453
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,850
How is it moving on its own?

454
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,950
It's a secret...!

455
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,990
You're sure sweatin' a lot...

456
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,150
Shut up!

457
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,250
You think you can dodge these measly punches don'tcha?

458
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,910
Slow-Slow Beam!

459
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,550
What? Where are you aiming--?

460
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,250
Take a look behind you!

461
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,510
Huh? Who's that?! A mirror?!

462
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,870
Yes! Mirrors reflect Slowmo Photons!

463
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,680
Got ya!

464
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,610
Ouch! Ouch!

465
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,270
Oh that hurt? Too hot for you?

466
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,670
I forgot to mention that this thing's punches are flaming hot!

467
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,830
Better watch out! Not even Sea Kings can withstand a beating from this!

468
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,650
Mirror Racket!

469
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,030
We're just getting started!

470
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,970
Slowpoke Ball Demon Coach! A two-sided attack with bouncing beams and punches!

471
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,830
Man, this is irritating! If I can just get close to him...!

472
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,450
Keep running! You'll end up squished between the gorilla and the mirror!

473
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,850
That's it!

474
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,550
I never thought of that!

475
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,570
What?!

476
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,290
Gum-Gum Pistol!

477
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,470
Got him!

478
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,850
Slow-Slow Beam! Beam! Beam!

479
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:22,990
Fool!

480
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,650
Gorilla Punch Golden Hits!

481
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,630
Round Three of this second Davy Back Fight, the combat round, is underway!

482
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,930
What's happening now is anyone's guess, but there's no doubt

483
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,850
a truly epic battle is taking place inside the ship!

484
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,230
Despite not being able to see him, the crowd cheers for our boss!

485
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,590
He ain't gonna lose!

486
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,730
Of course not! He's Luffy! And he has a 'fro!

487
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,980
Being Luffy is more than enough.

488
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,530
That damn fox...

489
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,570
What's so special about an afro?

490
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,510
Does it power you up or something?!

491
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,250
This is taking longer than usual...

492
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,190
Well, the guy is made of rubber.

493
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,590
He's made of rubber and has a 'fro!

494
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,350
Seriously, what's that have to do with anything?!

495
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,530
Oh my! There's activity on the deck!

496
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,730
Who has the upper hand?!
Or could the fight be over now?!

497
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,810
I see two figures!

498
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,550
Our boss is the one still standing!

499
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,330
Boss!

500
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,630
Meanwhile Straw Hat is charred black!

501
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,510
He seems to have taken some seriously heavy punches!

502
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,330
Luffy!

503
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,450
That's impossible...

504
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,790
How could some simple punches burn him?! What did he do?!

505
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,290
Look!

506
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,750
Straw Hat Luffy is up!

507
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,870
Just when it seemed he was down for the count he got back up!

508
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,570
Looks like you barely pulled through, Straw Hat...

509
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,810
It's the brotherly soul! Afro power!

510
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,430
Kick his butt, Boss!

511
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,730
Take this!

512
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,410
This is the Slow-Slow Beam Sword!

513
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,710
I've restrained your arms and legs! But feel free to move anything else!

514
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,210
Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!

515
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,030
Rush!

516
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,210
Rush!

517
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,350
Rush!

518
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,390
Rush!

519
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,690
30 seconds.

520
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,350
He's down for sure this time... No, wait!

521
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,500
Luffy!

522
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,730
Straw Hat Luffy is up!

523
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,930
Whoa! Who is this guy?!

524
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,110
It's gotta be the 'fro! Is it the afro's wildness?!

525
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,530
Stubborn little...!

526
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,830
Take this!

527
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,290
Slow-Slow Beam!

528
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,670
Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!

529
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,510
Dammit, that's not fair! That beam's against the rules!

530
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,390
Usopp!

531
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,790
Whoa! This looks like the end...!

532
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,370
Dealing the punches ain't so easy either!

533
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,590
He's beating him to death out there!

534
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,050
Oh?! Again...?!

535
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,090
A-Again...?!

536
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,690
Luffy...!

537
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,290
I won't let you have...

538
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,830
...any of my crew mates...

539
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,590
...even if it costs me my life!

540
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,930
Luffy...

541
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:12,070
Straw... Straw Hat Luffy is on his feet once again!
