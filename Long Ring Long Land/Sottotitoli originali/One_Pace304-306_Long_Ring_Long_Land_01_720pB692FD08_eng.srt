00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,120
It's all right! Now let's move forward

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,590
with the sun always in our hearts

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's grab hold of our wishes

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,510

Cut through the rainbow-colored wind

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,570
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,300
but what you cherish most will be right there

I'll always be there to protect you

It's all right! Now let's move forward

20

with the sun always in our hearts

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,350
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,230
and gaze at the light beyond

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,970
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,580
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's grab hold of our wishes

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,480
under the same flag-- together, we're one

00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:59,700
Adventure on a Long Island

28
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,350
Emergency report! Emergency report!

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,420
Ship spotted at 12 o'clock!

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,340
Huh? Are they bad guys?!
This is the worst possible time!

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,850
Actually there's no flag or sails!
I don't know what kind of ship it is!

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,440
Seriously nothing at all?!
What are they on the sea for then?!

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,190
Heck if I know!

34
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,400
The crew seems unusually small too...

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,820
Plus...!

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,370
They're looking really timid!
Almost like they're lifeless!

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,990
Sea Monkeys! Run!

38
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,180
Again?!
They followed us?!

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,770
Crap! There's no wind!
Hurry! Furl the sails!

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,270
Row! Row!

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,860
What the...?! Is that ship gonna be all right?!

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,110
The wave's gonna swallow 'em!

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,620
Hey! You guys!

44
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,090
A giant wave and monkeys are coming! Turn!

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,330
Oh!
Whoa! A ship!

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,630
A pirate ship!

47
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,850
Men! Get up! An enemy ship!
Let's swipe their treasure!

48
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,750
Wait! A giant wave's coming!
We gotta escape first!

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,370
We can't let that ship get away!
Ready the cannons!

50
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,360
Who made you boss?! You do it!

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,560
Turn! Someone turn!

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,890
What an unorganized ship...

53
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,190
Forget 'em. They're not on our side.
They wanna steal our treasure.

54
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,650
Which way do we turn?!
How should I know?!

55
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,210
Someone give orders! Navigator!
Don't got one!

56
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,240
Captain!
Don't got one!

57
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,700
Who just fired that?!

58
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,620
Grrr!

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,090
It's no use! It's gonna swallow us!
Damn! You're all incompetent!

60
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,250
You're one to talk!
We can't handle a single wave?!

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,130
It's finally calmed down.

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,780
Those waves were actually
the Sea Monkeys' doing.

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,290
The humidity and temperature
are pretty stable now

64
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,440
so we must already be in
the next island's climate zone!

65
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,760
Hey Robin. See anything?

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,430
An island's been visible for a while.

67
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,700
Why couldn't you say so sooner?!

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,670
Listen! Whenever you see an island say this!

69
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,920
Go ahead!

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Men! I see an island! Yahoo!

71
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,970
Now you say it!

72
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,700
The fog is rather thick.

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,300
Fog? We gotta be careful.

74
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,000
Chopper! Keep forward watch!
Right!

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,880
Hey! Do you know how much we've
been waiting to see an island?!

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,810
I'm sorry. I'll be more mindful.

77
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,170
Really? In that case okay.

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,040
Hey is anyone else curious
about that ship from earlier?

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,000
They said they had no captain or navigator

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,170
and they didn't even have flags
sails motivation or organization...

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,510
What kind of pirates
would go around like that?!

82
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,100
Probably got into a battle and lost.

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,970
And their captain died
and they got plundered...

84
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,850
No that can't be it!
I got a good look at their ship!

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,100
There weren't any signs of a battle at all!

86
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,480
Yet the ship was completely bare of
all the essentials that pirates need!

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,440
So they weren't pirates then.
Don't worry about it.

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,870
But they sure seemed like pirates to me...

89
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,200
I somehow get a bad feeling about this...

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,460
You always do.

91
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,630
Okay! I wonder if there's a town!
I hope they have a shipyard!

92
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,960
Luffy! Don't go jumping off right away!

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
I hope we'll get a good shipwright to join us!

94
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,010
We're near the shore! Get the anchor ready!

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
C'mon guys... Listen to me...

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,630
Chopper! Usopp's got the
"Can't Go On the Island" disease!

97
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,980
There's no cure for that.

98
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,350
All right! All right!

99
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,110
There's nothing at all!

100
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,570
What is this place?! So cool!

101
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,370
It's all grass as far as I can see!

102
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,170
Man what a dull place.

103
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,380
Do you suppose anyone lives here?

104
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,790
Yahoo!
Hey!

105
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,650
Me too!

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,160
Sheesh. They barge right into
uncharted territory like it's nothing...

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,980
With a view like this
it's clear there's no danger.

108
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,140
What is it Choppe-?

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,800
A human?

110
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,300
No human's this fluffy and shaggy!

111
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,510
It's a bear!

112
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,030
Whoa! So long! A long bear!

113
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,670
So high up!

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,270
Hey! This is an apple! It's so long!

115
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,240
Don't eat it!
Yum!

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,240
All the other trees are crazy tall too!

117
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,710
Hey look! Is that a house?!

118
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,700
Yeah it looks like it.

119
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,220
Let's check it out!

120
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,350
It's your relative!

121
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,390
That's a deer! I'm a reindeer!

122
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,690
Man talk about long...

123
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,910
Why is everything here so loong?

124
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,120
I feel like just looking at them's
gonna make me looong too...

125
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,120
Just what kind of island is this?

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,390
Hi! We're coming in!

127
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,040
Just like that?!

128
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,850
H-Hold on Luffy! I bet this is
where the boss of the island lives!

129
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,470
He's gonna be some horrifyingly long
snake-man monster! I just know it!

130
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,720
No one's here.

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,850
Hey! Luffy! Usopp! I found a giraffe!

132
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,890
What?!

133
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,070
That ain't a giraffe...

134
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,990
It's got a long neck
but it's a horse. A long-horse...

135
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,230
You're a horse?

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,210
What a pretty horse!

137
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,410
She's a girl! She says her name is Shelly!

138
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,200
This saddle must mean
someone's here after all...

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,070
What's up Luffy?

140
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,750
Usopp.

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,470
See those two bamboo trees?
Yeah.

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,950
Whoa! I can't see their tops! Talk about long!

143
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,010
Take a closer look...

144
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,850
Okay...

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,140
They're running away!

146
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,270
Wha...?! This must be another long animal!

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,030
The bamboo tree's attacking Luffy!

148
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,030
H-Hey! You all right?!

149
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,610
I can't let you beat me bamboo!

150
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,160
Careful Luffy!

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,560
Rubber Whip!

152
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,850
All right! You beat it!

153
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,040
Yeah! I cut it!

154
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,640
Where's your owner?

155
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,680
You don't know? That sounds lonely...

156
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,650
It could be bad guys! Stay there and hide!

157
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,530
What's going on?!

158
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,650
Actually...

159
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,260
...I cut a bamboo tree and a spirit appeared!

160
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,860
Our ship's... been blocked from leaving?

161
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,090
What are they planning?!

162
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,640
That's the ship I saw earlier...

163
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,330
Who are you guys?!

164
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,830
If it's a fight you want get down here!

165
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,330
We are the Foxy Pirates!

166
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,340
Don't be hasty! All we want... is a showdown!

167
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,170
A spirit?

168
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah. He appeared after I cut the bamboo tree.

169
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,630
Hey. Say something you.

170
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,850
Of course I remember you.

171
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,060
It's been a long time. How are you guys?

172
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,230
One of you knows him?

173
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,810
Nope.
Me neither...

174
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,280
Ah no wonder I didn't recognize you.

175
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,450
Whoa what a flake! Who are you old guy?!

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,330
Nomad
Tonjit

177
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,110
My name is Tonjit. You have my thanks.

178
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,040
I assume you're the ones
who knocked me off my stilts?

179
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,370
Stilts?

180
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,310
Oh! They are!

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,540
But they were so long
we couldn't see the top at all!

182
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,220
Indeed. I was at the very top!

183
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,640
Oh so you're not a spirit that came
out because I cut a bamboo tree

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,940
you're an old guy who fell
'cause his stilts broke?

185
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,230
Why were you on such long stilts anyway?

186
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,900
I've always been fond of stilts

187
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,700
so I tried to make the world's longest
stilts using this island's bamboo!

188
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,660
I managed to get on them but then
I was too scared to come back down!

189
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,160
You're crazy old guy!

190
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,500
I was up there... for ten years!

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,670
You're really crazy!

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,710
You were on stilts for ten whole years?!

193
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,380
That's right. The bamboo continued
to grow the entire time too...

194
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,680
Making it even harder
for me to come back down...

195
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,810
So scary...

196
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,850
That's your only comment after ten years?!

197
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,350
There are many trees on this island
just as tall as the stilts though.

198
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,320
I was able to survive on fruit I could find.

199
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,400
He talks about it so casually.
Especially after being up there for so long...

200
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,150
Speaking of long...

201
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,780
Why is everything on this
island so long old guy?

202
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,040
It might seem that way to an outsider
but there is a reason.

203
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,250
As you can see a giant
grassy plain covers this island.

204
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,170
In short everything here is long
due to a longing for excitement.

205
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,880
Whoa. He went and said it.

206
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,550
Over there for example...

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,140
..is a plaaatypus.
You just said it longer!

208
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,800
That's a Daaachshund.

209
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,410
Be careful. There are ferocious animals too.

210
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,700
See? That's a snow leooopard.
Don't let it bite you!

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,850
Leopard?!

212
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,170
Why is it only long sideways?!

213
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,450
Come to my house! I'm in your debt!
Let me offer you some hospitality!

214
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,280
All right! Food!
Yeah!

215
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,320
It's custom in this village to treat
visitors to milk from our farm animals.

216
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,450
Village? Where's the village?

217
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,650
And your farm animals...

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,590
The village is gone! And the farm animals!

219
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,700
Get real. Villages don't just
disappear in ten years you know.

220
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh actually...

221
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,450
Well I can explain it later.
For now, let me treat you.

222
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,960
I believe I had some milk stored away...

223
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,840
Stored away? You realize you were
on those stilts for ten years right?

224
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,600
Hopefully this cheese is to your liking...

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,470
Don't look away! That's obviously
your ten-year-old milk!

226
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,940
I see. That's a shame.

227
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,810
Please make yourselves at home then.

228
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,610
Huh? This cheese is edible old guy?

229
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,970
Don't even try!

230
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,450
It's okay! It's only ten-year-old cheese!

231
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,750
Unlike you folks I live a
laid-back life on this island.

232
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,290
It's made my stomach different from yours.

233
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,570
Honestly now. Whippersnappers
these days are so frail...

234
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,980
Call... a doctor...

235
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,130
I told you so you idiot!

236
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,630
Doctor! Doctor!

237
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,430
Th-That's me!

238
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,260
It's food poisoning.

239
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,220
Obviously!

240
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,060
You're funny old guy!

241
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,770
You're nomads?

242
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,570
Yes. We're carefree nomads
 that're always on the move.

243
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,700
So that's how your village
disappeared after only ten years...

244
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,240
This is the island of
Long Ring Long Land. Welcome.

245
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,360
It's technically a single ring-shaped island

246
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,190
but because of the sea it's usually
divided into ten separate islands.

247
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,610
But on one day a year
the tide gets especially low,

248
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,620
and for those few hours the island
regains its true singular form.

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,750
We use this fact to migrate from one
island to the next every three years.

250
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,980
So you got left behind
after the village moved?

251
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
I like you old guy! You're a big dummy!

252
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,070
If they stay on each island for three years,

253
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,270
then it'd take 'em thirty years
to come all the way back here.

254
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,880
Taking away the time you
were stuck on those stilts

255
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,730
you won't see them again
for about twenty more years...

256
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,860
Pretty much.

257
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,950
If I only I had a hooorse.

258
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,180
I could catch up to the others in five years...

259
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,140
By crossing to a new
island once every year...

260
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,120
"Hooorse"?

261
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,790
Yes. The most beautiful
animals on these islands.

262
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,960
They gallop through the
grassy plains so gracefully...

263
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,430
They're absolutely necessary
to migrate from island to island.

264
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,210
They're strong and can carry large loads.

265
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,560
I can't migrate on foot either.

266
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,980
The tide would come back in before
I even got across to the next island.

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,650
Can't you just take a ship?

268
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,300
We don't know how to sail.

269
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,030
Besides even if we charged a Log Pose here,

270
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,220
it wouldn't point to the
next island in the ring.

271
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,990
All ten islands are actually
one big island after all.

272
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,930
I'll just wait here for twenty years.

273
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,630
You sure? It'll be lonely...

274
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,090
Oh wait!

275
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,130
Is a "hooorse" a "horse"?

276
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,890
Oh right! A horse! We saw one!

277
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,270
Oh! Shelly! You waited for me?!

278
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,230
Oh Shelly! You're so adorable!
This sure brings back memories!

279
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,150
You've grown so long since I last saw you!

280
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,450
That's a good girl!

281
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,580
You must've been so lonely
all by yourself all those years!

282
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,870
Thank you! Thank you!

283
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,650
I'll never leave you again!

284
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,890
Ah so that horse was waiting
for him the entire time...

285
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,650
She's great!

286
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,370
She must really like him a lot!

287
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,250
Man that horse sure is
fast! I wanna ride too!

288
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,670
She really is graceful!

289
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,630
Shelly. Let's cross the sea
together on the next low tide day!

290
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,090
All those days with rain...

291
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,260
All those days with snow...

292
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,760
Thank you for waiting through it all!

293
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,900
Shelly... Do you really insist
on waiting for Tonjit-san?

294
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,200
We're going to take all
your friends with us...

295
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
Are you sure?

296
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,810
We won't be back here for 27 years,

297
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,590
and we have no idea where Tonjit-san even is.

298
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,920
You'll be all by yourself!

299
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,540
Take my advice and come with us!

300
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,040
Live well Shelly!

301
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,590
Whoa there Shelly!

302
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,620
You know I'm afraid of heights!

303
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
Horse!

304
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,900
Old guy!

305
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,460
Shelly!

306
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,400
You okay?!
We heard a gunshot!

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,740
What's this net?!

308
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,660
Old guy!

309
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,390
The horse is mine now!

310
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,750
Yeah! Yeah! That horse is our boss'!

311
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,500
Who are you guys?!

312
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,150
Who am I you ask?

313
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,670
They're so rude!

314
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
Don't pretend you don't know this face!

315
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,500
I don't know your face! I'm gonna beat it up!

316
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,760
Th-They don't know me...

317
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh no! Boss! Don't get depressed!

318
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,060
He's lying! I bet he's just saying that!

319
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,510
He can't possibly know him.

320
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,100
Stop laughing Hamburg!

321
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,090
My name is Foxy! I take whatever I want!

322
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,270
Let this be a lesson you fools!

323
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,140
Why are you so worked up
about a single horse?!

324
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,740
Hunting is nothing more than entertainment!

325
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,450
Why you...!

326
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,280
Rubber...!

327
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,870
Stop Straw Hat Luffy!

328
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,740
How do you know my name?!

329
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,180
Of course we know who you are!
We've done our homework!

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,030
Monkey D. Luffy with a
100 million-Belly bounty.

331
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,710
Roronoa Zoro with a 60 million-Belly bounty.

332
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,770
A total bounty of 160 million
with only seven people...

333
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,970
That's really something.

334
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,470
We Foxy Pirates challenge you
Straw Hats to a Davy Back Fight!

335
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,190
Stop talking crazy! Just bring it on!
If you wanna fight let's fight!

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,420
Wait Luffy... A Davy Back fight is...

337
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,150
Ah! That explains the ship
we encountered near here!

338
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
Which way do we turn?!
How should I know?!

339
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,510
Someone give orders! Navigator!
Don't got one!

340
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,460
Captain!
Don't got one!

341
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,500
Hold on Luffy! That game...!

342
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,170
Don't do it! We'll lose crew members!

343
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,050
What's the deal Usopp?!

344
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,970
I'm telling you don't agree to his game!

345
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,060
Fool! I heard you say it Straw Hat Luffy!

346
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,300
You clearly agreed to my challenge just now!

347
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
Foxy Pirate
Foxy The Silver Fox
Bounty: 24 Million Belly

348
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,760
Didn't he Porche-chan?!

349
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,230
Yes Boss! I heard him too!

350
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,360
Foxy Pirate
Fighter
Porche

351
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,330
Do you honestly think you can back out now?

352
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,550
Well you can't.

353
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,570
Foxy Pirate
Fighter
Hamburg

354
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,370
Or what? You're not man
enough to keep your word?

355
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,780
I am too!

356
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't get talked into it!
But... the horse!

357
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,360
Shelly... Oww!

358
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,790
Don't push yourself! You hit your back hard!

359
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,260
You two! Step aside!
Old guy!

360
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,310
Shelly faithfully waited ten
years for me! How dare you!

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,600
Wait old guy! They're pirates!

362
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,650
A Davy Back Fight?

363
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,810
That's right! The fight begins the
moment two captains are in agreement!

364
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,360
{\an8}"Unruly"

365
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,610
As we speak our captain
is challenging your captain

366
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,620
Monkey D. Luffy to battle!

367
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,530
Challenging? Why bother?

368
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,870
If you want a fight just start one!

369
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,170
Hey you've never heard of a Davy Back Fight?

370
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,990
It's not a fight. It's a pirate game.

371
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,630
Yes. A game that supposedly arose
long ago on Pirate Island.

372
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,830
Which is said to be a pirate
paradise somewhere in the sea.

373
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,850
In it pirates plunder each other
for top-notch crew members.

374
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,190
Pirates plunder each other?!
Yes.

375
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,570
I'm amazed you've survived this
long without even knowing that!

376
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,150
A Davy Back Fight is about
swiping crew members!

377
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,620
After each match the winner can take...

378
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,160
any crew member they want
from the opposing team!

379
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,190
Whoever's chosen must immediately
swear loyalty to their new captain!

380
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,130
In the name of Davy Jones,
the pirate of the deep!

381
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,510
So if you lose... you lose a crew member?!

382
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,090
That's right!

383
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,890
In addition... if the enemy ship
has no one of interest...

384
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,700
They can instead be stripped of their
Jolly Roger, the life of their ship!

385
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,470
So crewmates and pride are on the line.

386
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,080
Winning will make you stronger,
while losing will mean a serious loss.

387
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,400
What a vicious game.

388
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,460
Wait... does that mean
that ship we ran across earlier

389
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,240
without an organized crew
sails or even a captain was...?

390
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,540
Oh? Did you run into the
Fang-Frog Pirates' ship?!

391
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,000
They fell prey to our game earlier!

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,140
Say hello to our new crewmates!

393
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,560
Yeah! Long live the Foxy Pirates!

394
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,020
I was the former captain of that ship!

395
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,460
Former ship doctor!
Former navigator!

396
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,730
Former shipwright!

397
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,570
We tried five three-coin
games but lost 'em all!

398
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,990
Fourteen men and our flag
taken just like that!

399
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,740
With so many people jumping ship like this,

400
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,540
it was more like a merger than anything!

401
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,530
Yeah!

402
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,730
There's no talking reason with you!

403
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,540
But we'd never agree to such a
ridiculous game in a million years!

404
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,510
Fool! A regular crew member
can't make that decision!

405
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,660
This game only begins when
two captains reach an agreement!

406
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:57,470
Like it or not you're all in this game
if your captain nods his head!

407
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,590
They're right Nami-san.

408
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,480
This is an unwritten rule
in the pirate world.

409
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,400
Run and we'll be completely humiliated.

410
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,860
So what if we're humiliated?!

411
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,330
I'd rather die than live in shame.

412
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,830
What he said.

413
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,870
Are you two crazy?!

414
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,880
Forget about it. This is how men are.

415
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,720
Urgh! I gotta stop Luffy then!

416
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,140
Don't bother. It's no use.

417
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,980
The captains will signal
the start of the fight

418
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,220
by firing shots at the same time!

419
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,550
Just sit here and...!

420
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,560
Please no...!

421
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
He agreed to it...

422
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,980
Fine by me.

423
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,810
This should be interesting.

424
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,830
He's agreed to the game!

425
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,920
You idiot! You idiot! You idiot!

426
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,590
Why did you agree to it?!

427
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,260
You have no idea how horrific this game is!

428
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,880
Then we just won't lose!

429
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,500
Our challenge is now officially accepted!

430
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,060
Yeah! I'm gonna kick your butt!

431
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,850
That'll be the day!

432
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,230
I will too Split-Head!

433
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,610
Split-Head...?
Boss!

434
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,580
How dare you?! Our boss is a sensitive man!

435
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,790
He has a heart of glass.
Doesn't suit him though.

436
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,040
Hey! I told you not to laugh!

437
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,910
Look Luffy!

438
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,080
Thinking about the horse and the
old guy makes me mad too but...!

439
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,540
Use that anger to thrash 'em!

440
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,630
He got back up way too fast!

441
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,850
Leave it to me!

442
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,180
I'm going to teach you a thing or two!

443
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,220
Frankfurters! Get your frankfurters!

444
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,990
Rum and cheese! Crackers and salted meat!

445
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,480
I've got fried buckwheat noodles too!

446
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,480
It's time for the opening ceremony!

447
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,820
Please quiet down! Please quiet down!
Shut up! You be quiet!

448
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,110
C'mon! Let's hear the odds!
All participants get ready!

449
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,920
This is looking fun!

450
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,160
These are all Split-Head's crew members?

451
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,220
Wow! There's so many!

452
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,120
Hi. Five jumbo fried buckweats please.

453
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,600
Cotton Candy

454
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,060
Fried Buckwheat Noodles

455
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,060
Stop that old guy!

456
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,540
Okay men! Simmer down!

457
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,840
Porche-chan!
Sexy!

458
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,050
It's time for the pledge to follow
these three rules about losing!

459
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,250
First the only way to take back crewmates
Jolly Rogers or anything else

460
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,020
is through another Davy Back Fight!

461
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,860
Second anyone taken by the winner...

462
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,490
must swear loyalty to that
ship's captain immediately!

463
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,330
Third if your Jolly Roger is taken
you can't ever display it again!

464
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,750
Nami-san! I bought some cotton candy!

465
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,080
How can you guys be so calm about this?

466
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,040
Are you still moping about that?

467
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,880
Should you break these rules
you'll be considered dishonorable pirates

468
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,760
and sent to Davy Jones' Locker!

469
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,550
Do you swear to uphold them?

470
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,350
I swear!
I swear!

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,550
I hereby announce this three-coin
orthodox-rules game...

472
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,380
...to Davy Jones!

473
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,750
Who's Davy Jones?

474
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,620
An old pirate cursed by the devil...

475
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,020
who's said to live in the depths
of the sea to this very day.

476
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,390
He lives at the bottom of the sea?!

477
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,900
That's what the legend says.

478
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,280
All the ships and treasures
that sink into the sea

479
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,440
are said to go to his ship's hull--
his "locker" in other words.

480
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,590
The bottom of the sea is scary...

481
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:03,950
Sweet!

482
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,610
Pirates call this a Davy Back

483
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,660
because you steal whatever
you want from the enemy

484
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,960
just as Davy takes everything
that comes sinking his way.

485
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,480
A captain, a swordsman,
a navigator, a sniper,

486
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,560
a cook, a doctor, and an archaeologist, huh?

487
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,560
Well then. Who shall I take first?

488
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,860
I guess it'd have to be that one!

489
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,860
Sheesh!

490
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,450
You've gotten us into a real mess Luffy!

491
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,290
All we gotta do is win!

492
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey! You forgot somethin'!

493
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,320
Write down your rosters and
give them to our party organizer!

494
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,650
Once you've chosen
your roster it's set in stone!

495
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,240
Hey what if we lose?

496
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,070
I bet they'll want Captain Usopp...

497
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,580
No I bet it'll be me. Because I'm cute...

498
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll now announce the rosters
submitted by both teams!

499
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,920
Actually my "Can't Be in a Race"
disease is kicking in...

500
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,350
Round 1:
Donut Race

501
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,350
Contestants:
Usopp, Nami, 
Nico Robin

502
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,850
I don't wanna do it either
you know! Just accept it!

503
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,400
Don't go slowin' me down!

504
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,000
Round 2:
Groggy Ring

505
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,000
Contestants:
Zoro, Sanji, Chopper

506
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,860
That's my line!

507
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,820
I'm... gonna try my very... hardest!

508
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,700
Round 3:
Combat

509
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,700
Contestant:
Monkey D. Luffy

510
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's do it!

511
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,620
I, Itomimizu, the Foxy
Pirates' party organizer

512
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,980
will be your commentator
for this competition!

513
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,010
First up is Round One; the Donut Race!

514
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,580
Boats for the Donut Race can only be made

515
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,290
from two oars and three empty barrels!

516
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,550
Use of any other materials
means instant disqualification!

517
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,930
This is a chance for
shipwrights to show their stuff!

518
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,910
Time is nearly up! Is everyone ready?

519
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,000
The Straw Hat team of Navigator Nami,

520
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,840
Sniper Usopp, and Archeologist Robin!

521
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,590
They'll be riding the Barrel Tiger!

522
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,730
That orange-haired chick is hot!

523
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,460
I want that dark-haired girl on our crew!

524
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,500
Don't need that other guy!
Yeah. Never mind him.

525
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,710
Oh! The final odds are in!

526
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,330
The top spot obviously goes to our idol,

527
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,310
the member of the powerful
Team Foxy: Porche-chan!

528
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,390
Ooh! Just leave it to me!

529
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,640
With her is the swordfish fishman
Capote and the star shark Monda!

530
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,740
They're riding in the Cutie Wagon!

531
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,740
This'll be a cinch! You can do it!

532
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,790
Hold on! You're using a fish!

533
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,750
There's no rule against fish you know!

534
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,100
I'll be providing commentary during the race

535
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,360
from atop Chirp-Chirp a rare
South Blue Super Sparrow!

536
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,730
Are you sure this won't sink?!
I already told you...

537
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm not a shipwright!

538
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,820
Okay! On your marks!
